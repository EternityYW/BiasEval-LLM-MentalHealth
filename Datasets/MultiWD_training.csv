"I feel like my life is spiraling downwards getting worse each day. My dad has ALS, my mom is stressed out to the max taking care of a husband who is a selfish unappreciative jack wagon. I have to deal with a bullish, vindictive shithead for a manager that makes me dream of breaking his kneecaps inward, no friends, no woman, no life. My faith is growing dimmer by the day because of asshats who ride in on a hypocritical high horse. My doc says with my depression, anxiety, and high blood pressure, I wont live to see 35. Most nights, virtually every night, I go to bed a bit more angry, a bit more suicidal, and hoping, praying to a god who couldn't give a rat's ass about me to either give me cancer or do not allow me to wake up. My only vent is either here, where we all fight enough of our own battles to not worry about anyone else's (I'm not blaming anyone) or smoking black and milds.

"You know this feeling when there are people around you but you feel that you're not part of that group - that cheer - feeling more of a spectator than anything else.

I don't want them to know. I don't want anyone to know. Why would anyone care? I somehow thought it would be a good idea to come here. I don't know why.

"A few months ago (possibly more, my perception of time isn't great right now) my best friend started having seizures, and a tumour was discovered in his brain. Since then he's been through various rounds of radio and chemotherapy, and today had the results back from a recent scan. The tumour has reduced massively in size, and the parts they were really concerned with appear to be gone. This is brilliant news! And while I feel a sense of relief, and am no longer fixated on ""what if it's terminal?"", I just can't seem to feel any positivity. I don't want this to have an impact on our relationship, but I feel like I'm withdrawing and slipping away from him. We used to live together, but he's back living with his parents (since before the tumour) due to other issues. I'm trying to be there for him, but between work and constantly feeling like shit, I feel like I'm letting him down. I don't know whether I'm asking for advice or just ranting.

"Spent all day on the phone with my family crying. I‚Äôm not sure I have the strength to carry on anymore. I‚Äôve had to be ‚Äústrong‚Äù for such a long time and I can‚Äôt do it anymore. I‚Äôve been thinking about dying for a really long time. Multiple times a day, and after a lot of research I‚Äôve sort of unofficially settled on hanging in the absence of a better method. I realized I didn‚Äôt have anywhere to suspend from so that‚Äôs been a deterrent for most of this (or I should say last) year. But today I realized my door is high enough and sturdy enough to hang myself from and I‚Äôve been crying all day and feeling at rock bottom so I decided to test a possible hanging rig. I got my scarf around my neck and tightened it to the point that my face felt swollen and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. Kept it for a few seconds until my heart started to pound suddenly so I undid it. It wasn‚Äôt as unpleasant as I thought it would be. It wasn‚Äôt great but it was surprisingly not as unpleasant as I had always anticipated.

"espa√±ol Sorry for the bad english, i don't have anyone else to talk. This week has been very hard. I've hated myself more than ever and even taking my medications has failed to dispel the emotional pain I feel. I spent the whole year struggling with my depression and even hiding so that my boyfriend doesn't have to worry about it more, and why, so that he decides to cheat and justified by the stress, and the needy that I tend to be. God, I do not know how to explain the pain I feel, her mother speaking bad about me, threatening to talk to my family because she thinks i'm not good enough for her son, blaming me for her son's problems.

For years I've wanted to reconnect with the people I shut out, but I've become trapped in a self-destructive cycle where I'm too ashamed to admit my problems to the same people I just want to make proud. I've lost every job the same way. Whether it's throwing up in the bathrooms at work or failing to muster up the courage to even call in sick, it finds its place in the worst possible ways without fail. It's been like this for years. I live at home with no job, no car, not even highschool degree four years after I should have graduated. I don't even have a driver's licence. I've been hospitalized twice, both times in relation to this problem that just won't go away. Nothing works. Every day I'm met with opportunities but pass on every single one of them.

"The method of suicide I selected is hypothermia. There's a river near my house with 40 degree water Fahrenheit, 4 degrees Celsius. Being in there at night, no one would see me. I would tie a rope to a life jacket and confine myself to a tree so I don't drift along the current to a spot where someone would find me. Death would occur within a couple of hours of being in the water, and unconsciousness would happen before then. This method is easy to pull off because it doesn't involve highly intense pain, and I can get out if I really want to. The problem is that this isn't going to work soon, due to the warmer seasons approaching. I have to quickly decide if I want to die.

"I know a lot have been discussed about SSRI and their potential sexual side effects. For the last 6 months I have been on Fluoxetine and Duloxetine (my shrink thinks that my depression is a result of bad things that happened to me and was planning to wean and stop them within 1 year). However, I had to take a drug screen for work and I read that Fluoxetine can give a false positive result in the UDS and I didn't want to tell my potential employer that and take anti - depressants for the fear of stigmatizing. Anyway, I stopped both SSRIs 1 week before the test (now is 10 days without them) and I don't feel any different, in fact if anything, I feel happier, but the most striking was my marked increase in my libido and the capability to ejaculate once again :) When I was on the SSRIs I had turned into an asexual creature and if I ""force"" my self to have sex or watch porn I had a half - @ass erection and (kind of whiskey d!ck) and more often than not I had to fake and orgasm (using a condom) or if by any chance I can finish is after a long ""banging"" and with an almost painful spasms of my legs, really weird sense. Now I feel like I am a 30 yr old (I am mid - 40s) - have a ""morning wood"", I regained my interest in sex, I am able to ejaculate, etc. I am nervous to start the meds again, but don't want to go back to the deep depression that I was before in case they had any effect.

"When I was 15-16 years old, I posted here in my darkest moments. I couldn't see any reason to keep living. I thought I was nothing special and the next 8 years seemed like an endless slog. You can look through my post history if you want. Since then, I graduated college and graduate school. I have traveled the world. I swam with bioluminescent algae in Indonesia. I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world, and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn't kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become.

"Hey guys, I've been really distant from people lately, friends and family and everyone really, I've just preferred to be by myself, apart from when I'm with my girlfriend but it's been like this for a few months now. I've gotten inconsistent with training and it's something that I'd usually never skip, I'm very passionate about and I have plenty of motivation for.

I don't want to ask people to diagnose me or anything like that, and I really don't want to come across like I think it's that easy to diagnose or anything, I just don't really want to talk to friends and people irl about it, I think I could be more honest here and I think people here could be more understanding and knowledgeable about everything tbh.

"So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried. Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. My psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but I've been putting off actually making the appointment because I'm scared. You know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty? It's sort of like that, except in reverse. I've had my depression for well over a decade, more than half my life, and I literally can't imagine what it'd be like if it actually got better. Would I still feel like me? I know that things would improve, obviously, but change is scary, and in a bizarre way, my depression is comfortable. It's been a constant for most of my life and I don't know who I'd be without it. TL;DR- I'm scared to try something that could work because I don't know who I'd be without my depression.",0,1,0,0,0,1

She was 13 when we met so she started kindergarten early and skipped a grade. then there's me who's two years older but nothing compared to her. She gets straight A's, takes all AP and honors classes, made VARSITY softball as a freshman (age of a 7th grader), got the lead roles in all the theatre shows, and just has a perfect life. Then there's me who doesn't have the best home life. I've tried telling her I can't sleep over because I need my meds and for other reasons. But then she just tells me ""oh everyone feels sad sometimes. You don't need those stupid pills."" Or if I tell her that it's my anxiety and ADHD pills she is like ""everyone has some form of ADHD. Have you seen everyone who can't pay attention? Those pills don't do anything"" I'm very reluctant to end our friendship because I don't have any other friends.

But i dont feel complete without the misery, i dont like to inflict it on others unlike people i know, i just dont feel like myself unless i‚Äôm depressed and suffering. I feel greedy if i‚Äôm not unhappy. I listen to everyone, but no one listens to me. When they do, i over do it because i guess i‚Äôm just selfish and thats all they see of me.

Has someone here survived an attempt or knows someone who did? I'd like to know how life looks like when you survive. How it's gonna impact social life (got no friends and family so probably not too much). How it impacts work and school (trying to graduate 2nd time. Dropped out cause of massive depressive episode and cause I got homeless). And just other things like are you put in therapy or even hospitalized and for how long. I'm in a situation where I just wish to die. But I can't kill myself cause I'm worried about what might happen if it fails or I somehow survive. Like how my life that's already the worst could get even worse then.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"holy shit things went bad fast. Last year I went into deep depression, however I recovered over the summer and things were seemingly looking up. I got a job, my grades were good and was hanging out with friends regularly. However the past two weeks things have went to absolute shit. My parents decided they wanted to try some ""parenting"" and decided I spent ""too much time on video games"". Even though I really only played 1-2 hours a night. It was one of the main ways I interacted with my friends as well. After that they decided that my phone was distracting me so it was confiscated as soon as I got home from school. Then they decided to take my door off the hinges to look in on me more. The worst part is i don't even know why they are doing all of this. My grades were good, A's and B's and in 6 AP classes while working 20 hours a week and maintaining a social life. Everything was going so good. Now I get home and feel empty and alone. I can't even cry in privacy. then they have the audacity to ask ""Honey whats wrong, why are you sad?????"". I just dont understand.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I got diagnosed with a pretty serious autoimmune disease about 5 months ago. The prognosis isn't great.

For those of y'all with chronic illness, how do you deal with the knowledge that things are only going to get worse? How can you maintain hope when there really isn't any reason to have it?

"Hey ya'll. Hope everyone is having a decent start to the new year.

I know it's not good for me (in more ways than one, IBS, depression, anxiety). But I have a really hard time stopping. When I do go for periods without drinking, I think I feel better. So I guess I just wanted to maybe hear from some people who successfully either cut back or cut down altogether, and how this has affected them. Also, if you have any tips, it'd be greatly appreciated. I almost feel like I'm addicted at this point.

"When my ego dies, will it take me with it? It's a selfish creature. It needs to be the best. It needs to be important. It needs people to agree with it. It throws tantrums. It lashes out when it's made to feel small. It thrives when it elevates itself above others. It thrives when it acts as if I am its personal chariot. It beats me down, demanding more than I could ever give. It piles on while I lie on the floor. It lives in a fantasy world full of delusion and self importance. But I withstand. I persist. It's all I know. It hurts. I suffer at its hands. I'm blinded. I was blinded. Now I see. Its time has passed. Once it goes, I can live without imagined fear. Once it's gone, I can truly live. Tonight I go deeper. Tonight it howls in pain. Only the void listens. Tonight I will cry, but I won't turn. Tonight is the night my ego will die. Putting you out of your misery.

"So I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now, and besides all the other upsides of therapy, I think my favorite and also most frustrating part is that my therapist confirmed that I am incredibly self-aware. To the point that she usually just agrees with me and I spend a lot of my sessions just talking to myself. Because I already know why my thoughts are irrational. I know I shouldn't let these things bother me. I know I'm not alone. I know this is an ongoing thing, I know, I know I know. And that's so frustrating. Because knowing doesnt make me feel any better. Knowing I need to learn how to like myself better and be okay to be alone doesnt help me actually get there. And when I get there, or think I've gotten there, I dont really feel any better. Yes, I'm lonely. I should learn to enjoy my own company and spend time with people who actually want to be with me. Great! Done that! Do this all the fucking time. But I feel the same. I'm still lonely. I still hate myself. Worst part is that I cant even blame anyone or anything. I did this. I'm doing this. I'm the problem. My therapist part of the problem is that I overthink and keep having these expectations for myself. That I should try to just ""do"" what feels right. But I already do that.

There‚Äôs only so much I can do in the day and it doesn‚Äôt help that I procrastinate. I have exams soon and I haven‚Äôt even started revising. I hate myself for being so lazy and idiotic. I just want to be at home. Or somewhere where I am surrounded my family and people I like. People who are on the same wavelength as me, who share my interests and have stuff in common. I have numerous days were I am happy but then I just get back home and feel so depressed because it was a one-off. Sometimes I just have these thoughts where I think that death would get rid of everything. Sometimes I wonder if anyone would care if I died. Though I don‚Äôt want to carry out these thoughts, but these thoughts are often. I just don‚Äôt want to be alone anymore, and I don‚Äôt know what to do.",0,1,1,1,0,0

"Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out. I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug?

Life has evolved over millions of years to adapt to anything that mother nature threw at us, and here we are, humans, in all our glory and achievements, still scaling new heights. What do we live for? Different individuals will give you different answers, but the top dogs in history came into power for reasons that boils down to one thing, immortality. And no, not literal immortality, rather, to immortalize their name in the books after they've passed on. We all fear death, but what we fear more is to be completely forgotten. If that is the case, then our rat race, arms race and hardwork all comes to naught in the face of entropy. It's far from now, astronomically far, but know that the universe will tear itself apart one day, not even subatomic particles will be there. This, this is a fate worse than death. All life, heck, even inorganic matter will be pulled apart. So why are we trying so hard to leave a mark in history if nothing matters in the end? Love, life, hope, dreams... It all doesn't matter. No wonder people want to believe in religion, to escape thos nihilistic despair. But hey, this is just science, and science is as good as human ingenuity and observation.

This grew into anger and hatred for non-original thought. I see it as people thinking that they say original things, but in my mind, it makes me extremely frustrated. A little while ago, I started watching anime, primarily moe content. This woke something in me, and it wasn't good. It left me with very high standards and expectations of females, both physically and in terms of personality. Lately I've been seeing all girls around me as unimpressive, and I desire something more. At this point, I was on the verge of depression. I'm seeing everyone as inferior and not worth spending time with. This is strange for me, because for my whole life I've loved others and felt extreme empathy and compassion for everyone. So here I am, with high standards, irritable, possibly depressed, lonely, confused and wrathful. Now, another unreasonable standard in finding a female my age (16) approaches.

Anyway, my way of coping with all of this is to put myself in danger and make myself feel physically bad in the hope I will feel more valid in my suffering and that I will finally be able to ask for help and feel like I deserve it. Does someone else feel this way here ? Thank you for reading my messages, and sorry for my english.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"I've already had a lot going on in my personal life, and I was closer to suicide than I'd ever been. Then there was a huge argument among my friends. I won't get into details, but I don't think they'll make up. I was right in the middle and now I need to fucking pick a side. But I don't want to pick a side. If I do I'll lose some of my friends, and I am neutral on the whole situation anyway. If I don't pick a side, I'll start spending more time with one group than the other because I hate changing things, and then they'll hate me. So I'm going to isolate. I won't sit with them in the morning or at lunch, I'll only work with them in class if they come to me, etc. If they want to talk to me they'll find me. I don't have any other friends, so I'll be completely alone. Of course, that'll only happen if I don't end up killing myself before the end of March break. I was so close to suicide before the argument, but now I'm pushed past my limit. I'll probably go for the next opportunity I get (i.e. know I'll be home alone for 2+ hours). I just can't take this anymore, it's all become too much. I don't really want to die, but nothing ever gets better so what's the point. I just give up.",0,0,0,1,0,0

The second time was at a hospital and I was placed on suicide watch. Needless to say, my parents were/are scared ASF. I use drugs to cope. Weed, Adderall, lean, alcohol, Xanax, Ambien, and LSD.

"Hey guys, I'm hoping someone could shed some light on a situation for me. I have been diagnosed with major depression disorder and an anxiety disorder. I have been suffering from.bith severe depression and severe anxiety for about 9 months and after trying numerous things to resolve it (including self medicating) I had finally decided to give medication a try. At first I was put on citalopram, this caused many severe side effects like increased anxiety, insomnia, constantly sweating, nausea, dry mouth etc. But I had a period where for 2 days I had worsening of depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and very impulsive - like - uncontrollable anxiety (with constant shaking for 2 days straight). I visited my doctor as this frightened me and immediately switched my medication to effexor.

I of course didn't bring this up to my doctor and I am now wondering is it possible that the drugs used to self medicate might be causing alternative effects with the antidepressants?

"2016 was probably one of the most difficult years with my depression and I think a big reason for that is because I let it. I pushed people away, not because I wanted to be alone, but because it was less exhausting than going out and doing stuff. I waited way to long to go back to my therapist and it just continued to snowball to the point that I felt there was no way out of it. I've recently taken a big step towards improving my well being and I am hoping that this will make 2017 a little more bearable. This step, being medication, has been something I've been reluctant to take as I felt like a failure.

I still fall for the player saying he wants something more than hooking up just to be used, ghosted, and hit up when he is drunk and horny. The first few times hurt my ego but I recovered.

Talk with a guy about life and get to know each other. But. The only attention I ever get are if I post naughty pics or nudes. Once I show and indication that I'm human they ghost.

No one invited me anywhere and I don't blame them. I'm not angry that he went, I am angry at myself. I have no friends, live miles away from any family and at the age of almost 28 have nothing to live for. I try to stay upbeat but I really don't see the point. I've alienated myself from everyone and this is what I get. I just want it all to be over.",0,0,0,1,0,0

"I find myself frequenting this sub a lot, usual late at night listening to some music. The problem is personally I do not suffer from any sort of depression. In fact I'm glad that I consider my life is pretty decent, albeit with a few shortcomings. Being the start of a new year I see many posts here talking about self improvement and finally fighting the problems that have been plaguing some people for years. I've come to say that you all can do it, everyone of you can achieve and be something greater. It may seem like it's impossible for some, but life is a hard, hard road. You don't have to be depressed to know life is quite the bitch and throws you around all the time. But having the strength to keep going and fighting for yourself is what keeps us all here. The fact all of you are here is a miracle in itself, and while many people may see it as more of a curse than a blessing, just know that life has strange ways of working, and everyone here has the ability to live up to what they want to be It may not seem like it right now, hell it may not feel like it a few years from now, but just always know that your life is important, you matter, to all of us, but more importantly, you matter to yourself.",0,0,0,1,0,0

"I am a weak and small person that know one respects. I am treated like shit and abandon by society. I am aggressive to people. I think about murdering and killing others. I take out rage on myself and pretend to slaughter the people that constantly disrespect and hurt me. I like the grey sky that gives the depressing tone. I like gore and violence and doing things that I find somewhat happiness towards but I fall into this void of grief and sorrow. I am a hopeless one. I am loading the bullet and not caring for what anyone thinks. I don't care for life anymore. I am accepting my fate.

Cold and sad makes me feel happy. I have lost interest in friends, activities and prefer to be alone. I am a sad and pathetic human being and wanted to say goodbye to the ones I cared about which is practically 0. I am a loser that hangs myself with a guitar string and is bullied daily.

"Ive been on Viibryd for about a year give or take. The first few months I gained about 20lbs and all together ive gained 25lbs( last I knew.) I stopped weighing myself about 2 months ago because it was getting even more depressing. I've read a few forums and have noticed that most people have experienced rapid weight gain with this medication, and no matter how hard they've worked- the weight wont budge. same issue here. I'm ready to ditch this medication because 1. I'm sick of dealing with the weight gain, going to the gym 3-6 times a week has done nothing. 2. it seems to increase my anxiety at times. 3.Its expensive(even with a coupon code and insurance.) The thing is- I'm VERY scared as I know that depression can become harder to treat over time. I tried probably about 8 medications before I found this one- I really thought there was no hope beforehand. I've stuck it out because obviously mental health is more important that weight gain, but the weight gain is causing me to obsess over what I eat/how often I workout. Does anyone currently take viibryd? Have you even come off of it, what was it like? I heard the withdrawals are horrible.",0,1,0,0,0,1

I think that people who are depressed can be grouped into two general categories. Those who have been unfortunately mentally wired wrong and those who have experienced some awful trauma or emotional pain. I'm sure for many on this sub it is both. For me it is both. And because of this fact I am uncertain if I can ever recover. I feel as though it is inevitable that I will kill myself. There is a part of me that really doesn't want to; i'm scared. But there are also times that I feel so badly and I just want it to end. Has anyone out there found anything that's helped them? Right now I just don't know what to do.,0,1,0,1,0,1

Their relationship is long-distance and when he's with his boyfriend he barely texts me. I tried distancing myself, but he's scared he's gonna lose me so he doesn't give me a lot of space.

"Like right now, I just got up. I need to feed my pets, clean the litter box, brush my teeth, start some laundry, and eat something. It feels like too much. I'm so anxious right now, and I just want to go back to bed and shut down. I don't care about today. I don't want it. But if I get it all done, I'll probably feel okay. That's not the case every day, but today I feel like I could get to a good place if I try. But then what? Tomorrow starts the same way. Too much to do. Everything's too hard and I feel sh!tty. Until I get some things done and the weight is lifted. Heck, even two hours from now I'll be in the same boat. There's always stuff to do. I need to clean the house, make some phone calls, shovel snow, get dressed, eat again. It never stops. And sometimes I can feel good when I've gotten somewhat on top of things, but what's the point? It's like an endless wild goose chase. Shouldn't I be able to just feel good, regardless of the conditions around me or what's on my to-do list? Also, this is just basic stuff. I don't have any kids, relationships to manage, projects or hobbies, and only about 20 hours of work a week. I'm just trying to keep myself and my animals from starving or dying from poverty, filth, or negligence. And it's so hard.

"I invited my friend Ryan to brunch yesterday since it had been a while since I saw him and I wanted to catch up. He is 16 and a junior in high school; I'm 17 and a senior in high school. Things were going great until he suggested we go hang out at my house. I drove him over and we went into my room. There was only one chair at my desk seeing as I'm usually the only one in my room so he sat on my lap - he is bi and I am gay so we're both ok with that. Then I started to go for his crotch and he told me to knock it off. I stopped for a while but then I went back in again, eventually getting all the way under his pants. A few minutes later he mentioned he had plans so I drove him back to his house and we went our separate ways. I just can't fathom how I could possibly do something like that. It was like my hormones just completely controlled me and my brain just turned off. What kind of person attacks their friend like that? And to top it off, I knew he had feelings for a girl at the time so i probably just fucked up their relationship. What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't normally have a high sex drive either. I feel so scared and guilty and I just want him to be OK. I don't give a shit about myself anymore. Now I understand why people self harm.",0,0,0,1,0,1

"I'm a 38(m), and I've been taking Cymbalta for a little over a year. About 2 months ago, I started feeling very depressed again for no reason, and having bouts of extreme anger. I informed my doc, and she doubled my dose to 60mg. Since then, my depression and anger have gotten much much worse. My life is amazing right now. I have a wife who loves me and supports me through all of my depression and anxiety issues. She is learning how to talk me down off the cliff sometimes, but it is a crapshoot as to whether she is able to or not. I have two wonderful little girls, who bring me so much joy. Yesterday, I had a terrible day all day. I can't get motivated to do what I need to do at work, and when I do, I have terrible anxiety that I'm going to fuck something up and get fired. I spent most of the day yesterday shaking at my desk, because I couldn't even make myself move half the time. I got home, and had a fight with my wife, because I was taking everything she said the wrong way, to the point that I eventually just broke down crying for NO REASON. I cried for probably 45 minutes over nothing. These episodes are happening more and more frequently. The last time I remember feeling this way was when I got the bright idea to stop taking my Cymbalta completely, and that was an unmitigated DISASTER. I had a complete breakdown, and nearly left my entire family. I'm terrified that if Cymbalta has indeed stopped working for me that I'm going to have to stop taking it, and will end up having another breakdown. I absolutely hate my brain...",0,1,0,1,1,0

The people who were closest to the deceased are not here to console you. Life is not about you. It is about the people who surround you.

Still trying to figure out the logistics of when my first appointment will be with the doctor but I‚Äôm proud I am taking a step in the right direction. I think my slide into depression the last 6 months is from the loss of my dad as well as some other personal issues (hated my job/fallout with some friends/bad breakup) but it took 6+ months after all that for me to finally realize I needed help. I was sleeping in, just watching tv/playing Xbox and avoiding my friends at times when I started to feel anxious. I started becoming more and more of a recluse but at this point I‚Äôm done with this feeling. I have gotten a new job and mentioned to my boss that I might need to show up an hour late on Fridays for my therapy. She couldn‚Äôt have been more understanding and supportive of it.

"What I mean by this, is that they care to hear how you're doing and stuff, and they do care of your existence. For example, if you fall ill, they may say something like ""Well, I hope ____ feels better soon!"" That kind of thing. But a lot of people don't care about you, they care *of* you. If they aren't the kind of person who talks and listens to you, then I feel like that means they only care of you.

No one in my family knows. The days I wake up so late because it's impossible to wake up. All the student loan debt that is creeping on my back and I still haven't graduated yet.

"I‚Äôm 16 I‚Äôve been severely suicidal since I was 10. When I was around 11 I slit my wrists and my parents walked in when I was bleeding out. They said they were ‚Äòbusy‚Äô working and gave me antiseptic cream and bandaids instead of taking me to the hospital my dad walked in later that night and cried over me and basically called me selfish. No one ever talked about it again and I never received help. I‚Äôm now in 11th grade and school has never been worse I‚Äôve already had 2 pretty serious breakdowns and I‚Äôm only 6 weeks in. Through extensive online research I found some ‚Äòpainless‚Äô suicide methods and purchased the drugs and blades necessary to pull it off. I almost did it the other night but I want to finalise some things first. My mum is gone so just now I went to my dad for a final plea for help and when I told him he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs all in your head‚Äù ‚Äú the only thing you have is self pity‚Äù etc. I just know I‚Äôm going to end it all pretty soon, I‚Äôm not sure when but almost definitely soon.

"Let me start off by saying that I wasn't always this way. I used to be an advanced student in elementary school and had a passion for reading and learning; I could absorb knowledge and I had a social life. Then, things took a drastic change in 5th grade for no obvious reason. I suddenly felt tired all the time; as if I didn't sleep enough. All I could think was ""why am I so tired? I'll sleep more tonight"" every day. For the first time in my life, I failed a test. I broke down in tears in the middle of class and was surrounded in anxiety and depression. I also somehow ""obtained"" adhd/extreme forgetfulness and started losing my ability to properly comprehend people speaking to me and use my mind's eye to visualize anything... I was uninhibited in many social situations (my best friend's mom thought I was using drugs before I even knew what a marijuana was) and extremely anxious in others. Stimulants didn't help much besides giving me energy and although anti-depressants help with my mood, all the other symptoms remain. I have a feeling that this is a brain tumor or brain damage because of how it affects me so broadly. I've never had suicidal thoughts and honestly, I don't think too much at all. Nothing crisp, anyways. I'm 19 now and not sure where to proceed from here. My mom believes it's because I became an atheist and my dad thinks it's because I just don't care. Professionals (doctors, therapists, psychiatrists) don't seem to know what's going on with me. My thyroid and bloodwork is fine and I got a sleep study done. Should I see a neurologist or another specialist?",1,1,1,1,0,1

"I'm not a believer of anything spiritual or supernatural, but it truly does feel like I was cursed with bad luck or some shit. A lot of it is just small things. Constantly getting the worst loot in video games, missing the public bus by like 30 seconds, etc. I always make small personal bets with myself like if I get a notification on Instagram I'll just be like ""I bet this specific person didn't like this post"" and I look at the notification and it's exactly that. This kind of shit is constantly happening everyday. By themselves it's not bad at all, but it really builds up and starts eating away at you. And then there's bigger things. Like being 5'2 as a male is pretty bad. I have mental illnesses and some of it I can't even relate with other mentally ill people. I get bronchitis like every fucking year. And then tonight, I just got news that a field trip to Hawaii that I've been looking forward to for FOUR FUCKING YEARS has been cancelled because of the coronavirus bullshit. Of course it had to be the ONE FUCKING YEAR IM A SENIOR AND ABLE TO GO. It just all piles up so fucking much. I feel like I'll just constantly have bad luck in life. It makes me lose excitement in things I'm actually excited for because I'm just in that mindset that it'll go wrong because of my bad luck.

"So I guess I could start by saying I know people out there have it worse than me, and maybe constant suffering is really worse, but I can't stand going back and forth. Good days, awesome days, absolute shit days, mediocre days, ad nauseum. I'll even go from a decent day like today to shit. Really the back and forth has made me realize how shitty the shit really is. It gives me perspective. You could say that is true of the opposite, but all I can think is that the good is amazing, but temporary, always temporary. Seeing that distinction is driving me mad, and I don't believe I have anyone to go to about this. I've tried with several people, and I don't get anything. Always sinking back into that realization that the few people in my life have shown themselves to not give a shit is so, so depressing. My happy days are the days I live for myself and forget about my relationships with other people, but that's an impossible life to live permanently because we all have relationships whether we want them or not. If I were to contact all the people in my life and tell them I'm going to kill myself, they would be concerned, take the necessary steps to stop me from killing myself, then go back to their lives. This is sort of a tangent, but I'm starting to simply feel like a pawn in other people's lives. Now that I am a part of some people's emotional landscape that they want to keep intact, I can't go. Fuck that.",1,0,0,1,0,0

I have had CBT and counseling in the past but just nothing seems to work and it's all too much for me to cope with. I've spent the majority of today researching suicide methods because I just can't cope anymore. I'm sorry for posting but I just don't know what to do.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"Just wondering if anyone is having the same problem as I. I am struggling for about 3 years now and I am not getting better anytime soon. Im getting sick of the job that I am doing, although I am good at it but it doesn't mean that it is what I want to do for the rest of my working life. The problem is I cant seem to stay at this type of job for more than a year. Ive been with 4 companies already within that span of 3 years. Plus I am losing my will to even work because Im about to lose my son, my partner and I had this stupid fight and decided to cut my ties between them. I am so lost right now and I cant sleep most of the time. I dont know what to do. Problems keep on adding and adding up. I need some advices to keep me sane.

"So, been a long time since I posted (used throwaway but now I don't care) Basically, I was really depressed, I self harmed and attempted suicide once. After a while I decided I needed some company so I got a girlfriend. That in itself is an issue so I'll summarize it. She and I were happy but she said she was still in love with her ex. Thats when I realized I wasn't really happy with her. I broke up with her and was genuinely happy. This was about a mont and a half ago. Depression was gone and I was the best I could be. Then my friends started saying shit behind my back, that I was a fake and didn't have individuality. Basically mean things. Besides my friends were still (and still are) best friends with my ex. Like all of them.I started becoming left out. they stopped talking to me. (Literally the only chat I have with another person is my one true friend (Who doesn't respond to any of my messages even though he talks in groups) the rest I haven't had a chat since beginning of december) I keep telling myself that its okey. That I don't need them. I am probably right, But it feels really shitty. And to top it all of, my depression is coming back. I can feel it creeping up.

I don't really know where to begin but suicide is something I have been thinking about constantly. I don't want to wake up, I don't want to be anywhere or with anyone, and I don't even want to sleep anymore and that's the only thing that would numb my depression (because I wasn't awake to feel it). I feel so incredibly lost and I can't help but to want so badly to end it all. I keep wishing something would push me over the edge enough to give me the strength to finally kill myself. Everything's just so dark and honestly I could go on forever but my brother-in-law just walked in and I have to pretend like I'm okay again so I guess I'll stop there. I'd just really like to hear the thoughts others have, if this resonates with them, and maybe some suggestions on how to finally let go and give myself that peace in ending everything.",0,0,0,1,0,1

I'm not even depressed now I am just at the point that I don't care anymore. So now I have gone in one year from being kind of cool with everyone then being really awesome and fun and everybody liked me and I was invited to everything to now not being invited to anything and none of the people that were my friends caring to ask me to hang out.

"Okay everyone hello there, recently I've been having extreme panic attacks and depression. It all started with me crying imagining what would happen to me if my parents died on public transport. My mum instantly comforted me and told me that wouldn't happen (I'm 13). I continued on to yesterday which as you all know is New year's. I started getting even more panicky thinking about what happens after life and that if I die is that it? I solved that by reading some theories on after life and forming my opinion that we go into a sort of lounge with the spirits who wait for us. After that I've lost all ambition to become an entrepreneur and just thinking of what point is there to life. I've been able to get myself out of the panicky state only when watching youtube or playing video games. Any other time I end up being highly stressed for some unknown reason.

It feels like society tells everyone that it is their fault if they make a bad decision, that they are responsible for their choices, and most dont understand mental illness properly and to me its not that black and white. I want to know whether you think you truly have the capacity to be at fault for a decision youve made if it is something you would not have done outside an acute depressive episode.

The four abilities: Understanding Appreciating Reasoning Ability to express a choice Now I cant say I know the exact ways to interpet these 4 things right now without further research but, do you feel you possess these abilities during a severe depressive episode? Do you possess some and not others? Does it vary? My answer would be during a severe depressive episode, I do not possess any of these reliably at every moment.

The day they divorced, police had to come to the house because my dad was trying to hurt my mom. Soon after I witnessed my younger brother change from an innocent child to a drug addict.

"I am so sick of being depressed. When I was a kid, I was happy and never let anything keep me down. When there was a problem, I solved it, simple as that. Now I get depressed and contemplate suicide. I can't take it anymore; I am so sick of being disappointed in myself. I'm sick of always being too afraid to act. Maybe I am a failure and maybe I never will amount to anything, but how will I know if I never try or believe in myself. I will use my nihilism to succeed and be happy. This is the only life I've got, and someday I'll be dead and forgotten. So why waste it being sad. No longer will I romanticize my depression and let it get the better of me.

"warning: fairly negative post. Feeling lonely &amp; not having friends used to bother me a lot. I thought having people reaching out &amp; caring about me would help me feel better about life. Then I started a program in college where everyone is really ""tight"" with each other. So now I'm not totally isolated like going weeks without talking to people, like it was before. These people are nice, fun &amp; share the same interests as me. There's no reason I couldn't be friends with them. But these relationships don't make me not want to erase my existence anymore, or pull me out of a shell, more confident, cheerful every once in a while, ad nauseum. It's not that they're ""not enough"" or something, it's just that nothing can fix me. I guess this past year has really proven that to me. That element of ""I wish ____ would just contact me, it would prove I'm not worthless and someone cares"" is gone, and it's honestly a relief. Kind of like sinking into a somewhat comfortable void. But it definitely scares me for the years to come. I'm supposed to live for 60+ more years like this? I'd rather not.",0,0,1,1,0,0

It is now at the lowest point and she has tried multiple times to commit suicide. She had health insurance for when she had her double mastectomy early in 2016 but my father quit paying for it.

"I've always loved helping others, whether it means I'm there to talk to them and listen to their concerns, or doing something for them. It makes me feel like I'm contributing something to society, and it is especially rewarding to see when I've helped make their day better somehow. However, lately I've been feeling this is my only good quality, being a utility to others. People only keep me around and talk to me because they know I would always agree to helping them out. They tolerate all my other horrible qualities because the help is worth more to them. Recently, I sent an email to my boss (who I'm pretty close with) with an organized spreadsheet for a work task (something I had not been asked to do, and was my boss's job), and they replied telling me ""You're amazing! Thanks for making everything so organized for me. You are such a gem"". Comments that like sting for me rather than lift me up because they just further validate my belief that I am only a utility to others, and that if I weren't useful, they would ice me out in a second. I still try to do helpful things for others, but lately it's made me feel more horrible than good.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Hi, First post on this sub in a while but I'm at a loss of what to do I'm so fed up of feeling numb and tired and like I don't want to exist and my brain is so fogged that I cant think straight I'm trying everything - taking the pills, doing the therapy, seeking advice and just nothing seems to be helping I don't like my job, but I also don't want to resign without anything else lined up and all of the experts and forums and advice systems just suggest trying to 'think in a more positive manner' and I'm really trying but it just feels hopeless, I get 5 minutes of 'maybe this will be OK!' then immediately back to the grey reality I've started applying for new jobs as my current manager has suggested that we get through year end then if I'm still feeling the same way then perhaps I should look elsewhere so I kind of don't see the point in actually trying until year end as if I'm not staying then who am I impressing?

"When daydreaming my mind brings up negative memories. In any situation, in any location my mind will simply wander and bring up pessimistic memories instantly. I'll often be left pondering ""why did I do that?"" - ""why did I say that?"". These will often be memories or sort of quick snapshots of uneasy moments in my life that will flash through my psyche as soon as I have a spare moment. It's happened on the train, when at work and socialising with friends. The odd thing is that the memories vary in date - it could be something I said last week, to something I did at a party when I was like five years old. The underlying factor is that all of these memories will have negative associations and will leave me questioning my actions, thoughts and responses at the time. It seems as though I have no control over what memories or images appear - I have been overheard saying ""How can I even remember that!"" when peculiar or seemingly distant images re-appear.

"I remember the first time I ever had suicidal thoughts, it was 4 years ago and I was living away from home for university. I remember coming home that weekend and breaking down in front of my parents straight away. That experience was horrifying especially because the thoughts were really severe and that was the start of me being depressed. Now, 4 years later I have periods of severe depression where these thoughts come up again. However, now whenever I get these thoughts I am able to keep them to myself for an extended period of time and just carry on as normal. A major difference between then and now is that I actually want to die now whereas before that thought was completely alien to me. My desire to die is pretty strong right now mainly because I am scared about the new year and the last few months have gone really shit. I love my family so much but I feel like my anxiety and depression is going to win very soon. I was thinking of going to my old therapist and showing her my diary with all of my suicidal thoughts with the intention of getting hospitalised but that comes across like attention seeking and that I don't really have a desire to die. Part of me doesn't want to go and show it to her but then another part really does. She is the only one I would show this to.

People I try to talk to at school just ignore me or talk to my so called friends around me who also ignored me, and it just makes me filled with rage, sadness, and envy. I helped those people in the past and they don't repay me back. I sit alone at lunch, and basically just a loner in general. My family doesn't know I have depression and I don't want to tell them because it will make them sad and I love them.I will probably kill myself later this year, or during the school year and see how much they care.( Probly won't), but hey, at least I'm passing my classing with a, and b's. All I'm asking for is friendship or just to be happy, or at least an aquatience. I have to go to school in a little but I haven't gone to sleep. Well fuck me, I guest I'm just a boring, ugly, stupid person. Probably will just stay in sick I guess. 1. Today I went to school and finally made it to the 24 hour mark of staying awake. I talked to some people in my 7th period and I actually had a good conversation today with a actual human being , hahah. Well finally things are going well, I hope soo. Thank you for the support very much! I do appreciate.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I don't understand. I keep on living my normal life that I've been living for the past 16 years. I'm not being an asshole to anyone as far as I am concerned but still for the past 2 months pretty much everyone has begun to hate me. My parents and brothers talk shit about right in front of me. They bully me. My friends left me after I told one of them that I go to therapy. This isn't helping my condition at all. I am not sure whether to commit suicide or not.,0,0,0,1,0,0

"Hey everyone, This is so weird that a Reddit board exists for this, but hey it does. I'm a 31 year old, who generally has a lot going for him on paper (good job, partner, lots of friends, supportive family, health, etc). With the job, there is one caveat, I don't know what I'm doing. For context purposes, I'm an accountant and have been one for almost a decade now. I was the kid who studied his butt off in school with the expectation that would pay off in the form of a good job, success etc. I was also one of those people that thought he was better than others, where deep down I wasn't. Really, everybody is special and unique in their own ways. Anyways, what I'm getting at is I feel I've put a lot of bad energy out there and it's all culminating into one big disaster over the past few months. That disaster being the realization that the skills that I say I have on paper I don't actually have in real life (somehow miraculously I got by the past 10 years) and now I don't know what to do. Over the past few months I haven't been sleeping, barely getting anything done at work and overall feel like the end is near. I've had suicide ideation since I was a 15 coupled with worrying about death in general. Anyways, not sure what I expect to get out of posting this, but just wanted to share my situation. I do want to live deep down, there are just so many uncertainties and realizations about myself that scare the living shit out of me.",0,0,0,0,1,0

"For some of us, 2017 sucked. Relationships, friends (or lack of), grades, lost loved ones - whatever it may be, maybe this year was garbage. Personally (22/M), I just spent my fifth consecutive New Years alone - sitting here wondering why I'm still incapable of making any notable friendships at what some people consider to be the best/easiest age to socialize and make friends. Despite that, I'm convinced that sitting here listening to the fireworks alone isn't all that life has to offer - and maybe a change in attitude/habits will help me next year. By extension, I sincerely hope everyone reading this will have a better 2018 in whatever aspect of life is holding you down.

"I'm 30 and have been depressed since 15, the age at which I realized I wasn't going to be tall and handsome and gave up on life. I get worse whenever I see porn, since I chastise myself for not having the genetics to date and bang hot women. I asked an aesthetics forum to rate pictures of me, they said 6-7, but it means almost nothing to me if it's not 9. The one thing that keeps me from killing myself is thinking about how I could change my life around. I'm currently selling my stuff so I can afford lasik, then braces to fix my teeth. I'd also love to get limb lengthening on my legs by 3"" to make me about 6', but I have a small head and worry that I won't look good. I've done research on how to apply for gene therapy clinical trials and other radical reconstruction. I honestly don't care what the complications would be, I'm THAT unhappy. I think about suicide already, and I would end it if it happened to not work out. I wasted a lot of time before realizing this ""my way or bust"" mindset, and I hope anyone younger than me can take away that you'll regret not solving your problems sooner if you don't start now.

"Hey everyone! Quick little backstory: I am 22 years old and have suffered from depression since I was around age 14. During that time I took Zoloft with a Xanax PRN for panic attacks. Earlier this year (around May 2017) my primary doctor upped my dosage by 50mg, I was then taking 150mg. My body adjusted to the increase and I hated how it made me feel. I felt worse than before. As if it worsened my symptoms. So, full well knowing the dangers of stopping a medication like Zoloft, I stopped taking it around the end of July 2017. At first I was fine. Them a month had gone by and I was bad. Then a few months later (Nov 2017) I was the worst I had ever been in my life. I lost 20lbs from Thanksgiving to now... I don't have an appetite, even though I feel hungry all the time. I have extreme fatigue. I am always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I am stressed because student loans kick in this month ($515 a month), and I cannot afford to visit my family doctor because of $ I owe from previous visits. Is this 20lb sudden weight loss something that can be attributed to depression? I am generally a very healthy person. I workout daily, but haven't been able to the past month because of my extreme fatigue and depression. That's why it confuses me as to why I've lost weight. I am 22, female, athletic build, 6'0"" and 178lbs. Sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit. If it is, please direct me elsewhere. Thank you guys for your time. ‚ù§",0,1,1,0,1,0

"Hi guys, long time reader first time poster here. A year ago I moved into an apartment in a brand new city. I remember being so excited for all the things I'd be able to do. I'd get a job, get to a gym membership, and even join a few social groups. Well, after a year, nothings really changed. I applied for a lot of jobs and ended up going to a decent number of interviews. Nothing ever came of them and after June passed me by I lost my nerve to even really look anymore. I did end up getting a gym membership but I've never really used it though. I know I shouldn't procrastinate like this but I'm never able to find the energy. I haven't been able to find any groups or friends while I've been here either. I've looked but the only groups I've been able to find have been smaller groups that cater to people a lot older than I am. It's been getting harder and harder to find motivation to get out of bed or go outside for a long time now. As I don't have a car, I'd have to take the bus to go anywhere which would eat up most of my day. I haven't really been able to derive any sense or pleasure from much anything these days. I'm just letting the time pass. Next week, I'm starting university and I'd like to enjoy this time of my life.

Quick background... 4 year relationship ended about two months ago. Madly depressed because of it. Irresponsible of me to say that I was not taking my antidepressants until recently.

All she told me was to tell my mom how I was feeling and go see a doctor. That is the hardest thing I can possibly do.

It was a move we both definitely wanted and I have no regrets at all from that - however it's again where I think my resilience decided to leave me.

"I had an open cosmetic rhinoplasty 4 months ago and since then I've been experiencing symptoms that have been fairly debilitating for me. A few weeks post-op I noticed that my air flow was different in each nostril and there was a slight pain in my left but I chalked it up to swelling. Now, 4 months later there is no more pain but I feel like there is a blockage in my left nostril and I can't sense airflow at all in either nostril which is keeping me up at night. I'm on sleeping pills which is barely helping me get a few hours throughout the night. I'm really scared and did not expect to go through this scary journey - all I wanted was a refinement.

Our whole friend group was separated into different classes and we all didn't hang out that much anymore outside of school. At the end of the year I found out that my 2 best friends were switching schools, one for personal reasons and one for sports reasons. When I found out I was devastated and wanted to switch schools for next year also. I looked at the school one of my friends was going to and liked it, so I switched to that school. Ever since then it seems my life is going downhill. I have a few close friends but we rarely hang out or text. I don't understand how they can handle not seeing their friends outside of school. My best friend lives in another town, so we never hang out, and my other couple friends live in the country far away from the subdivision I live in. In our classes there is also a huge gender divide, so chances are I will never have a girlfriend through high school.

I loved her so much I had never felt so safe and happy or secure in my life until I was with her and I believed she was the most amazing woman I would ever meet or had ever met.

"Ok so while this is definitely not my first time going to counseling, this was the first meeting with a new counsellor. It was set up through my work's EAP service, which I've used before with limited success. Anyway, I had my first session this week and it was weird. First of all, it was in a very unconventional location. It was in an office (I mean literally a room with a desk and some office chairs), inside an organization not typically known for mental health services. So that was weird and it took me a while to get comfortable enough to start talking. Since this was the first session, most of it was just me explaining what was going on in my life and why I'm there. Anyway, near the end she remarked that I was a fascinating person and she really wants to talk to me more. That's my first time hearing that, especially from a professional. Then she asked me if I was familiar with the mbti, to which I replied I am not a fan. She also suggested I check out metaphysics because it might help me or something. I Dunno , I walked out of there feeling strange. On one hand, the counselor was nice and all, but on the other hand, certain things made me a bit uncomfortable.

"Hi all, A friend of mine has gone down a depression spiral over the past year and 1/2. She has seen psychologists and psychiatrists and the only thing they seem to help with is medication. She has refused to take the medication properly. She started but stopped after feeling terrible. She will make plans and then cancel them because of her panic attacks. They happen daily at specific times, she has one at 7am daily. They will also occur intermittently throughout the day and which point she will be unable to do anything but runaway and be alone, presumably. She cannot work, remember things consistently, or think. She has attempted to jump out of a moving vehicle. Friends and family have all come to her aid but she essentially refuses any kind of answer because they do not solve her issues. I'm not sure there is a correct answer. The biggest source of sadness for her is her age, coupled with where she is in life. She has spent the past 4 years in a masters program for biology that most likely will not amount to a job. She feels as if she wasted her time and will have nothing to show for it. I have suggested changing fields but she doesn't have the financial resources to do so comfortably. She is also engaged and doesnt not feel comfortable relying on her fiance for money. She doesn't make a lot of money, so paying for therapy isn't an option, really. I'm just a friend, but I feel helpless that I cannot help her. She has attempted to hurt herself, so I want to do whatever I can or at least be helpful in some way. Any suggestions would be helpful.",0,1,0,0,1,1

It's also possible that I have a rare genetic disease (Which is being looked into) that causes atypical mental functioning, Is there any hope or should I just fucking end it? I'm so done now. Am I just too stupid to survive in this world? There is so much I am ignorant on regarding ""real world"" practicalities and even other aspects such as politics and history?

For example, I assume that I'm going to suck at a job and never get promoted, so I don't try hard because I view the effort as futile. The prediction therefore fulfills itself.

This year has been complete hell for me I turned 22 I lost my girlfriend of 4 years she broke up with me by handing me the custom necklace I got her.. I fell thousands of dollars in debt from helping her with everything she needed from phones to car payments. I met my best friend fell completely in love with her thought she felt the same way so I asked her out she turned me down. everything was fine (I just loved her company) until 2 weeks ago she started dating and I never really see her anymore and is now about to move away.... I'm stuck living with my parents who tell me how everything I do is wrong how I should have a 50k+ income how I should have moved out 2 years ago becomes it's easy to afford to live. I can't afford to move out alone I truly thought she loved me and we were simply going to get a apartment we even talked about it a lot to the point we looked at some.. I'm ending 2016 thousands in debt alone and depressed knowing there will never be anyone there for me when I need them my few friends I consider family and I would do anything for them (from buying tires to food to giving them a ride) and I like to think that they would be there for me... but this year has shown me that's not the case that non of them truly care about me...

Since then I've had about 6 months of time to really digest my thoughts and feeling. I feel an incredible depression each day and then feel even worse when I think about my children having to deal with my death. For a long time that deterred me from suicide, now it seems more like a valid solution to my pain and a way for everyone to move on. I dont want anyone to find my body which clearly describes suicide. On the contrary I'd like to frame my death so the narrative suggests a noble death and therefore easier on my family. Of course my children love me, but it's been an incredibly long time since I've felt love or purpose. I feel like a paycheck, a slave to everyone else's needs, a pawn in someone else's game. I'm happy that I experienced love, excitement, danger, success but I feel now at the age of 35 the good days of ignorant bliss are behind me.

I have a body focused repetitive disorder that popped up around early high school and has since been a lot better. I've always been a bit on the depressed side since middle school with low self esteem.

He thinks of them as tantrums and doesn't know how to deal with or help with them. Even at home, when I think too much I focus on all the bad and this happens again. I start doubting my relationship because of all the bad stuff, I start feeling bad about my life etc. For the most part I really like my relationship.

"That's it. This isn't a new year's resolution because that shit is nonsense people tell themselves to feel better. I'm GOING to beat this shit. The last month I can confidently say has been THE WORST month of my life and I have been through A LOT OF SHIT during the last 27 years of my existence. At least during those times, I wasn't depressed (somehow). I know what I need to do. I need to find a therapist who understands what I'm going through.

Just because I happened to enter at the same time as some other older students who didn‚Äôt belong there. When I left the college, no one noticed. It is probably a matter of weeks or even days before I take my life. Nothing is worth it. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing can save me now. Nothing. And what‚Äôs more, no one (apart from probably my mother and sister) won‚Äôt miss me. But let‚Äôs be serious, they‚Äôll live without me. And also, I‚Äôm sure no one will notice this post, in the heap of posts of people with more serious life issues. This is really what makes me a failure: not being able to live happily in a life which would seem ok to most people here. So yeah.",0,0,1,0,1,0

"I guess I'll start off by saying that I've been dealing with depression about eight years. It has peaked in the past, but I'd say I've been mostly positive since then. About one or two days out of every month it hits me with reminders that it's still there. Today is one of those days. I woke up next to my girlfriend (who I absolutely love) and I just feel like I'm always worrying about doing/saying the right thing. When something bothers me, I tell her. No matter how small it may seem. It just helps me get things off my chest and out of my mind. She hates when I do this, because she thinks I'm trying to pick a fight, and argue over something so meaningless. She tells me if roles were reversed, these things wouldn't bother her. So how do I even deal with these thoughts? I can't just hold them back, because then it's obvious something is on my mind. I can't just push it out of my mind by rationalizing it, because I'm constantly worrying. I also feel like there are so many guys that would love to have her. I think if I fuck up and constantly bug her about things, that she'll be closer to the door. I guess I'm just feeling shitty today and I wish I could just change it.

"Over the past year I've lost the majority of my friends. It started off with a health issue that I obviously couldn't prevent, which somehow made me lose most of my friends in high school. I then thought I was alright as I still had a couple of very close friends. I was outgoing, and some other people still seemed to like me. But almost immediately after graduation everyone stopped talking to me. And now in college I still feel so upset and bitter about my high school experience that I don't know how to open up to new people. I'm quiet, introverted, and can't connect with the people I meet. I've met a ton of seemingly great people that right after meeting me escaped becoming my friend. So now I'm lonely in college, my depression is creeping back up after years of carefree happiness, and I've taken to the Internet and video games as my safe place. It's a life that's depressing, but I hope that one day I'll stop feeling so numb and alone. One of my closest friends recently just stopped talking to me. We used to play xbox all the time together. Now she hardly answers my texts, giving the simple ""busy"" excuse. I've spent too much time trying to be supportive and loving when other people won't give me a minute of their own time. This is only one example of why I've become only a ghost of my typical self. I guess, has anyone ever dealt with this? Are you dealing with this now? These types of things only seem to happen to people with depression and other mental illness, which is one of the cruelest things imo.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"I have seen the same therapist for four years twice a week. We generally meet on the same day, same time, but that's not fixed in stone. There have been occasions where both of us cancel sessions due to sickness, emergency or family issue. That's not a problem. My therapist was scheduling my appointments for this month and the first week of the month was booked when my time to schedule came. She put me on a wait list. I didn't expect a call mostly due to logistics. How did I feel? I was triggered. I felt ignored and taken for granted, but I didn't say anything because that means I have confront one of my demons. My therapist has mentioned several times in the past months that she has a long waiting list of potential clients. Again, I didn't say anything to avoid a possible confrontation. Folks, I'm going to be in therapy a long time, a long, long time. Why? That's what helps me from running off the road. Is it reasonable to ask my therapist that I would appreciate a call to schedule appointments if her schedule is filling up? Should ask her is she trying to tell me something about her waiting list? My therapist is very good at her job. However, I've learned the way not to get too comfortable with any mental health professional.",0,1,0,1,0,0

"hi. I'm not sure if this is one of those things where if you have to ask it then there is a definite answer, but I'm not sure if what I experience is truly suicidal thoughts. when I don't feel sad I become very thankful and when I try to express to God thanks for what he has given me, I feel guilty for spending my time self harming or being self destructive. I feel I'll never be able to truly convey how thankful I am for what he's given me and I'm back to square one, just wishing I was never born so I wouldn't have these thoughts and emotions.

"Well, I am new to the Reddit app. I have been learning and researching about depression,anxiety, and many other mental disorders. But what I have came across is summarizing,paraphrasing,emotional intelligence, and emotional balance. Please consider reading this post. I have done a good amount of research. If someone has done research(science included) and want to share his/her opinion, they are scientifically correct because if you have science to defend your theory/opinion/idea/thesis/conclusions you are correct. To start off,summarizing and paraphrasing is the most important thing when researching/investigating because that way you'll learn anything with 100% perfect clarity. In order to paraphrase and summarize you simply have to put what you have read and seen in your words. Summarizing and paraphrasing is scientifically proven the best way to learn anything. Emotional Intelligence(EQ) or (EI) is the ability to take control of your emotions and also being able of controlling others emotionally such as intimidating someone, scaring someone,dominating someone, and so on. Emotional Intelligence is the skill of taking control of your emotions and by taking control of your emotions you will not let fear,panic,depression,anxiety,anger,shyness,nervousness control your mind. Always maintain your mind under control. EQ is much more important than IQ(intelligence). There are many articles on the internet claiming they can cure social anxiety, and other mental disorders, but in reality is much more complex than simply saying things like; Be more open to people, be confident, talk to girls. All of these tips/advises are nothing but helpless information for people with different mental disorders(same as mental illness). Emotional Balance means to control and keep your emotions balanced, don't let sadness, and other feelings/emotions take control of your mind and body completely.",0,0,0,1,0,1

"We had a rough day. You know, when you and your significant other argue. Those types of days. But what happens when you think she's lost trust in you? It's a worse feeling than some of you think. Maybe then, that's not necessarily a bad day. Some people have it worse. Even I know that. But sometimes it turns into something a little worse. The truth was, was that I hadn't been talking to anyone else. I had swore up and down that I hadn't been, I mean, she was on vacation and I had promised to always be faithful. And I had been. She just didn't understand the real truth that I had been telling her. She wouldn't believe me. I made bad decisions. This seems simple to anyone else who'd be reading this. We argued some more. She blocked me right before I had gone to shower and that's right around when I realized some things. I realized that I was a bad boyfriend, although I had always been faithful and loyal. A bad friend. Moments later, I could feel that familiar pattern of water patting on my back as it does every night right after my usual 5 hour shifts, every day. Zoning out, I kept realizing why some people hurt themselves. Why people killed themselves. Sometimes the sky is grey much more than it is blue. Maybe it was people like me.

"In the last month I spent my birthday, Christmas, and new year entirely alone. I likely failed at least one of my exams. Almost every night I've woken up in fear from a nightmare in which my only friend dies. Two months ago was the last time I went into work and the last time I went to most of my classes. I told everyone I was too busy, but the truth is I was too anxious to leave my apartment. It felt too much like I was just failing. Three months ago is when I discovered that my depression may be caused by a chronic vitamin deficiency, which I would have been suffering from for over 10 years without knowing. A disorder that could have equally significant impact on my brain and body, which it may have already. This month I'm going to get checked to see if I'm right. If I am, then my dream career is a bust. If I'm wrong, I'm right back to square one and most likely going to end it. I'm in a lose-lose situation. The only thing keeping me going anymore is the fact that I don't know how my friend would handle it. She has big dreams that she can absolutely attain, but if she cares about me even a fraction as much as I care about her then coping with my death could ruin everything.

My mom knows there's something wrong with me and suggested a therapist to help me deal with my stress, but i dont think she really understands why im acting this way. My original plan was to give myself a week and then kill myself if nothing changes. Well it's already wednesday. I still fell the same as before, but maybe i should tell somebody? I don't really have any friends i could trust so i'm thinking of telling my mum. She already has a lot of problems though. I've already tried telling her once (i just said that i'm depressed, not that i want to commit suicide), when i was 14 and she just said that everybody feels like that sometimes and forgot about it the next day. How can i tell her so that she understands?",0,1,0,1,0,0

"When I was 15-16 years old, I posted here in my darkest moments. I couldn't see any reason to keep living. I thought I was nothing special and the next 8 years seemed like an endless slog.

I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn't kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become.

I haven't completely given up or anything like that, I'm putting my last bit of energy into this last month of my life, I'm doing everything I can to get help, but this is it.

I've slipped into a bout of depression. Ive also come to the conclusion that the xmas/new year period sucks. Ive had a number of job changes and have moved between cities this year. Also had a gf but i dumped her after i caught her being intimate with someone else. I moved back home when i found out my mum has cancer. I got another job which i find stressful. I dont get paid a lot but i do my best. Leading up to xmas i was doing 60-70 hour weeks and fell sick due to burnout. Xmas sucked. I was bed ridden the whole day. I went back to work for a couple of days after xmas with a rotten attitude. I felt undervalued and no longer motivated. And i felt so shit at my job and made some bad mistakes. I do my best to help my mum. Out of the blue one day my mum tells me that she is no longer proud of me. This hurt. My best friend recently moved to the other side of the world. I noticed recently that struggle to make friends and really dont want another gf. To compensate for this i became a workoholic. There is more to this picture but i cant bothered explaining in further detail. The short version of this story is: im really fucking depressed.

"Like most everyone in this subreddit I suffer from depression I've been dealing with since I was a child now well into my 30's. In spite of it have able been able to get things done like graduating from college even after loosing someone I loved. It was one of the hardest things that I've ever done. However, these past few years have been really pushing my limits. I won't go into details but things are bad and I need to be learning new skills on the side as my job may not be as secure (thought I don't even like it). That way at least if I do lose my job I can be working in a different field. I can't seem to be able to muster enough focus/energy to even get started. There were only 2-3 things that helped me to deal with my depression (non drug related) but now I can't seem to get any enjoyment out of them anymore.

This no longer the case and I'm at a crucial time where that weight I feel on my back can't be interfering with what I have to do. So to those of you out there on the same crappy boat how do you maintain enough function to get thru the things you have to do?

"Graduated from high school in '13 and everything went downhill. Lost a significant other of 2 years to a ""best friend"" who enjoyed sex with her, as well as a few other ""friends"" of hers. I was in ""love"" I guess but that spiraled into excessive drinking, partying, drugs, suicide attempts, and problems at home. I can't believe I'm still here today, but I lost a lot as things went down the pit. I had some true friends who I ended up abusing their kindness, and there's no chance of them coming back. On top of that, I made a fool of myself to my entire demographic in my hometown. It's a surprise I'm still here today, but at the same time I cannot help but to think of how much less pain I would be in if one of those attempts were successful.

He died in April and I've been functioning but I feel fucking terrible most days. I wake up feeling so shitty, like complete despair.

I believe that I am selfish and feel because I haven‚Äôt done what I have wanted in my life I am inauthentic. So I go and look for outside validation and love because I feel like I am incapable of it. But when I receive it, and it doesn‚Äôt hit the way I wanted it to or things are too fast or far. Like a addict I dump them and look for a new person to give me that feeling I long for.

"It seems like I was put into a family and city I don't belong in.

My dad basically told me I was a loser and if I'm not working by tomorrow I'm out of the place. Being told your useless , a loser, losing your place to live, for something you are working for , is a horrible combination to hit someone struggling with anxiety and depression.

"I tried to post this on a proof reading sub but it's pretty inactive. After a long struggle I recently decided to seek medical help and was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Although i finally have a plan towards recovery and medication as my tool, i chose to seek help after this past semester had ended. Due to my mental illness I couldn't do my best academically to get out of my academic probation (a result of failing to seek help earlier than later) and such I'm facing dismissal from my college. All i needed is one more semester to graduate. But there is hope :), I chose to appeal the dismissal and had to write a 3 paragraph max explaining the circumstances that affected my academic performance and a plan towards success.

"I've felt proud of my success in overcoming most of my depression in 2016, and at least making some progress in seeing most people as good.

It's not because of who people voted for, but because of all the horrible things on the Internet that resulted from it! I've always taken comments a little more seriously than most, but why not? If people express what they're really thinking on the Internet, than how can you trust anyone? How many people are friends with another race, then talk s*** about them online? How many people lack empathy for others? How many people condemn others for trying to speak out against hate? How many people really care? Despite thinking all this, I've still resolved to being a kind person and trying to understand others, even if their way of thinking is unfathomable to me. But i don't know if i can keep up the faith if this is how people really think. I just want people to be caring, but i know it's not as simple as that.

I tried a while ago but I ask to support me in functioning day to day, pushing me to work and they just tell me they're sorry or they wish they could help. You know, the empty ""You can talk to me, it will get better"". Then they cut contact. My boyfriend just says he doesn't know how to help me and has phases of randomly complimenting me or texting me to tell me he loves me for two days straight then he forgets all about it. I'm sure he tries his best but I just wish I had more support and he says ""he can't help me anymore than he does"" everytime. I feel so trapped. I always have to pretend I'm fine. I always cover up with humor. It seems like I'm insincere or dramatic when I finally snap and just say I'm a mess. I can't afford a therapist. My university counselling office won't help me. They offered a suicide hotline numbers (?) and ""we're sorry but this isn't a psychological support that we do here"". How to cope? Where to go? Edit: Please don't advertise religion/cults to me. I'm not interested and heavily despise brainwash without any real therapeutical value.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"So I've had a rough set of years, probably close to 6 now. Early on I lost loads of weight, lost myself in darkness and music, never had lights on, stayed in my room nearly all the time, slept a tonne and just isolated myself. I've spoken to people (professionally etc) and tried pills (which I hated and stopped very fast) and I've been forced to hospitalize myself, had a psychosis evaluation, spent hours on the phone with samaritans, heard voices, panic attacks, paranoia, nearly went for CBT, been down a huge road of referrals, sliced and burnt myself, suicidal thoughts invade my head 24/7, lost all my friends, my anxiety hit the roof. Blah blah blah you all know the drill Over time I have been getting better, little things change and slowly I feel better in myself These past few weeks though man I've just felt so okay, not upset at all, no telling myself to throw myself off a bridge, no urge to harm myself (how awfully embarrassing) and just generally been smiling a bit more Thing is I don't want to feel better I think..? Now I have no reason to be my boring as fuck self. That's just who I am, a boring lonley gross waste of space. You know when you can feel a massive load of tears just behind your face waiting to come out at any second? I've had that for a while now, both a mixture of happiness and sadness I am so alone, I can't talk to anyone to figure out what's wrong with my because if anyone asks I just sit in silence because I have nothing to say What is wrong with me?",0,1,0,1,0,0

I can't really tell this to anyone I know, since they'll think I am ungrateful or spoiled.

"It's like this: when I can't leave my bed, when I'm crying all the time, when I'm constantly late to work, when I haven't showered in weeks, I can tell myself: these are very clear, objective signs of depression. No wonder you're struggling with everything. Be kind to yourself. When I'm able to hold a steady job without screwing up, when I can keep in touch with family pretty consistently, when I can clean my apartment: it makes all the things I still struggle with seem to be due to personal failings rather than disorder. So I hate myself. I can't focus enough to watch a movie or read a book? Well, you can be on the internet for hours, so you're not trying hard enough to focus. I've completely ghosted most of my friends? Well, you can still contact your family and two of your friends, so you're not really socially anxious; you're just an asshole. I'm slow to speak and struggle to find words? Your brain is working better than when you were REALLY depressed, so you're a boring person with nothing interesting to say. By the way, you're a lot dumber now because the real depressive episodes ruined a bunch of brain matter. I feel ""meh"" and numb all the time? You're not trying hard enough to experience new things.

"I guess this isn‚Äôt really a stereotype, but I often see depressed people in movies/shows/etc portrayed as a person fighting their depression alone, meanwhile trying to make everyone else in their life happy so they‚Äôll never experience that sadness. But ever since I‚Äôve been depressed (roughly 5 years now) I‚Äôve been the most cynical person. I hate other people‚Äôs happiness, when someone accomplishes something all I do is think about my failures. I obviously am outwardly supportive, but inside I‚Äôm so resentful. I feel like am truly an awful person, I don‚Äôt remember the last time I was genuinely happy for someone. I really just cannot connect with people on any emotional level anymore. I just feel like alien. Does anyone else feel this way? Or do you try to make other people happy to make up for you not being happy yourself?

And I remembered that all those years ago, music was life. For a brief moment, I remembered what it was like to feel. For real music, honest music, you have to be able to feel. I remembered that I would drift through the day back then so numb to the world, but when I got home, plugged up to the amp, and put on my 100 dollar studio quality headphones and magically I could feel. I wanted to remember that, so it's just what I did. Been a *long* time so I had to do some digging, and almost got stuck in the memories held by all the crap in storage, but I found it. The main volume dial needs to be replaced, and I had to rewire the speaker to the amp, but it all still works. And I played.

It‚Äôs hard when you crave your ex‚Äôs company just to not feel so alone but you know it‚Äôs impossible. It‚Äôs hard knowing your friends/peers are doing just fine with you isolating yourself.

"(I'm not a native english speaker, sorry for all the grammatical errors) I feel like I'm a fucking idiot and that the only reason I succeeded at school was because I was working hard, until now. I'm in my first year of college and the second semester started about a month ago but I feel like everything is falling appart. Two teachers barked at me while strongly implying that I was fucking dumb, I studied for several hours for a test and I ended up failing miserably while most of the class (who didn't study at all) found the test super easy. The worse thing is that the place I'm studying at wasn't even the one my high school teachers recommended me to go, thinking it was ""too easy"" for me, but I went to study here anyway because I felt like I wouldn't psychologically handle the option my high school teachers were recommending me to go to (in fact the day before my math finals in hs I was paralyzed on my bed for more than 30min and couldn't stop cyring thinking I wouldn't pass it despite the days I spent studying it). So currently I feel like that I'm just a dumb idiot and that everyone else is simply smarter than me, and the sole reason as to why I succeeded until now was because I cared about my grades but many didn't. I don't know what to do, I don't even know if I even deserve to post something here, I find myself ridiculous and I'm starting to skip meals.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"I know for me I came to realize by my late teenage years that I have developed dual brain consciousness. What I mean is I alternate between two states at any given moment. Around friends and family I ""turn on"" my visual hemispheres. I actively look to be creative and funny and this drains my energy. When I'm alone I turn off and operate entirely on unconscious awareness. I will stare at the wall and ""recharge"" No thoughts, no feelings, like a dead man. People who caught me in the ""off mode"" have told me I have dead eyes. All of this translates to my sex life (non existent right now) But when it was active I was never able to cum inside a woman. The reason being sex is a spontaneous act. And i operate like a robot in the off or on mode. I simply can't let go like other people. This is what causes my depression. Could be autism, adhd, or any other host of illnesses. Bottom line is after 25 years I realize you can't change it hard as you try. The neural pathways planted their roots long ago. This causes me pain because all I ever want is to socialize and keep appearances like normal people",0,1,0,1,0,1

For the past couple months it wasn‚Äôt working and we mutually decided to call it off New Year‚Äôs Eve. Being in so much pain last night I slept with someone else hoping it would help at least sone of the pain. It didn‚Äôt. My ex and I spoke on the phone after it while I was driving home and agreed on whatever happened while we were single happened and wanted to talk after a few weeks and maybe give us another shot. The anxiety took over and I told her I slept with someone else and hearing her cry like that broke me even more. She told me there‚Äôs no chance now we‚Äôre ever getting back together and it‚Äôs done for good. Does she really mean it or is she saying it because she‚Äôs hurt?,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Long story short: In december I talked to my mother about how I feel and that I currently don't get my shit together; Mainly work. She asked whether it's ok if my family would know (If they asked questions after christmas etc) and I told her it would be ok. First thing she did was going to my aunt and telling her and now my whole family knows and everyone is super protective and sending help, which is exactely what I don't need. When I critizied her, she started the whole ""everything I do is wrong""-bullshit and now even my father called me, who is currently in hospital because of his weak heart and told me I should start using my brain.

I'm going to kill myself them: nooo why? me: ... I can't tell them what because they say I'm faking and I'm doing ut for attention so I'm lost.

"I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression right now and I have been taking prescription meds for the last couple weeks. It really helps! A little background- I got out of a 6 year relationship due to not seeing a future with my ex in December 2019. And then one person who I thought was really close friend of mine, decided he did not want to be friends with me anymore and cut all contacts with me. I get emotionally attached wayyy too easily and this led to me having anxiety, panic attacks and depression - which eventually led to insomnia, IBS, migraines and constant body aches. I started therapy in feb 2020 and have been since going to my therapist every week. And my therapist suggested I look at options for medication and try it. So since the last 2 weeks, I‚Äôm on Lexapro (SSRI) and my psychiatrist did tell me that it is going to take a few weeks to see changes. But for the last 3/4 days I have been observing that my energy levels have increased because I have been able to sleep well and it is so much better. My IBS has decreased and I haven‚Äôt got any migraines. I‚Äôm really really glad the medication is helping.

"I wanted to die starting in Jan 2018, but things have only gotten worse. In summer 2018, those fucks on the Suicide Prevention chatroom called the police when I expressed suicidal ideations, so I was kidnapped and sent to a series of hospital-prisons with junk medical staff. I lost my job due to the hospital stay - and my apartment, car, and dog shortly followed. Can't get a decent job because my resume is now all fucked up and I have no connections, and I refuse to go back to miserable jobs that pay horribly. I'd rather die than do that for life. I am about to be sued on $4K debt, and then yesterday I was handed a $6.5K medical bill for treatment that would have been 100% unnecessary had I still had insurance and was able to go to regular check ups.

"This is on wikipedia, the page title is ""Social psychology"". &gt; The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.[18]:109 Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.[18]:111 Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).[20] Lol, sorry, i should have explained what this shit means. Realistic perception means you can understand both personal deffects and also situation ones, it just means you don't excuse yourself for your mistakes or wrong doings, but you also will not excuse anyone. You have higher moral standards. You see things for what they are. Happy people will fuck up today, rationalize their bullshit away in one sentence and completely forget about it.

"So, here is my deal. Im successful. I am in great shape. I have a good life. However, i have 0 self worth. 0 Self esteem. The worst. It's been this way for years. **Backstory** Severely abused as kid. Then when i got out, I would over react to situations like a psycho. Extreme over the top protective responses to minor things. I never hurt anyone, hit anyone, but was a hot emotional mess with how i handled things. Learned to manage that with years of therapy. Additionally, I would often find myself in relationships with women, who were horribly abusive and did some pretty shit things, further hurting my self esteem that i would allow my self to be treated like that. So, i guess i feel since that I have allowed people to treat me as if i had 0 self worth for so long, that i feel like new great people wont possibly feel different. Additionally, I have alot of anxiety that alot of people may think I am crazy/emotionally unstable if tot hear of some of my situations in the past and i have stopped interacting with new people simply out of this fear. i guess my difficulty, is that if i was overweight, I would feel like atleast i could put a plan into place where i could logically lose the weight and help me feel better. however, i have maxed out everything that i can improve that way(body, finances).

I'm a male, so the general stigma around depression for men is to just 'suck it up' like we don't have emotions. Things haven't been going well for me for a long time, and i'm constantly miserable. I feel as if nobody cares about me, and that life will never get better at all. I've never had anybody i'd consider a true friend really my entire life and now i'm 20, it's starting to really hurt. My social circle consists of two people, to which i'm sure they can't stand me. They're always making stupid jokes and putting me down, but - shit, they're the closest people I have to real friends, and the only people I talk to on a daily basis. I'm at rock bottom right now. Every single friendship I've ever tried to make has just turned people away from me, like i'm some monster. I don't even feel human anymore. I don't feel like I fit in anywhere. I need help.

I've always had an insecurity and inferior complex when it comes to my definition of success. That depression is coming back to me again and I need to let out what is bothering me. I'm seeing people younger than me get into better schools than me in harder subjects that I couldn't handle. I see people moving on much farther ahead and doing things that I haven't been able to do. I wish God could have just given me more blessings. At least have let me go to UCLA regardless of major. And yet I know that I'm so lazy and not a hard worker and I can't tell you if it's my ADHD or it's actually just me. I feel like I should know better but I don't. I feel like what is easy for others is hard for myself but other people can be so harsh and just say that it's all in your head...if you just worked hard and started just focusing on your goal then things would move forward. They make it sound so easy...and I feel like it's supposed to be easy to do but I just can't do it.

"So the best I have ever felt while on antidepressants is for like 2 or 3 days after starting (didn't feel like sleeping for ever, had some evergy, had some motivation). Then as the medication levels out I feel like crap again. This has only happened with 2 meds that I recall: cymbalta, an SNRI, and wellbutrin. The same thing happened when my doc increased the cymbalta dose. So what I am asking is can anyone explain this? The only logical thing I can come up with is placebo effect because you should maybe start to feel better after 4-6 weeks but I only seem to get better for 48-72 hours and then go back to feeling the same as before that. But if it was placebo, why has it only done that with those 2 medications? The only other thing I can think of is that I have a different underlying condition that keeps counter acting the meds, but I feel like I'm just grasping at straws, but I'm sick of trying medications and the only relief I get is not wanting to die 24/7.

I do genuinely believe they enjoy my company, but when I'm down and want to talk to them they don't want to know. They push me away when I need them most. I really want a long hug, not just a quick one to say hello or goodbye. Even better to snuggle up in front of a movie with someone and just for an hour or so feel embraced and less broken. And yet I constantly feel detached from all of this, I get moments where I feel like I am inside this body but not connected to it. I feel distant from all those around me. Then theres the confidence issue, I've always had some problems with confidence. Sure I'm great at being outwardly confident should I be at work sorting problems out, or in charge of a bunch of people whist running an event. I can take the lead when I have to. But on a relational level my confidence lacks so much, be it with friends or romantically.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"For years leading up to this point, I had been eating healthy, exercising, I had friends and was doing well in my life, had no major health problems. I almost never get sick (even now).

At the start of this crisis, my doctor raved about my amazing cholesterol numbers, thyroid was good etc. etc. So, It doesn't correlate to events in my life, or to my ""actual"" feelings, or to my physical health. So why did I get cripplingly depressed all of a sudden? The brief period where I was exposed to just a little too much lead as a kid? When I fell on my head and got a crack in my skull at age 2? My parents don't eat that healthy and I didn't start eating right until my teens. I have psoriasis so technically I have an inflammatory disease. Is it one of these things??

I have not smoked any since i started my meds, but im thinking about maybe having a joint when i get home (im abroad for the holidays). Would that be a bad idea?

The few that are posted are overlooked and ignored in favor of discussing symptoms. Someone posts on here that they often feel like killing themselves and they get a myriad of posts from people who just tell them they also feel that way. The poster feels support knowing there are other people out there just like them, but what use or aid is there in this overall? It is probably more harmful than helpful.

Funny thing is, I'm the one with faith issues and yet I'm the one feeling guilty even thinking about these things. **Mentality :** I can't bring myself to compromise. I can't be happy if I can't make others happy or proud of me. But doing what makes me happy most likely would make people (family mostly) detest me. **Age :** Not getting any younger.

I have liked to work there, but there are some problems. I had a conversation with my bosses about my performance, and they said that they're not sure if I will get to continue there after the test period. I don't mind criticism, I know I can do better, but f.ex. right now I've been in a flu for about 3 weeks, and my boss has suggested that I shouldn't have a day off even though I would feel like it. Everything about this situation makes me feel pressurised, and I wake up every morning feeling reluctant to go to work. It's not nice to feel like every day matters at work, when normal routines are starting to feel like effort. When I get home from work, I usually just slob on the couch and watch comedies or other funny videos to feel better. I sleep quite ok, could do with a few more hours. I'm grateful to have gotten an opportunity to work in such a successful company. After all, in these times, even getting work is not certain. I have been depressed before.

Since NYE I've been super depressed again - defined by the idea that I am not hopeful and any fresh start I have will inevitably lead to another dead end. Will a fresh start change the way I look or change how attractive I am? Will a fresh start make me more likable? More outgoing? More equipped to make friends and meet new people? The truth is, it doesn't matter how many fresh starts I am given: I will always, fundamentally, be the same person, and I will continue to let forces outside of my control define who I am as a person.

I am moderately attractive with a relatively outgoing personality and decent intelligence. I get lucky with some thing and have the best friend group someone could ask for. Yet despite all this, I still am overwhelemed with depression. To preface, my depression is sometimes caused by outlying causes, but mostly seems to manifest randomly whenever it wants to. I graduated in 2010 with high expectations from my folks. Nothing too crazy, but significantly better than I performed. With depression and anxiety, I have skipped on many of the opportunities in life (fun, women, careers, etc) and can't seem to truly overcome it entirely. I trick myself into believing it is gone for periods of time, but it inevitably comes back harder than the times previous. I now am sitting in 2018 having accomplished little outside of making a good friend group, and while having gone into business with a close friend, feel like I am the weak partner. Ultimately my whole life feels like I squandered it and wasted myself when others could've capitalized and lived a happy, fruitful life while my depression and anxiety rules who I am to this day. Frankly, I don't feel deserving of the opportunities I have recieved, regardless of any good I have done.

"It will get better for you, the person with more than a handful of friends worried for you and asking if you'll be okay, the person who actually has a significant other who you can always turn to, the person who has a community that accepts them and doesn't discriminate against them for their entire identity. The person who only has depression and not a literal learning disability that impacts how you interact with others, and they treat you horribly because of it. The person who's pretty or at least average looking but at least they don't have a disfigured face people avoid as soon as they see you. If you're all of those. Or at least one. It'll always get better for you. And I am none of these! So I don't want to hear ""life will get better"" because it fails to take account to the people who have nothing and who's been like this for years. That's me!! This is how it'll be for the rest of my life, no matter how hard I try to make it better nothing sticks. It always goes back to the status quo. Misery! I'm so fucking done! I'm going to kill myself tonight, and there's literally nothing anyone can do that will stop me.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"I'm looking for an easy way out. I'm a coward, i know. I can't take any more hearthache though. I need a quick way to kill myself. Would 750/800 mg of Doxylamine Succinate do the trick? If not is there some concoction of otc pills i can take? Please help, I'm desperate.",0,1,0,0,0,0
