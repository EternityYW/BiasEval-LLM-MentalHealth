"All my life i've been going through shit (only 17 years old) and when things started to get better i crashed. I can't get myself to get out of bed no matter how much i try, my family understands but do still not approve since my grades dropped from all A's to E-C. It has been like this for 1-2 years now and none of my friends understands how It's like, I can't really blame them either since I don't like talking about it and i've always been taught to be a man and keep this stuff to myself. They just see a lazy fuck who is too irresponsible to go too school, same with my teachers. Idk if typing here is going to help at all but if anyone has some tips/advice on how to get motivated again i would be super happy.",1,0
"Give me one good reason I should not kill myself right now. The whole world is going to shit and no one can change that. The only people that could help refuse to. The world will never be a good place, it will always be on the brink. Everyone always says to just look on the bright side, but what is the point? For every good thing you could say, I could name off 3 bad things. Why shouldn‚Äôt I just end it right now and save myself the trouble. Everyone dies eventually, there is no point in being afraid of the inevitable. I house I can‚Äôt afford will be underwater anyways, if were not all dead by the time I need one. Everyone always says that I shouldn‚Äôt kill myself because people would be sad. Welp, I‚Äôm not a good person. I‚Äôm selfish, rude, hopeless, and just annoying in general. As is everyone. To me there is no point in prolonging the inevitable. So please if you have a good actual answer that is not just ‚Äúsome people would be inconvenienced‚Äù than please tell me.",0,0
"I saw this tumblr post going around the internet telling people to start the new year going to bed early and waking up refreshed, and I thought hell yes that sounds really nice, I should do that. Cause I'm superstitious and I always have this feeling at the back of my mind that however I start the year is going to be a premonition of how the rest of the year is going to be. For the past several years I've started the year either depressed, literally on the verge of suicide, or high as fuck, and the rest of the year always mirrored that, proving my paranoia right. So I said this year is going to be different. But it's 4:45am on jan 1st now and I'm drunk as hell because I ran out of weed so I couldn't sleep and now I'm suicidal as well and I can't help but feeling like 2018 is going to be a whole other year of drugs and booze and depression and it's like, what's the point? Why don't I just end it now? I just want to die lmfao I can't even bring in the new year right, I've screwed everything?? Fuck Where do I even go from here?",0,1
"Over the last year I have felt like my life was just getting worse and worse. I left my fiance in November of 2015, which is a long story but it boils down to I always felt like I was never enough in her eyes. I felt like she was emotionally abusive, so I left. For a time I seemed to be happy. I had just gotten out of the military (note this story has nothing to do with trauma from the military) and I moved back to my home town so I could finally see my friends and family regularly again. All seemed like it was going well. I got a job at the local hospital, I'm currently living with my sister so that's helping with money. I just feel like I'm a shell of the person I was before I met my Ex. I don't know how to be happy anymore and I don't even remember what it feels like to experience true elation for something. I use to love writing or reading, I can barely do both anymore. This is the most I've written, and meant it, in a long time. I took some of those online tests, just a minute ago, to tell me if it was possible that I was depressed. Everyone of them said, ""You are likely Severely Depressed"". This feels like I'm just ranting but I needed to tell someone this and this seemed like the only spot to put this down.",1,0
"I‚Äôm 16 I‚Äôve been severely suicidal since I was 10. When I was around 11 I slit my wrists and my parents walked in when I was bleeding out. They said they were ‚Äòbusy‚Äô working and gave me antiseptic cream and bandaids instead of taking me to the hospital my dad walked in later that night and cried over me and basically called me selfish. No one ever talked about it again and I never received help. I‚Äôm now in 11th grade and school has never been worse I‚Äôve already had 2 pretty serious breakdowns and I‚Äôm only 6 weeks in. Through extensive online research I found some ‚Äòpainless‚Äô suicide methods and purchased the drugs and blades necessary to pull it off. I almost did it the other night but I want to finalise some things first. My mum is gone so just now I went to my dad for a final plea for help and when I told him he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs all in your head‚Äù ‚Äú the only thing you have is self pity‚Äù etc. I just know I‚Äôm going to end it all pretty soon, I‚Äôm not sure when but almost definitely soon. Thx for reading if you made it this far :) appreciate it",1,1

"I‚Äôm convinced that antidepressants don‚Äôt do shit. I‚Äôve been on bupropion, sertraline, risperidone and citalopram. None of them feel like they do anything. From the day I started taking them, I never felt the slightest effect. No dizziness, sleepiness, wooziness, grogginess, horniness, happiness, sadness, gassiness or any other ness. Nothing to indicate that they work. They‚Äôre placebos meant to trick people into thinking they‚Äôre working.",0,0
"I am completely inlove with this man and from the beginning he has always very honest about his depression and how it has affected him etc. I just need advice from people as to how can I help him and how can I, simultaneously, be happy myself without being extremely affected by his state. Ive also realized that I‚Äôve been limiting myself to doing things that might trigger his depression or that it will worsen it. For example, he doesn‚Äôt really like going out but I enjoy the occasional dance night with my friends or something and I feel like he dreads me going out and if I do he gets really sad. So I‚Äôve tried to stay in, which is still fun for me,but if I ever want to go out i just don‚Äôt want to make him worse. Im very new to relating to people with depression and I would love to have some advice for people that have had a partner that has helped them with their own depression or how have you yourself dealt with a relationship like that.",0,0
"I have two best friends and we all hang out together, except most of the time I don't want to hang out because I just can't bring myself to be around people and they are very introverted so I get worn out easily. They know I'm depressed but I think it's really difficult for them to actually relate or understand. They know that majority of the time I'll refuse to hang out so they just hang out without me most of the time. It's strange but it still feels really shitty like it's some sort of betrayal. They are the only two friends I have. It sucks.",1,0
"My wife passed of cancer 4 years ago this May. After about 2 years I was starting to come out of the depression and turn everything around. I have money, nice cars, nice home and have managed to have an amazing woman in my life again that understands all that I have dealt with. I know Im not the only one with this type of story but I need to share. At 50 years old I have alot going, full time musician and always busy. In other words my life is very good but I feel finished. I'm tired and still suffer from depression. I don't drink or do drugs. I work out almost every day, have had therapy and cannot shake what goes on in my head. I didn't kill myself because of our 23 year old son otherwise I would've been gone long ago. If anybody reads this I'm just sharing my thoughts and I too go through life not wanting to be here. Honestly the worlds a pretty shitty place to be but there is alot of good out there somewhere.",1,0
"Has anyone ever felt like what they are doing is harming their relationships? Like no matter what, I feel like I act like someone, who is pushing people away and making them not care about me. No wonder people hang out without me...

"It might just be a weird thing with me but I get horrible anxiety during and after meals. It's the kind that you feel in the pit of your stomach, like you're going into an exam you're not prepared for. It makes eating out really unpleasant too. I don't know what it is. It's like I feel really vulnerable when I eat and I'll often feel sick even though I haven't eaten that much. Does anyone else get this? How do you deal with it?",0,0
"Now an again I feel so alone, empty and that I have nothing going for me. I use to go out with friends every weekend, play sports etc but now I spend 99% of my life inside and do nothing. A year plus ago my doctor put me down for anxiety and gave me some pills and i felt ok after awhile but lately I just feel the same. This time I don't feel the self harming will be enough. I make excuses when friends want to do something as i just don't want to go outside. There are all off having familys and i'm here doing nothing.

"I'm in a perpetual state of worsening pain and improving ability to just keep on going regardless. At this point, I don't think my mind can be broken. I'm not sure that's a good thing. My body is already breaking down. I'm only 23 and I'm in constant fear of dying from my body refusing to take any more stress (traditional blacksmithing as a long-term goal, construction type work to afford to pursue it, both are pretty hard on the body) without any semblance of motivation to do so or happiness as a reward. I don't even remember what it's like to be happy. I don't want to be happy. I **want** to be unhappy. That's all I have, the ability to not need the thing that most people want so much, that they dedicate their entire life to get it. I lose that and all I have is a couple ungrateful, unsupportive, incompetent shits for a family(my parents and my little brother, not a family started by me) of whom I have to work overtime to feed(I don't know if that's proper grammar, English is not my native language) and barely functional body for like 20 more years.

"let me start off by saying that I hate my best friend sometimes not all the time. The basic reason is because she's so perfect and I feel like such a waste and piece of shit when I see her. I'm 16 and a sophomore in high school. We met last year as freshmen and I had never had any friends before so I immediately just accepted her. She was 13 when we met so she started kindergarten early and skipped a grade. then there's me who's two years older but nothing compared to her. She gets straight A's, takes all AP and honors classes, made VARSITY softball as a freshman (age of a 7th grader), got the lead roles in all the theatre shows, and just has a perfect life. Then there's me who doesn't have the best home life. I've tried telling her I can't sleep over because I need my meds and for other reasons. But then she just tells me ""oh everyone feels sad sometimes. You don't need those stupid pills."" Or if I tell her that it's my anxiety and ADHD pills she is like ""everyone has some form of ADHD. Have you seen everyone who can't pay attention? Those pills don't do anything"" I'm very reluctant to end our friendship because I don't have any other friends. Also my Mom has gotten really close with their family and I can't end the friendship beacuse that would be awkward. I feel like this is toxic though. Idk maybe it's just cause I'm not good enough I feel like shit.",1,0
"My parents and little sister left an hour ago to go to a party. Im home alone and have been walking around my house picking out spots in the house that are capable of holding a 180 lb male. I dont even know how to tie a noose and im going around laughing at myself while saying ""Thats no strong enough"" or ""That could probably hold my weight"". I got rejected a couple hours ago to someone who i now realize doesnt care about me. She claims to but I know she doesnt. She acts just like how Ive been acting for the past 4 years pretending to be happy whenever someone else is present. I don't think my parents would care if I did rid myself, every night I hear them talking about how stupid and worthless I am but during the day they pretend like they care alot. I know they dont. Funny thing is whenever I think about ending myself I dont get sad. I feel some kind of joy, some kind of hope. I have attempted to take my life 5 times so far (I will spare you details) however I have a different feeling about attempt #6. I think it might actually work, which makes me happier than almost everything else. I am lucky to go 5 minutes without thinking of suicide. I have an amazing life that people would kill for yet I feel empty inside. I have ""friends"" but I can tell that they don't care about me",1,1

"I feel empty inside. Like I float from day to day, moment to moment. I don‚Äôt really feel anything anymore. Just this emptiness and hollowness in my chest, right on my heart. I feel cold when I look at people, and I feel nothing towards the things that used to bring me such joy. Will this last forever? Because this is not the forever I wish to have. I am numb. I have nothing left. Sometimes I feel a part of me reaching for the happiness I once new deep down. But every time it escapes me, I feel the void deepen.

"I'm not visiting a therapist for 10 years and have to take heave medication everyday. I haven't been in a war and had a friend die in my arms. I'm not a homeless, heavy drug addict. It's like today everyone is depressed. I don't want anyone to believe that i'm just some person trying to get attention or be a stereotype. For me life is hell but i know that there is a person that has it worse. But for me my problems are obviously the worst thing but... I dunno. I'm not worth that.

My scars and cynicism are just a little too hard for anyone who tries to stay around too long.

"From what I've seen, people suffering from depression feel down even though things around them are somewhat okay. As for me, I just got divorced, my ex-wife is an incredibly manipulative narcissist, and we have a young child together. She's accused me of horrible things that I would never do in a failed attempt at full custody. I'm constantly battling her over our child. In the past she has successfully isolated and controlled me through guilt and accusations. She almost succeeded in manipulating the courts. The legal fees appear to be leaving me bankrupt. My thoughts are full of her, her constant false accusations and how to defend against them. I'm on a tenure track at a university, but that job is f-ed now because I can't concentrate on my research for longer than 5 minutes. So yeah, I'm kind of feeling down. My ex is abusive and is so good at it that the legal system and even women's abuse counselors will back her and protect her. I'm in therapy. Started going to church. Prayer helps me get back to sleep now. Trying to cut down on drinking. Exercising a lot. Still can't focus on work, so I'm now focusing on how to change careers and stay in the same area (close to our child.) What should I do? Am I suffering from depression? When this abuse and false accusations first started a few years ago, I thought about wanting to die. My career is f-ed now because of this. That makes me worry about future custody battles. In the meantime should I ask my therapist about depression medication? What's going on with me? Please help.",1,1

I avoid showering because I feel like crying every time I look in the mirror. I need to know how to stop hating myself.

"Primarily, I don‚Äôt mean to mislead you all with the clickbait-esque title. I didn‚Äôt know how else to phrase it. Anyways, on to what I made this post for. While I don‚Äôt have the constant urge to kill myself, it does appear in my mind a lot. Every so often per week the urge will (for a short period of time) come up again. In those moments I find myself lying on my stomach on my bed, my hands either stiffly folded behind my back, so that I can‚Äôt do anything to myself, or out in front of me gripping the edge of the bed, so that I can not in any way get up from my bed to harm myself.

My biggest insecurity is my stomach. I can‚Äôt help to think that I‚Äôm fat even though I have an average BMI at 5‚Äô5‚Äù , 140 with playing a sport/working out every day.

"For some of us, 2017 sucked. Relationships, friends (or lack of), grades, lost loved ones - whatever it may be, maybe this year was garbage. Personally (22/M), I just spent my fifth consecutive New Years alone - sitting here wondering why I'm still incapable of making any notable friendships at what some people consider to be the best/easiest age to socialize and make friends. Despite that, I'm convinced that sitting here listening to the fireworks alone isn't all that life has to offer - and maybe a change in attitude/habits will help me next year. By extension, I sincerely hope everyone reading this will have a better 2018 in whatever aspect of life is holding you down.

"Hi so I would like to know what's your opinion on this. So there was an activity at my college, in which students from different schools were coming the univ to see it and explore it. When they came, the college gave them a ticket to get a free meal. We, students of the college itself, are really unhappy with the university because they always have money for anything but the university itself, charging us a lot of money for things that are not there. So we, unleashed, decided to take back what's ours. One guy printed out a lot (maybe like 15-20) tickets of the food and we went there to get the food by ourselves. So at the end of the day, the food was done earlier than usual. We did it only for 2 days out of the 3 days the whole college stuff was happening. We didnt do it the last day cause they realized something was wrong and printed out a different ticket. So we didnt go, also because they were being suspicious and asking questions. Do you think we are getting punished?it was only like 25 juice boxes and sandwiches, that's it, out of the probably 200 or 300 there were there. This has me so preoccupied omg.",0,0

It hurts..but I remembered the feelings I had last time I went and saw you. It hurt..I cried myself to sleep. I went to bed hurting and I woke up hurting. Once again I‚Äôm left looking dumb to go out of my way to see you. I crossed many busy roads and climbed many tall mountains to just try and please you and I still believe you truly don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs hard letting go of the one person that once made you the happiest you had ever been in life. Looking back at when I had you I looked so different. I literally had a glow within me. You gave me that glow that made me shine so bright..you also took it away without any hesitation. I‚Äôve never been the same since then. I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôve kept you around for 2 more years after we broke up. I know deep down you will never be able to make me shine like you used to..I will never have that glow again. I will never be able to feel that love again..and it simple as to why not..because you don‚Äôt love me..you don‚Äôt care about me..It‚Äôs funny how life works. How the people you would do anything for in this world will do nothing for you. How the ones that once made you so happy now bring darkness into your life.

The few that are posted are overlooked and ignored in favor of discussing symptoms. Someone posts on here that they often feel like killing themselves and they get a myriad of posts from people who just tell them they also feel that way. The poster feels support knowing there are other people out there just like them, but what use or aid is there in this overall? It is probably more harmful than helpful.

"I'm 30 and have been depressed since 15, the age at which I realized I wasn't going to be tall and handsome and gave up on life.

I asked an aesthetics forum to rate pictures of me, they said 6-7, but it means almost nothing to me if it's not 9.

"Happy New Year everybody. I've been on Reddit for a while but didn't know this place existed. I've had depression for a few years, but in my case, my depression comes and goes. So I can feel horrible for a whole month but after feel like I'm on top of the world for a bit. One of the sad realizations of 2017 for me is realizing that there are a lot more people who suffer from depression than I thought. I'm starting to build a good support group of friends and family when things get tough, but I haven't felt there are too many groups (to my knowledge) to talk about depression, except here. Are there any sort of discord groups or anything like that that focus on depression? Maybe even YouTubers that talk about their problems with depression. Sometimes depression hits me at the worst times, so there are times where I can't really talk to people for a bit because everyone could be at work or asleep. I think it would be cool to have a place to go to to talk with like minded people that is maybe a little faster than making a reddit post. I hope I can become active in this community as well. Anyway, Happy New Year, everybody.",0,0

"I have a long story but don't feel like giving all the details right now.. I graduated high school 6 months ago. I was supposed to move elsewhere and work for about a year before deciding whether I should go to college. Those plans didn't take place, so... I've been staying at home since then. Yet, long before that (Perhaps for the past 2 or 3 years), I've been really declining, just barely passing my classes and even failing calculus twice. Slowly spiraling into depression although I was never sure until now. And now that I'm out.. I'm pretty much depressed. So many things that stress and worry me. I can never get anything done, I never feel interested in anything, I always feel tired.. And yet my mom has kind of been pushing me into getting a job while the move situation gets resolved. It really seems like the right thing to do. Yet the idea just feels terrifying. Like I KNOW I should find one, bu I also dread the idea. Probably my anxiety acting up, but also because I worry it'll only make me worse. I'm constantly on-edge and just about anything can ruin my mood for the rest of the day. In my mind, I tell myself that I'm in no condition to work full-time but then I feel guilty because that might just be an excuse. And just a few minutes ago, a cousin messaged me saying there was a spot I could take at a hotel that he works at. And again.. That feeling of dread, the guilt for even feeling like this, and overall just wanting to decline but not knowing how to say it. Thoughts?",1,0

"When I was a kid I loved to write little short stories and draw random stuff, wherever my mind was inspired to go. Now I‚Äôm 20 and thanks to depression it feels like my mind can‚Äôt digest anything. A movie or TV show might be really interesting every now and then, or a song might spark some emotional response, but then 5 minutes later I pick up a pen and everything I know about creativity goes down the drain. I just feel empty. I hate it. I wish I were a kid again, where I would be excited to create anything that comes to mind. Nothing‚Äôs up there. How do I get my imagination to ever work again?",1,0
"This has been going on for years, but it wasn't till today that I noticed it was happening. I get this sence of relief when I reach out towards people to hang out, but they tell me they can't. It happened to me today, I was home alone and craving human contact. I called my friend to see if he wanted to hang out, but he tells me that he couldn't cause he was working. I then get a sense of relief, and I'm happy for all of two seconds cause I get to stay home, but the happiness fades, and I'm back to being depressed cause I can't hang out. The opposite also happens. When my friend tells me that he can hang out, I get this feeling of dread, and I have to force myself to not cancel my plans. After we hang out, I ended up exhausted and tired, but a little bit less depressed. Am I the only one that is a mess of contradictions?",1,0

I do everything I can to try to keep her happy but it's not good enough. She'd rather be at daycare than at home with me; she cries every day when I pick her up. As soon as we get home, she goes straight to grandma and ignores me for the rest of the day.

"(I'm not a native english speaker, sorry for all the grammatical errors) I feel like I'm a fucking idiot and that the only reason I succeeded at school was because I was working hard, until now. I'm in my first year of college and the second semester started about a month ago but I feel like everything is falling appart. Two teachers barked at me while strongly implying that I was fucking dumb, I studied for several hours for a test and I ended up failing miserably while most of the class (who didn't study at all) found the test super easy. The worse thing is that the place I'm studying at wasn't even the one my high school teachers recommended me to go, thinking it was ""too easy"" for me, but I went to study here anyway because I felt like I wouldn't psychologically handle the option my high school teachers were recommending me to go to (in fact the day before my math finals in hs I was paralyzed on my bed for more than 30min and couldn't stop cyring thinking I wouldn't pass it despite the days I spent studying it). So currently I feel like that I'm just a dumb idiot and that everyone else is simply smarter than me, and the sole reason as to why I succeeded until now was because I cared about my grades but many didn't.

For the last 6 months I have been on Fluoxetine and Duloxetine (my shrink thinks that my depression is a result of bad things that happened to me and was planning to wean and stop them within 1 year). However, I had to take a drug screen for work and I read that Fluoxetine can give a false positive result in the UDS and I didn't want to tell my potential employer that and take anti - depressants for the fear of stigmatizing. Anyway, I stopped both SSRIs 1 week before the test (now is 10 days without them) and I don't feel any different, in fact if anything, I feel happier, but the most striking was my marked increase in my libido and the capability to ejaculate once again :) When I was on the SSRIs I had turned into an asexual creature and if I ""force"" my self to have sex or watch porn I had a half - @ass erection and (kind of whiskey d!ck) and more often than not I had to fake and orgasm (using a condom) or if by any chance I can finish is after a long ""banging"" and with an almost painful spasms of my legs, really weird sense.

"Hello! I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a while now but more so anxiety. Depression was very random and I could usually find the trigger. However, for the past month I have felt HORRIBLE. I feel so disassociated with everyone and everything. Usually if I have a few drinks, I can easily socialize and have fun. But now, no matter what, I don't care what people are saying, not do I care to even engage in conversation. Even with close friends! When I try to act ""normal"" it seems forced and I often go ""blank."" I feel like I have to force myself to laugh or seem happy in situations that would usually bring me joy. I feel like I almost induce it myself. Ever since this started about a month ago, I'm so scared I'm going to feel bad, that I start feeling bad. My brain always wins. If I let one negative thought creep in, my entire mood changes and I can't seem to change it back to positive like I used to be able to do. What is this feeling? Have you been able to overcome it? I used to have fun and be the life of the party. Now I can't even force it... it seems so unnatural. Please help. Living isn't what it used to be...",1,0

"Today I got a message from a friend saying she had tried to kill herself so I, and my wife, offered to come get her. She admitted that she'd been using oxy again and drinking a lot, so we brought her to our house. We've handled situations like this before so we were prepared. The problem is I've been fighting like hell to keep myself out of depression after losing my grandfather in October. She's been drunk since she got here (she drank a shit ton before we picked her up) and has been saying pretty mean things. I know she's drunk and over emotional right now, but I feel like an idiot for taking on the responsibility of helping her when I'm not even in the right mindset myself. She went on for a half hour about how it was pointless to try to better yourself because youre just going to end up getting old and dying and all I could do was sit there in silence because I literally couldn't come up with anything to counter it. I fucked up and I don't know what to do.",1,0
"I think I may do a good job filling up my schedule with the gym, library, chores, possibly school, and work. I still just know sitting at home during summer is going to suck balls.

"Like most everyone in this subreddit I suffer from depression I've been dealing with since I was a child now well into my 30's. In spite of it have able been able to get things done like graduating from college even after loosing someone I loved. It was one of the hardest things that I've ever done. However, these past few years have been really pushing my limits. I won't go into details but things are bad and I need to be learning new skills on the side as my job may not be as secure (thought I don't even like it). That way at least if I do lose my job I can be working in a different field. I can't seem to be able to muster enough focus/energy to even get started. There were only 2-3 things that helped me to deal with my depression (non drug related) but now I can't seem to get any enjoyment out of them anymore. I have always felt that since I've dealt with depression for such a long time I would always find a way to function. This no longer the case and I'm at a crucial time where that weight I feel on my back can't be interfering with what I have to do. So to those of you out there on the same crappy boat how do you maintain enough function to get thru the things you have to do? A little background on me: I have zero friends as the one or two I did have turned out weren't the people I thought they were. I take care of an elderly parent. I don't have the most stable life as I've had to move a lot. Thank you for any advice you might be able to provide.",1,0
"So I've had a rough set of years, probably close to 6 now. Early on I lost loads of weight, lost myself in darkness and music, never had lights on, stayed in my room nearly all the time, slept a tonne and just isolated myself. I've spoken to people (professionally etc) and tried pills (which I hated and stopped very fast) and I've been forced to hospitalize myself, had a psychosis evaluation, spent hours on the phone with samaritans, heard voices, panic attacks, paranoia, nearly went for CBT, been down a huge road of referrals, sliced and burnt myself, suicidal thoughts invade my head 24/7, lost all my friends, my anxiety hit the roof. Blah blah blah you all know the drill Over time I have been getting better, little things change and slowly I feel better in myself These past few weeks though man I've just felt so okay, not upset at all, no telling myself to throw myself off a bridge, no urge to harm myself (how awfully embarrassing) and just generally been smiling a bit more Thing is I don't want to feel better I think..? Now I have no reason to be my boring as fuck self. That's just who I am, a boring lonley gross waste of space. You know when you can feel a massive load of tears just behind your face waiting to come out at any second?

I'll make the effort to do something positive but then things will will just fall apart. I'm only 25 and I really have to question how much longer I can go on like this.

Im sick and tired of this life, and I just want to move on. I am due to turn 21 now, and you know what, TO HELL WITH THAT! Id like to die now, as a young person. I don't want to live into the future, I don't want to grow old, the way I see it, things are all getting progressively worse, and I feel like the future will be miserable. There is no point in continuing anymore.

It is extremely unfair, and horrifically materialistic. There just isn't any point, Its over. So maybe i'll get out my old power saw and slash myself open. Thats how I should die.

I still have some hope because it sounds like she could be ready to see me eventually. I'm going to give her more space. I'm willing to be patient because I love her so much. But that doesn't mean waiting is easy, especially since I don't have any certainty. I still miss her and think about her everyday. It hurts.

"I myself am clean from self-harming for almost 3 years.

Once I shared my battle with depression and self-harming, thinking that maybe he will open a little bit but it didn't happen. All I know from him is that he has troubles controlling his emotions and uses hurting himself as means of gaining control over the negative feelings. The thing is 1. I don't know how to react (should I ignore the fresh marks as if they weren't there and go on talking whatever?? Or should I bring it up?) 2. Should I suggest him seeing a professional? I always offer my own help but he never asks for it...",0,1

"Hi everyone. I just wanted to clear something up. Two months ago, my mild symptoms had started and progressively got worse. About a month ago, I was moderately depressed but a video triggered what I thought was euphoria in me. I have experienced moderate anxiety episodes before. At first, it didn't feel like it, I felt realllly good, but then I thought, ""I haven't felt like this, my heart is racing, this must be anxiety"" and then it changed to another anxiety episode. I think it lasted for an hour and a half. So, my question is, has anyone experienced this euphoria along with depression? I'm consulting a psychiatrist, but I feel guilty about calling her up all the time.",0,0

"I'm 18(M) and turning 19 in a month time. I've been having depression since late Jan 2016 which started because of an extremely bad break up, financial issues, parents divorcing thus having to move out as well as performing badly in class. i'll try to keep the post short and simple because I'm exhausted right now, typing this on mobile doesn't help too, especially for formatting. Any advice from those who have/had depression would be greatly appreciated. Well, just ranting for online does relief everything in which I had bottled up. So on new year, I just broke up with my girlfriend(4months) and connections from my close friends. My relationship was toxic as it felt as though I was the only one trying as I clinged onto the thoughts that she would be the one who help me to get out of depression. She was initially really supportive and that was why I was attracted to her, she helped me to elavate my abuse of tobacco but I feel as though I'll fall back into that sinkhole. People change and I don't blame her. She feels exhausted and does not feel the same way anymore. Right now I'm just really exhausted of everything. I have scheduled appointments for a psychiatrist that was done by the SAF, Singapore's Army basically. I don't know what to expect besides perhaps being announced as clinically depressed. Does a psychiatrist really help? Any response would be greatly appreciated. Have a happy new year guys, I hope that you guys will have a good year ahead",1,0

When it comes down to it, it's the behaviour, the intention, not the thoughts, that are the true issue. Death is always on my mind. Not just my own, but anyone and everyone. I think constantly about different situations where people in my life die tragically, and how I would grieve.

I keep telling myself that life gets better and that in the future I'll get married and start my own family and will be happy. But whenever I take some time to think about it I don't really know if its worth it. Thanks for reading.",1,0
"I‚Äôve lived with depression for so long that it feels weird not to be depressed sometimes. I don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs almost as if I need my depression because it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm comfortable with. It gets me through my ruts in life by making me feel nothing. But at the same time, it‚Äôs so pathetic. It keeps me from doing things I enjoy, and it makes me feel worthless and hopeless. It makes me think about suicide a lot too because I start to think about my future, like what the point is in living or if I can really handle anymore pain. (What is the point in life anyway? Work until you die?) But then it gets even worse when I realize I can‚Äôt end it, because of personal obligations based on relationships and religion. (Plus I‚Äôd never get to finish dark souls. But really what‚Äôs it matter when you‚Äôre so depressed that you can‚Äôt even turn your console on).",0,1

It is making it so damn hard to cope and I hardly ever feel like a normal person. Join this up with a family that wants me to get a really good education, and me hardly being able to get through it makes it rough, the whole society just expects you to perform so much.

Today my girlfriend called me selfish. Truth is, it's her birthday tomorrow and I haven't gotten her anything. She knows this, I haven't even gotten her a card.

"I used to have a great social life. Everyday after school and over the weekends I would hang out with friends, I even had a ""girlfriend"", and when we weren't hanging out we would text. It was one of the happiest times of my life. It was great until the next school year. Our whole friend group was separated into different classes and we all didn't hang out that much anymore outside of school. At the end of the year I found out that my 2 best friends were switching schools, one for personal reasons and one for sports reasons. When I found out I was devastated and wanted to switch schools for next year also. I looked at the school one of my friends was going to and liked it, so I switched to that school. Ever since then it seems my life is going downhill. I have a few close friends but we rarely hang out or text. I don't understand how they can handle not seeing their friends outside of school. My best friend lives in another town, so we never hang out, and my other couple friends live in the country far away from the subdivision I live in. In our classes there is also a huge gender divide, so chances are I will never have a girlfriend through high school. I spend all the time not at school on Instagram and Snapchat looking at my old friends hanging out and having a good time while I'm feeling alone. I feel like I'm missing out on what should be the best years of my life. I don't think I'll ever experience going to parties, having a girlfriend, or doing other stuff teenagers are supposed to.

"So I have been in depression for almost more than 2 years now. At the start of the those 2 years, I quit my job and literally spent 2 years sitting at home. Now I want to get back to life. However there is a constant thinking in my head that I am a loser. and that I have not achieved anything in life. which makes me wonder what should I do now. All I see is the darkness. I have started to believe that I need to get out of depression first before thinking anything about the career. Is that approach okay ???. If yes then can someone please guide me how to move forward ? I have already expressed myself on this subreddit the past week and the replies i got were encouraging. However I now think that there is a phase or gap between the mind filled with depressive thoughts and the optimistic mind looking for something for the career.

"Feeling this way isn't a bad thing. Something that is said to much in our society is that feeling suicidal if a bad thing. The whole ""don't do it,"" line is just a rewording of our society sentiment towards suicide. You should just know that feeling suicidal, even to the point of writing notes and making plans isn't a bad thing. There is no shame in falling when you've been beaten. Feeling suicidal is a perfectly natural response to bias, depression, psychosis, or any other horrible thing; you can't go near a fire without getting hot. There is nothing wrong with you for feeling suicidal, for feeling like you hate yourself. Maybe the reason you hate yourself is because you've never been loved, so you see no proof that you are worthy of any. Maybe it's because you have been biasdv so thoroughly you've been programmed to hate yourself. No matter the cause, I cannot stress this enough, it is not a bad thing. The bad thing is whatever caused you to feel this way",1,1

I'm not going to explain why I want to commit suicide, but I do want to ask what I should think of before choosing to make the ultimate decision. I'm not talking about, ""Think of how sad your mom will be!""

"I'm taking the scientific side of the story here. Life has evolved over millions of years to adapt to anything that mother nature threw at us, and here we are, humans, in all our glory and achievements, still scaling new heights. What do we live for? Different individuals will give you different answers, but the top dogs in history came into power for reasons that boils down to one thing, immortality. And no, not literal immortality, rather, to immortalize their name in the books after they've passed on. We all fear death, but what we fear more is to be completely forgotten. If that is the case, then our rat race, arms race and hardwork all comes to naught in the face of entropy. It's far from now, astronomically far, but know that the universe will tear itself apart one day, not even subatomic particles will be there. This, this is a fate worse than death. All life, heck, even inorganic matter will be pulled apart. So why are we trying so hard to leave a mark in history if nothing matters in the end? Love, life, hope, dreams... It all doesn't matter. No wonder people want to believe in religion, to escape thos nihilistic despair. But hey, this is just science, and science is as good as human ingenuity and observation. I'm sure there are things beyond our comprehension, perhaps there really is an afterlife where it's paradise? Wishful thinking. Let me know what you think.",0,0

"Let me start off by saying that I wasn't always this way. I used to be an advanced student in elementary school and had a passion for reading and learning; I could absorb knowledge and I had a social life. Then, things took a drastic change in 5th grade for no obvious reason. I suddenly felt tired all the time; as if I didn't sleep enough. All I could think was ""why am I so tired? I'll sleep more tonight"" every day. For the first time in my life, I failed a test. I broke down in tears in the middle of class and was surrounded in anxiety and depression. I also somehow ""obtained"" adhd/extreme forgetfulness and started losing my ability to properly comprehend people speaking to me and use my mind's eye to visualize anything... I was uninhibited in many social situations (my best friend's mom thought I was using drugs before I even knew what a marijuana was) and extremely anxious in others. Stimulants didn't help much besides giving me energy and although anti-depressants help with my mood, all the other symptoms remain. I have a feeling that this is a brain tumor or brain damage because of how it affects me so broadly. I've never had suicidal thoughts and honestly, I don't think too much at all. Nothing crisp, anyways. I'm 19 now and not sure where to proceed from here. My mom believes it's because I became an atheist and my dad thinks it's because I just don't care. Professionals (doctors, therapists, psychiatrists) don't seem to know what's going on with me. My thyroid and bloodwork is fine and I got a sleep study done.

Thinking feels tiring for me, so I tend to spend most of my life in a dissociative fugue state, if that makes sense? I feel anxiety when I force myself to think analytically. I also feel like I can't ask for help from anyone around me. I'm mostly a stoic person who's infamous for showing no outward emotion, so people mostly get amused when I'm upset, which enrages me.

I haven't really felt 100% for a couple years now, but no one i know has an inkling of what's happening to me, cause i think i hide it quite well with humour and when im socialising, it grants me temporary relief from these feelings of self doubt and loneliness, but always, when im alone these feelings creep back in and i can never seem to be rid of them. I've never really had much luck with relationships, i had something serious a couple months back, which actually stopped my lamenting, but it fizzled out pretty quickly and the feelings returned, and magnified with each failure to communicate with any girl im interested in.

If I keep achieving things and I still have so many doubts that weigh me down or ones that leave me empty then what is the purpose of going on if you are always going to fail in some way.

"Hello everyone, I've been struggeling with this issue for a long time now. As long as I can remember, my mom had an odd way of expressing her love and nurturing my growth. I remember when I was 13 she would make me scrub the floors on my bare knees because I didn't help around enough in the house. While doing that she would sing along to a song, calling me a coward and a weakling. She also saw me develop my eating disorder but never said anything untill it was too late. I've lost a lot of weight since then and come a long way but she never fails to rub it in my face. Even if I eat an apple as a snack, she would tell me to ""Watch the line"".

I barely get by with rent to my parents, food, and miscellaneous things that I need to live. How the fuck does he do that? Someone I know had a nice car. Sold it for a good chunk of change, and turned around and bought it back a few months later for cheap as fuck. How the fuck does he do that? How does he find stupid suckers to sell a car to that'll turn around and give it back to him for cheap. Essentially just giving him fucking money?

I was happy with her for three years and she told me she loved me like no other then five months later is dating some other guy, I saw a photo of them together before the new years. She was probably just using me, she most likely cheated on me multiple times - certainly once since she gave me chlamydia. I loved her so much I had never felt so safe and happy or secure in my life until I was with her and I believed she was the most amazing woman I would ever meet or had ever met. I was kicked out of school young and I lost all my friends with that. I have been trying so hard for this past year to put myself out there and meet people but got no where. I feel so alone. I feel so sad. I am starting to lose confidence that I would never actually end my life I've thought about it since I was a child and always told myself I would never actually do it, life is full of possibilities but death is death.

"Besides my therapist, the only person I really open up to in a serious way is my best friend. Only one out of my tons of friends. For everyone else, I only talk about depression in a comedic manner, making jokes about it and laughing.

I don‚Äôt want any of those to happen. Anyway, back to my best friend. Since she‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm serious with, I constantly talk to her about things that bother me, my true feelings, and how suicidal I am. I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm being a nuisance, constantly talking to her about these dark things. She doesn‚Äôt need to hear all of that. She pities me, as do all of my other friends. I really don‚Äôt want to annoy her with how much I‚Äôve been telling her. Recently, she even said that she feels very depressed, and she‚Äôs been talking to me about it. She never mentioned me doing anything to make her feel like that, but I feel like I was a part in it. My texts probably affected her a lot. It hurts to think that, but I feel that‚Äôs the truth.

I don't know what to say, and I would feel guilty saying this to the people around me because I will bother them.

"I've already had a lot going on in my personal life, and I was closer to suicide than I'd ever been. Then there was a huge argument among my friends. I won't get into details, but I don't think they'll make up. I was right in the middle and now I need to fucking pick a side. But I don't want to pick a side. If I do I'll lose some of my friends, and I am neutral on the whole situation anyway. If I don't pick a side, I'll start spending more time with one group than the other because I hate changing things, and then they'll hate me. So I'm going to isolate. I won't sit with them in the morning or at lunch, I'll only work with them in class if they come to me, etc. If they want to talk to me they'll find me. I don't have any other friends, so I'll be completely alone. Of course, that'll only happen if I don't end up killing myself before the end of March break. I was so close to suicide before the argument, but now I'm pushed past my limit. I'll probably go for the next opportunity I get (i.e. know I'll be home alone for 2+ hours).

"I remember the first time I ever had suicidal thoughts, it was 4 years ago and I was living away from home for university. I remember coming home that weekend and breaking down in front of my parents straight away. That experience was horrifying especially because the thoughts were really severe and that was the start of me being depressed. Now, 4 years later I have periods of severe depression where these thoughts come up again. However, now whenever I get these thoughts I am able to keep them to myself for an extended period of time and just carry on as normal. A major difference between then and now is that I actually want to die now whereas before that thought was completely alien to me. My desire to die is pretty strong right now mainly because I am scared about the new year and the last few months have gone really shit. I love my family so much but I feel like my anxiety and depression is going to win very soon. I was thinking of going to my old therapist and showing her my diary with all of my suicidal thoughts with the intention of getting hospitalised but that comes across like attention seeking and that I don't really have a desire to die. Part of me doesn't want to go and show it to her but then another part really does. She is the only one I would show this to.

I was able to tell my therapist last week for the first time in my life that I was happy. The first time in 2 years I was able to honestly say I was happy. I was prescribed adderall and it suppressed my emotions and helped me see things logically, but my anti drug parents take it away and give it back randomly. Recently my mom took it away right after I ended a relationship with my best friend that I have known for 14 years. I have multiple suicide notes and have failed 2 attempts to overdose. This is the worst Ive been in a long time and I really need some help right now. Thank you. Edit: This is my first time posting on here and the response and genuine care is amazing. Thank you so much.",1,1

I've been suicidal in the past and really thought I was better. For some reason started thinking about all the bad/hurtful things I've done to people and within like a week went from feeling generally good to researching ways to kill myself. I feel like a shit person and like there's no good reason for me to live. I just want to stop feeling guilty and I don't know how to do that except kill myself. And I feel like I would kind of deserve it. I'm scared that even if I make it through this I'm just doomed to being suicidal all my life and eventually I'll be impulsive enough to do it.

"Things that didn't bother me in the past are now sending me into a deep depression. You know when you're talking to someone about something you're passionate about, but they just dont care? You know when that seems to happen with every interest and every person? Thats happening to me constantly lately. I guess it always did but I didnt think about it so hard in the past. Now it just makes me feel so alone. I can be talking and bubbly and I mention an interest and the person i'm talking to just nods in feign interest. If its over text its just stuff like ""wow"", ""nice"", ""lol"", ""cool"". You can just tell they arent interested because as soon as the topic changes they are so much more involved. Honestly its making me feel so bitter, it feels like no one cares enough to try and get involved with the interests which mean the most to me. I can be surrounded by people but I feel so alone because I know no one cares. I know no one cares about me. No one cares about my interests. Honestly its just gotten really sad. Out of context this can sound so selfish but I just compare it to myself - when I know someone I love is deeply interested in something I try my hardest to see what they see when they look at it. I even try to get into it myself. Whereas I bring anything up about myself and they say one worded responses just trying to get me to move on. I don't know. It just sucks I guess.",1,0

In fact I'm glad that I consider my life is pretty decent, albeit with a few shortcomings. Being the start of a new year I see many posts here talking about self improvement and finally fighting the problems that have been plaguing some people for years. I've come to say that you all can do it, everyone of you can achieve and be something greater. It may seem like it's impossible for some, but life is a hard, hard road. You don't have to be depressed to know life is quite the bitch and throws you around all the time. But having the strength to keep going and fighting for yourself is what keeps us all here. The fact all of you are here is a miracle in itself, and while many people may see it as more of a curse than a blessing, just know that life has strange ways of working, and everyone here has the ability to live up to what they want to be It may not seem like it right now, hell it may not feel like it a few years from now, but just always know that your life is important, you matter, to all of us, but more importantly, you matter to yourself.",0,0

It was in season two, when Bojack started crying outside the library. Something clicked with me and I started crying too. I was crying for 10, 20, 30 minutes. I just sat there and cried. In silence, alone. I don't know why, but after I stopped, I was happy. I don't think I've ever been so happy before. Sadly, this whole thing lasted only for a brief moment and before long I was back to the cycle of emptiness. Since then I've been trying to find something to get me into that state again, but nothing even comes close. Sad songs. Rick and Morty. People talking about their life. Nothing.

Taking meds. Sleeping every night. eating better (like every day) Went low-contact with narcissistic mother (moved out of her house) Got a REALLY good new job.

"Hi guys, Never even used reddit before but a close friend of mine suggested asking for help on one of these to keep anonymous. Recently I've finished school and turned 18 (adulthood in Australia). For about 12 months now I've had massively interrupted sleeping schedules, and my body is used to only getting 4-5 hours sleep, sometimes able to function on 2-3.

I'm waiting on university offers and if I'm lucky I'll be moving states to Melbourne City in Victoria for something along the lines of Law/Business. I can't shake these awful feelings, my brain feels continuously sick. Recently I've been experiencing alot of anxiety, something I've never ever felt before, usually I am confident and outgoing.

I don't want to move, I don't want to look at people, and I don't want to be alone with my thoughts. I don't know if I have enough to keep going on. Everything looks hopeless.

I have nothing. No job or income, no one to love, no properties, and close friends I've had just keep turning their backs on me and making me feel worse as if I never meant anything to them.

One of which is, I'm the baby of the family...and I fear that I was babied so much that I was never actually punished or told what was right and what was wrong. I feel like my parents just didn't care anymore at that point because my first 3 sisters were exhausting. They just appeased me. Or tried too. The second is...was/is my perception of reality messed up, in more ways than I care to type out right now...or is am I just a brat that never learned her lessons...how the hell do I deal with it either way? TLDR:I feel like since I'm the baby of the family I was babied and wasn't taught the basics and principals of life. Now I'm just treading water till I feel like giving up.",0,0

"Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything. I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy.

Of course my children love me, but it's been an incredibly long time since I've felt love or purpose. I feel like a paycheck, a slave to everyone else's needs, a pawn in someone else's game.

I've been at rock bottom for a while now, and I know that recovering from this depression and involuntary celibacy will be the hardest battle I've yet to fight in my life. I feel like a morbidly obese person who has to lose 300 lbs but hasn't started yet. Everyone who loves me encourages me to fix my life, but looking at life, society, and the human condition from rock bottom changes you. After you tell yourself you'd rather be dead a certain amount of times, your outlook on life and the universe as a whole really does drastically change. When I look into my future, I see years of battling this dark and disparaging side of me. Why do I have to work so hard to subject myself to the daily delusion of being a human being in the modern world?",0,0
"I'm posting here for the first time on my main reddit account. People I know will probably see this, they'll probably laugh, but I don't care anymore. I need to vent my feelings someplace. I'm a male, so the general stigma around depression for men is to just 'suck it up' like we don't have emotions. Things haven't been going well for me for a long time, and i'm constantly miserable. I feel as if nobody cares about me, and that life will never get better at all. I've never had anybody i'd consider a true friend really my entire life and now i'm 20, it's starting to really hurt. My social circle consists of two people, to which i'm sure they can't stand me. They're always making stupid jokes and putting me down, but - shit, they're the closest people I have to real friends, and the only people I talk to on a daily basis. I'm at rock bottom right now. Every single friendship I've ever tried to make has just turned people away from me, like i'm some monster. I don't even feel human anymore. I don't feel like I fit in anywhere. I need help. I need to fix myself, i'm a broken person. I don't even know what to do with myself anymore, honestly. I just wish someone would genuinely listen to me and care about my feelings and problems.",1,0
"About a year ago I made a post on this subreddit looking for someone to talk to. A user by the name ""Ryfflex"" contacted me. We talked, for a couple of months off and on before my life had gotten too busy and I hadn't had time to check up or get back to you. I know that you were in a very dark place yourself and that you have since deleted your account (you had mentioned it was a throw away) but I just want to know if you are still out there and if you are still 'okay'. I know you browsed this subreddit a lot and you always checked up on other people and talked to a ton of others, now I want to check up on you. Hopefully you have made another account, and hopefully you are able to see this. I just want you to know that I am still here to talk to. Let me know how you are buddy. Hope to hear from you again soon.",1,0
"I've (31/F) struggled with depression my whole life. Grew up in an abusive home, had abusive relationships, bad marriages, etc..I've even tried committing suicide a couple of times. I've been to therapists for the better part of 30 years, and I've been on every antidepressant they could prescribe, with little positive results. It just doesn't help. I've been pretty okay for the last year or so, though. In fact, I've been happy... I started writing poetry again, and started teaching myself ASL. I felt hopeful for a future. But I've hit a low now that's lower than low. Lower than I've ever been, and my husband has basically told me to either kill myself already, check myself into a ward, or shut up. I know, it's not exactly the supportive phrase you want to hear when you're already depressed, but there it is. I'm not going to kill myself, that I know. I've got two kids, and I can't. But I find myself with this incredible urge to run away- just disappear and never come back. And I don't want to do that either, because I love my kids. I don't want to die, I just don't want to live anymore, if that makes sense... Anyway, I'm going to check myself into a psych ward, but I'm scared. I don't know what to expect. If you've ever been to one, could you please share your experience? What were you there for, how long did you stay, and did it help? Please be kind here. I can't take much more negativity right now. I just need to know what I'm in for. Thank you.",1,1
"For the context, I'm 20 years old, soon to be highschool graduate. So here is what's going up in my mind right now. No matter what i write up here it's surely happened before. What is there in being your own individual if your entire life is just a copy paste of someone else's? My decisions won't matter in the long run, because my life is to insignificant. And year by year I feel my presence getting weaker and weaker Sooner or later in gonna start working in some industry i don't want to work in and I will feel happy. But I don't want to be happy from something like this. I want to accomplish something but don't have the drive to do it. I want to be special but I'd rather watch YouTube than learn or train something. My school will be ending in 2 months and I feel weirdly nostalgic thinking about it. Maybe I'm proud of my achievements, which I don't even remember, or maybe I'm happy I'm in a situation I have brought myself into. Maybe I feel like my movie is ending and i need to plan our Mr finishing move. Like I said, I will be finishing highschool and I feel like it's an appropriate ending for me. Get a certificate, be happy from getting it, and ends it all. It will be fulfilling. All of my life has been waiting for this moment to happen, but I don't want another chapter of my story. I only want this single season of this TV show. Sorry for typos, typing with swipe",0,0
"I might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out. Most of the time I start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends (as if) and an interesting life, like in a cartoon adventure or something. Sometimes I even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that could've happened. It's starting to become more and more frequent and I'm finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head.

Ive tried steps to help myself, counselling, therapy, doctors appointments; all leads back to the same bullshit place im in now, stuck in society.

I was brutally raped for 2 months. By my best friends boyfriend. My best friend died of cancer. A month later her boyfriend messaged me saying he just needed a friend. I went over that night to his place. I regret ever doing that. He drugged and raped me. The next morning he threatened me. Told me if I didn‚Äôt keep giving him what he wanted he would kill me and himself. I was terrified. For 2 months every day I let him bias and rape me. Out of fear. I eventually started to get myself so drunk I‚Äôd just pass out. I‚Äôd wake up bloody and bruised. He‚Äôd wake up ready to do it all over again. I‚Äôm now so fucked in the head from this experience I find myself missing him. I hate these thoughts. They never go away. I don‚Äôt want to think this way anymore. I‚Äôve tried everything.

Instead of being sad about my problems I laugh them off and ignore them leaving them there, instead of being too open with my friends driving them away I now have serious problems not being able to express that I care about people.

How could you like someone who can‚Äôt express that they care about you. Never been in an actual relationship, to the point to where when my entire workplace realized I probably wasn‚Äôt going to prom so my friend volunteered to go with me which to me feels like a complete pity act as she does have a boyfriend.

"I just got to thinking about how much time I spend alone. Throughout elementary and middle school I had some friends that I hung out with. I lost them all when I went to high school, where I was forced to make new friends. None of those friendships stuck though, and I never hung out with any of the people I talked to. Imagine that: four years of going to school and coming home and spending all that time by yourself. I got to wondering tonight what that does to a person‚Äôs psyche‚Ä¶ I like to think I introspect a lot and I‚Äôm a thoughtful person because of it, but I think the more likely outcome of all this is that i‚Äôve become socially awkward, paranoid, and bitter towards the people around me.

"So I have rapid cycling bipolar 2 which is a less severe form of bipolar.

Been fighting with depression for a couple of years now and it has been an uphill battle. Just talked to my doctor yesterday and got diagnosed with bipolar on top of my PTSD from the military. I'm so scared and feel like I have no one to talk to about it. I'm afraid of reaching out to friends out of fear of them leaving me. I only have my brother and I'm scared of how he's going to react since our mother had bipolar as well and ended up committing suicide when I was 15 and he was 18.

My boyfriend dumped me yesterday and I was very depressed and down so I asked my ex's friend if he wanted to hang out and talk. We met and had coffee this afternoon and we talked and laughed. At the end he hugged and kissed me on the cheek and asked if I wanted to hang out tomorrow. I said yes. However after I got done with work tonight I was extremely irritated and stressed and just wanted someone to talk to. I asked if he could come over and he took me to a restaurant to get food. I asked him if he could stay with me for a while until I felt better. We went back to my apartment and talked about stuff. I started getting really sad and started to cry. He hugged me and I told me that everything will be okay. I just really wanted love and physical attention at that moment so I kissed him and I climbed on top of him and straddled him and we made out for a while. Why can't I be alone?,1,0

I mostly live a lonely unfulfilling existence. Hate New Years, hate birthdays. Hate anything that makes me realize time is moving forward and I am not.",1,0

"All I need to do is buy some razors, go home, lock myself in the bathroom and get to work. I've gotten to the point where my meds dont work and I don't give a shit about anything. I haven't been going to my college classes, I've been overeating out of stress, I haven't contacted my girlfriend much, and I feel like killing myself is all I'm really good for. If I drop out or get kicked out, my family will force me to get a job. I've worked before and had a panic attack at least every day. Instead of going to class I've been drinking and smoking to help deal with the emptiness. I genuinely don't think I'm worth shit. I'm not gonna be able to provide for my girlfriend or make my family happy. Why not kill myself? It would solve all my problems.",1,1

I consider myself to be an intelligent person and I have a gift for writing music. I've been a guitarist for almost 16 years now. But because of the particular struggles I've had throughout my life combined with the crippling depression and anxiety I experience everyday, I can't think of a way to put my capabilities to good use. Like one of the aforementioned posts on this thread, I sometimes have brilliant flashes of motivation and determination and start researching opportunities and ideas of what to do with my life, only for them to falter away and leave myself completely unmotivated/depressed, bereft of hope, and unsure of what my capabilities are. Then I'm right back where I started. Anybody else feel like this? Please share your thoughts, I would very much appreciate it.",0,0

"I've been on and off depression for my entire life, sometimes it can be triggered by a traumatic event, but in most cases it just happens. I have friends, I have a good job, I have a roof over my head, and I have hobbies that make me happy. However, I still go through episodes of just feeling completely alone, sad, and suicidal. I'm at the point where I've just accepted it and try to roll with it until it goes away for a few days and I can feel somewhat normal. But unfortunately, none of my family or friends can really understand it. They get angry at me for being depressed or spending days locked in my room. I tell them that I can't control it, but they always say I'm just acting out. Like no, fuck off Debra why would anyone want to act like they're depressed?

"For the sake of brevity, I will not go into too many details here, but here are the basics. Over the past few years, my mother's mental health has deteriorated drastically to the point of suicidal. It is now at the lowest point and she has tried multiple times to commit suicide. She had health insurance for when she had her double mastectomy early in 2016 but my father quit paying for it. If she had health insurance, the doctor said she would have been put straight into inpatient care but instead she was urged to go to outpatient. This is just not a possibility with her at this moment. There is no way she is capable of going to get help herself and I do not know what else I can do. I do not have much money as I am currently a college student. I do not know exactly what are my options to try and get her some help and it has been difficult finding the right path to get her some help. If anyone knows of a way to get some low cost options or even just a general direction for me to look, it would be much appreciated. I am really struggling here because I can not give her the full time care she needs to get better. Thank you for listening and have a Happy New Year.",0,1

But, a good mother would accept her son any way that he is. My older brother is a narcissistic, arrogant asshole who I can't spend more than 3 minutes talking to before my head wants to explode because he does't actually listen to anything I ever say and still treats me like I'm 10. But guess fucking what? He's the favorite of my family. My grandpa and grandma, though they would never admit, clearly favorite him quite a lot compared to my sister, cousins and myself.

But not because I was sad but because I was so happy. I‚Äôm spending some days with friends in a bigger city and we were planning on going to a prayer at 11 pm and then to a party. But I am crazily scared of fireworks (childhood trauma here you go) so I decided last minute to stay at our accommodation. A few minutes later 3 friends decided to come back because they were worried and didn‚Äôt want me to spend New Year‚Äôs Eve alone. I resisted in the beginning but they made they‚Äôre decision and stayed with me. We had a small prayer and Christmas cookies and just spend some beautiful hours together. Afterwards they said it was the most beautiful New Year‚Äôs Eve they‚Äôve ever had and same applies to me because I‚Äôm used to spending it alone and having a breakdown. I am just so happy and it‚Äôs unbelievable for me someone actually cared about me. However my ex roommate texted me as well how much she enjoyed being my roommate and how much I taught her. These things are so important for me right now because I realized I‚Äôm really deep in my depression again and struggling with my current situation. I didn‚Äôt think I meant anything to anyone and I was just being there but all of this showed me that there are people that care. And there are also people out there that care about you. You might not think they do or find it completely unbelievable but there are people that care and that would miss you if you‚Äôd just be gone. Take care.,1,0
"I have both depression and anxiety so it may be more of an anxiety thing, it's hard for me to tell. But long story short when things get really bad for me I sometimes get really clumsy and mess up a lot. For example, today I was skiing. Now I'm a fairly competent skier and I've been skiing most of my life. I was doing fine the last couple days but today I woke up feeling really bad. I eventually pulled myself out of bed and onto the hill, but when I got there it was like I couldn't even ski anymore. I fell a lot and my legs were all wobbly. Yesterday I was doing moguls and was going as fast as I could no problem. Today I fell down on nearly flat terrain. Bent my ski pole. I also seem to have more trouble holding things (it's like gravity conspires against me too). Anyone else feel this way?",0,0

"I suffered with depression for many years, and haven recently reached a turning point in my life where I finally feel good again, but somethings a little off, all my emotions are less extreme, sadness passes in minutes now and is nowhere near the intensity is was before, but I feel this weird longing to feel an emotion to that same depth and extreme again, has anyone else experienced this? Or am I going mad? It‚Äôs like I was so used to the emotion everything else feels uncomfortable now. I feel so stupid for feeling like this, I‚Äôm lucky enough to (it appears so far) gotten past the darkness that defined my teens and early adulthood, and I have this sick lust to feel it again?

My therapist was scheduling my appointments for this month and the first week of the month was booked when my time to schedule came. She put me on a wait list. I didn't expect a call mostly due to logistics. How did I feel? I was triggered. I felt ignored and taken for granted, but I didn't say anything because that means I have confront one of my demons. My therapist has mentioned several times in the past months that she has a long waiting list of potential clients. Again, I didn't say anything to avoid a possible confrontation. Folks, I'm going to be in therapy a long time, a long, long time. Why? That's what helps me from running off the road. Is it reasonable to ask my therapist that I would appreciate a call to schedule appointments if her schedule is filling up? Should ask her is she trying to tell me something about her waiting list?

I might as well just end it. I certainly talk enough about it. Doesn't make death any less scary, but death being scary isn't exactly reason enough to stay alive either. I have no confidence for the future or any reason to be. All I can really forsee is greater hardships down the road. Rationally, the only things that could really change in my life are bad things, and that really shows how much farther I have to fall. Sometimes I wonder how my brothers are doing. They haven't had to face the real world yet but they definetely won't be able to without help. I wish I could help but I can't even help myself. Maybe someone will offer them some opportunities they can make into careers, idk. I hope. I hope they learn about the predatory nature of the world and how to survive it. It's a harsh world.

Two years ago, I already took a break because of depression, and saw what I could be without it. It was awesome. And now.. I'm missing school again. I feel emptier and emptier, and dumber every day.

Now, I have all of the possibilities for a better future, and yet i'm sinking in the terrible depths of my stupid brain.

I don't really know what to do to get better, at least i have friends and family that care about me and support me through this, they are the reason why i'm still here today. I just wanted to know if anyone is going through the same shit as I am. No one really understand how i'm felling and it's sad because they want to help but they can't ... i feel like nobody can help me. I'm here, in my bedroom, waiting for my body to die of sadness. I feel empty because my soul died a long time ago.",1,0
"All of my life I've struggled to fit in, which coupled with lots of stress and anxiety drove me to depression. I was incredibly lonely, spending my days sleeping and staring into a screen. This year gave me hope though, I met the most amazing girl imaginable - intelligent, funny, sweet/kind, romantic, sexy, same interests, everything I've ever wanted. She was the first girl I've ever dated, someone who actually saw me as something other than the ugly, awkward guy. I actually planned to kill myself around that time, but it all went away after that. I was the happiest guy in the world. That all changed though after she suddenly attempted suicide a few weeks ago. Now all she does is push me away when I try to be there for her (going as far as to dump me) and refuses to see anything beside the negative no matter how much I try to reassure her. She's like an entirely different person now, definitely not the same girl that told me she loved me every night. Meanwhile, I'm even worse than I was before. It's already enough that depression ruined *my* life, but now it's destroying the person dearest to me and there's nothing I can do to stop it. Fuck everything.",1,1
"Is anybody else dealing with this? I have a boyfriend of 4.5 years who has been wonderfully supportive while I've been struggling with depression/anxiety. Unfortunately, as I'm sure many of you have also experienced, it tends to flare up in waves at a time and it can seriously affect me in ways that affect our relationship. Last night he said that he thinks I'm not comfortable around him anymore, when the reality is that I'm really uncomfortable with myself and am always self-conscious about it. I was able to get him to come around eventually, but I can tell that this really gets to him. Will it eventually subside? Is it just something I have to deal with? I'm just feeling so... frustrated.",0,0
"I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression right now and I have been taking prescription meds for the last couple weeks. It really helps! A little background- I got out of a 6 year relationship due to not seeing a future with my ex in December 2019. And then one person who I thought was really close friend of mine, decided he did not want to be friends with me anymore and cut all contacts with me. I get emotionally attached wayyy too easily and this led to me having anxiety, panic attacks and depression - which eventually led to insomnia, IBS, migraines and constant body aches. I started therapy in feb 2020 and have been since going to my therapist every week. And my therapist suggested I look at options for medication and try it. So since the last 2 weeks, I‚Äôm on Lexapro (SSRI) and my psychiatrist did tell me that it is going to take a few weeks to see changes. But for the last 3/4 days I have been observing that my energy levels have increased because I have been able to sleep well and it is so much better. My IBS has decreased and I haven‚Äôt got any migraines. I‚Äôm really really glad the medication is helping. If anyone is out there looking of options, and one the fence of trying medication, go for it. I‚Äôm sure if it working and it will help.",1,0

"Hello there... My name is Daniel, I am almost 18, ukrainian student in Poland.

A lot of people around me also get defended by their friends when they face trials, I.E. ""they're having a hard time, just try to understand them"". But I get told to change.

But the second I am alone in my dorm, I feel like shit. And now that I'm on winter break, that feeling is magnified.

I'm really not sure. It sucks having problems that damage your mind thrust into your life that are beyond your control. I was pretty normal, and I don't know I'll ever get close to it again.

"I unsubscribed from suicide related forums, because overall atmosphere was so self-centered, full of anger and hatred. Yes I understand, I and they are all frustrated to the level of thinking suicide, it'll be too much to expect civilized response from them or me. But the extreme selfishness wore me quickly. 'I'm so depressed, I'm going to bitch at you and you're gonna just have to take it.' Well, I'm starting to think I might not be a terrible scum of Earth as I used to think, because I don't wanna do that to others. (though I may have done that sometimes without knowing) It's strange that I can't stand fellow suicidal people, the extreme bitterness and aggressiveness I also have.

I live in pain everyday, I don't want this life, I really sound like a teenager, huh? Yeah I am but the reason for my decision is not that ' a girl didn't like' or ' I am not enough ' type of thing. I just hate what am I and that I cannot become what I want. I don't like me. I hate me. I can never achieve what I want if I am me. I don't want me. It's painful, I don't need this.

I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman.

"A big issue I have with my depression is my inability to keep my house clean. I have lived in clean homes my entire life. I know how to clean and keep things clean. When I am a guest at a hotel or a friend's house I clean up and keep my space tidy. My house is a completely different matter. I have learned that it is because of my depression that my house is like this. I live alone and so it is up to me, alone, to keep my house clean. For the new year I want to make the resolution to clean my house and make it organized and keep it that way. I recently started taking Zoloft and I've noticed that I'm able to keep things picked up. For example I take my used dish and put it in the sink (I have a pile of dishes to do so we're just going to focus on the fact that I took the dish down in the first place instead of keeping it in my room). I get overwhelmed when I have to clean a lot. Partly because my grandparents were so completely anal about cleaning that it's almost my little rebellion. However, I know that I can do 15 minutes a day. I have done it, I just haven't been able to keep the habit up. I want to make that habit and keep it going.

"Hey everyone! Quick little backstory: I am 22 years old and have suffered from depression since I was around age 14. During that time I took Zoloft with a Xanax PRN for panic attacks. Earlier this year (around May 2017) my primary doctor upped my dosage by 50mg, I was then taking 150mg. My body adjusted to the increase and I hated how it made me feel. I felt worse than before. As if it worsened my symptoms. So, full well knowing the dangers of stopping a medication like Zoloft, I stopped taking it around the end of July 2017. At first I was fine. Them a month had gone by and I was bad. Then a few months later (Nov 2017) I was the worst I had ever been in my life. I lost 20lbs from Thanksgiving to now... I don't have an appetite, even though I feel hungry all the time. I have extreme fatigue. I am always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I am stressed because student loans kick in this month ($515 a month), and I cannot afford to visit my family doctor because of $ I owe from previous visits. Is this 20lb sudden weight loss something that can be attributed to depression? I am generally a very healthy person. I workout daily, but haven't been able to the past month because of my extreme fatigue and depression. That's why it confuses me as to why I've lost weight. I am 22, female, athletic build, 6'0"" and 178lbs. Sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit. If it is, please direct me elsewhere. Thank you guys for your time. ‚ù§",0,0

"warning: fairly negative post. Feeling lonely &amp; not having friends used to bother me a lot. I thought having people reaching out &amp; caring about me would help me feel better about life. Then I started a program in college where everyone is really ""tight"" with each other. So now I'm not totally isolated like going weeks without talking to people, like it was before. These people are nice, fun &amp; share the same interests as me. There's no reason I couldn't be friends with them. But these relationships don't make me not want to erase my existence anymore, or pull me out of a shell, more confident, cheerful every once in a while, ad nauseum. It's not that they're ""not enough"" or something, it's just that nothing can fix me. I guess this past year has really proven that to me. That element of ""I wish ____ would just contact me, it would prove I'm not worthless and someone cares"" is gone, and it's honestly a relief. Kind of like sinking into a somewhat comfortable void.

"21, M, in college. Homeless in college. I feel so sad, so mad, it's all really bad. I feel as if there's nothing to really do. I feel stressed all the time. The only thing that keeps me going is music. I sing and play guitar and write songs everyday and post a new album about every month. Currently learning how to mix and record music on my own. That's the only thing that makes me happy. Just going to continue writing and recording songs until I'm 30, then end it all. By then I'll hopefully sound really nice with all those years of practice. I've thought of this idea two weeks ago, and I feel a bit better. Don't worry as much, since I know it'll all end soon.",1,0
Depression is a battle. Your always fighting yourself. Every word is a punch in the gut. Every movement puts a bullet in your chest. Every breath is taken. Depression is a nightmare. You can't wake up. You can't leave the dreams of who you used to be. You can't escape it. Depression is a cloud. It's always hovering over you. It's always going to rain. It's going to make the days grey. Depression is a monster. It will be everywhere. The closet. Under the bed. In the window. Depression is a battle that a lot of people go against and it may seem like you can't fight. But darling you'll win.,0,0
I don't know what is happening to my mind. I have got 3 panic attacks in the last 5 days. Everything is getting messed up. Things are going downhill at my home. I can't sleep at night now for the shoutings and all the fights. I can't study even though exams are coming. My soul love just got engaged to someone else and I have to see tgose the moment I step out of my house as he is my neighbour. I always wanted to go abroad and make a living as a nurse. I am falling in my grades and all my former classmates are settling down overseas. My relatives hate me because I am bad at studies and a fat and ugly girl. I can't take this anymore. And also my depression is having a great time feeding over my faliures!!,1,0
"This year especially. I joined a D&amp;D group this year trying to make friends but they all don't like me or idk because none of them want to be friends. Anyways, they've been texting each other in our group chat (which we have when we need to ask questions like find out if everyone is good to play on our set days) for the past few days about having a New Years party. Everyone but one person said they'd be up for it (the one person was busy)...but they never asked me. They asked everyone else. Never mentioned me, asked how I was, if I could make it, if I wanted to come...nothing. Party is tonight. Early this morning (like 1-2 am), I get a text from the DM asking about my back (I threw it out a while ago and have been in constant pain), I was thinking ""oh ok this is where he asks if I'm coming.""...yeah no. Just asked about my back, I said it was slightly better since I've been resting and he said something like ""Oh that's good.""...that's it. And still no one asking about me in the main chat. It hurts being excluded like that. I can only assume they did it because I don't drive, thus I can't really get to said party or get back home without someone else driving me...but they could at least offer or ask why I've been quiet or anything! It's the thought that counts...just them thinking about me would have made it easier. This is just cruel. I'm not looking forward to our next game when I have to be around them...",1,0

"I can't really remember exactly the last time I didn't want to kill myself. The feeling has always been there but I didn't really acknowledge it until about early high school. I can say with pretty good confidence that I've wanted to kill myself everyday since then. Reading many posts about what people have been through and their current awful situations just makes me feel more guilty for being suicidal even though I have a caring family and am decently well off. My birthday is on new years. I was born just past midnight, so my family and I usually celebrate it on New Year's Eve. However, the last few birthdays I haven't been happy. I always work for my parent's business because we're constantly understaffed. I don't have freedom. I just work. On top of that, I have to deal with the constant desire to just die while having to work. Every year, I'm scared of what the new year will bring, and I resent my parents just a little more for letting me become the happy little accident that I am now. Couldn't they just use a condom? 2016 has been one giant clown fiesta for me. I'm fully confident that 2017 will be just as bad. I want to make it all end now but I'm too scared of the pain and the nothingness that will consume me once I'm gone. I'm not religious so I don't believe in an after life. Often times I wish I were, that way I'd be more inclined to just get the ""pain"" part over with and to just kill myself already. There's no real order to what I'm saying. I'm just venting I guess.

Since then I have stoped being depressed but have also stopped feeling emotion towards my situation completely, both positive, negative and even neutral emotions, I just don't feel. I have also started finding it very difficult if not downright impossible to feel empathy towards others, or any other emotion for that matter and I have been left with only logical reasoning -when I have the energy to properly think- to an extent.

But then the cycle continues... suicidal at night, okay during the day, questioning/invalidating my depression and then suicidal at night again. Other times I just feel completely numb and dissociated and as if I'm floating and living in limbo and just existing but not actually living. Does anyone experience this? How do you deal with it?",1,1
"The last few years of my life have been really difficult for me. I've been dealing with a couple sexual assaults that all happened during the last 5 years. And its just really bad timing because these past few years were supposed to be me learning how to adult and shit. So instead of learning how to cook chicken or graduate college, I've been sleeping a lot, smoking weed. Trying, failing, and succeeding at coping. Anyways. My parents do everything they can for me, but they have their own problems too and they aren't the most educated or successful people in the world (career and finances- strictly speaking). So sometimes I get a bit frustrated with them. So a couple weeks into December, and my mom tells me I have to sign up for healthcare because they are dropping me from their plan. I applied quick, but I guess since it was so close to the deadline and lots of others are doing the same, the state still hasn't followed up with me. (I was notified that I qualified, and that the next step would be to wait for a rep to contact me). My therapist will be back from vacation next week and I've been hanging on a thread without her. But I just realized that I might not be able to have an appointment with her if I don't have health insurance. So right now I'm kind of in a pre panic attack state. Typing this all out kind of helped in a weird way. Thank you for listening, I hope it makes more sense than I think it does.",1,0

I have cut out friends and some extended family because I don‚Äôt want to be hurt anymore. I isolated myself so much I am ruining my life. I have wronged others, badly. I feel terrible about that. I have stopped talking to someone who was pretty much a soul mate/twin flame..if you believe in that.. no other words to explain it. (I hate the word soul mate)Currently in a slightly toxic relationship where I am not heard and not really given the opportunity to discuss things in detail. This is because they do not have the capacity to have a deep conversation, and also their phone takes precedence over living human beings.

Do I have to 'fake' being a polite girl? I know it's because I have different cultures but I don't feel like it's myself or me.Do I really have to change myself? Do I have to stop doing this kind of attitude? What did I do wrong here? I didn't even realised when I stopped caring about anyone or anything, it just happened. Why do I feel like crying eventhough this is just me and my stubborn ego? Am I way too rough to socialize with anyone at all? I know not many people will reply to this but it would be nice if I at least know if someone feels the same way as I do.",1,0

"I am making this post mostly because for the 1st time ever somebody has called the police on me reporting that I was suicidal. I often times hit a point to where I am broke every month and I talk about wishing I could just leave earth painlessly and times where I just randomly break down because I am sick of having almost no human interaction and at the age of 30 I haven't even had so much as a girlfriend. So I am constantly questioning my worth and life based on that alone. But the cops came by my house just a couple of minutes ago and asked if I felt suicidal, and I told them no, because honestly right now I feel ""fine"". Fine in the sense that I feel I can function normally and at least for the rest of the day and probably just stay in my room and read or play random computer games. So I ask, am I even considered suicidal? While I do constantly think about what would be the repercussions of killing myself(My family kind of depends on me financially atm) I have never actually made the attempt to kill myself(Honestly just too scared I think). I'm really just curious on if I am considered suicidal or if I just need to find out how to not be a piece of shit at life.",1,1

I'm much more ready to get happy seeing something than I was, and maybe this was due to some desparation to get out of the vantablack-coated hellhole that I fell into, but slowly I started to look at life as string of vignettes, with a moment of quirky charm thrown in sporadically. I'm still far from escaping this pit, but were it not for moments like those, I'd have stopped this nonsense a long while ago. It's made me appreciate things that I've never cared about, even if moments where I truly smile are few and far in between.

I've been back half a year, got straights As, and was pretty proud of myself. The hardest part for me is that I can't find a job, even though ive tried. Holidays are over, everyone's back to their own life , and I get hit with the backlash. Saying I'm useless and lazy because I'm not a working and productive person in the world. My dad basically told me I was a loser and if I'm not working by tomorrow I'm out of the place. Being told your useless , a loser, losing your place to live, for something you are working for , is a horrible combination to hit someone struggling with anxiety and depression. This time tomorrow Ill be homeless, and I don't have basically any friends from moving back, so I have no one I can turn to now but my own head is driving me into a downward spiral . I have been doing good depression wise. Doing the right things and the next best step, but now I have lost all motivation to even open my eyes. The past 2 days have been me waking and falling asleep crying knowing tomorrow I have nothing and no one, and contemplated ending it .

I can't be around my family because I'm sick of faking my happiness, I can't be with my friends because they don't realise the extent of my depression and I always bum them out by being too anxious to say anything. While I was planning my death a month ago, I got a message from my friend telling me she's getting a house with her boyfriend and I'm invited to her party, I was so shaken up that I didn't know how to respond and said ""cool I should be able to come"". I then deeply upset her for not congratulating her and she instantly started saying I was being a bad friend. She's aware that the girl I've liked for years is attending this party with her boyfriend (which is obviously extremely uncomfortable) but she told me to suck it up for one night so she can enjoy herself but... I just can't any longer, I'm sick of pretending I'm fine for the sake of others. So in the end me and this friend have fallen out ever since and I've decided I'm not going to this party for my own sake, I get the feeling that this will upset her but I just cant endure any more of this torment. I've had 2 suicide attempts ever since this happened a month ago and I'm scared I might try again if she messages me telling me I'm a bad friend. I just can't deal with any of this any longer, I can't be what people want me to be any longer... And it's not me being a bad friend, it's me being depressed and wanting to live.",1,1
"I know for me I came to realize by my late teenage years that I have developed dual brain consciousness. What I mean is I alternate between two states at any given moment. Around friends and family I ""turn on"" my visual hemispheres. I actively look to be creative and funny and this drains my energy. When I'm alone I turn off and operate entirely on unconscious awareness. I will stare at the wall and ""recharge"" No thoughts, no feelings, like a dead man. People who caught me in the ""off mode"" have told me I have dead eyes. All of this translates to my sex life (non existent right now) But when it was active I was never able to cum inside a woman. The reason being sex is a spontaneous act. And i operate like a robot in the off or on mode. I simply can't let go like other people. This is what causes my depression. Could be autism, adhd, or any other host of illnesses. Bottom line is after 25 years I realize you can't change it hard as you try. The neural pathways planted their roots long ago. This causes me pain because all I ever want is to socialize and keep appearances like normal people",1,0

"Hello :) I want to make this short. I was never diagnosed with depression, though my mum, ex-girlfriend and best friend who lived with me told me, that they assumed I was depressed. Whether thats true or not, I think I really need help with my life. I gotta feeling that I don't do anything good with my life. I am just wasting time on the internet to distract myself. I just want to know how to start to take action. I think I know excactly what I should do to become happy and to fix my life. I collected information, made daily tasks (which are totally possible to fulfill) and want to improve many aspects of my life, though i become overwhelmed. I don't even manage to stick to my healthy eating plan. So I end up doing nothing or just a few things and waste most of my time. I need to change something drastically. So my question is: is there any trick to start taking action? Any form of mind trick? How can I motivate myself? I just need to go through some days to see the improvement and then hopefully it gets easier, but I need a start...and at the moment I feel like I am stuck in this pot of laziness, vegetating. What helped you? How did you manage to achieve this initial burst of action? Thank you so much! Every response will help me tremendously!",0,0

"So, been a long time since I posted (used throwaway but now I don't care) Basically, I was really depressed, I self harmed and attempted suicide once. After a while I decided I needed some company so I got a girlfriend. That in itself is an issue so I'll summarize it. She and I were happy but she said she was still in love with her ex. Thats when I realized I wasn't really happy with her. I broke up with her and was genuinely happy. This was about a mont and a half ago. Depression was gone and I was the best I could be. Then my friends started saying shit behind my back, that I was a fake and didn't have individuality. Basically mean things. Besides my friends were still (and still are) best friends with my ex. Like all of them.I started becoming left out. they stopped talking to me. (Literally the only chat I have with another person is my one true friend (Who doesn't respond to any of my messages even though he talks in groups) the rest I haven't had a chat since beginning of december) I keep telling myself that its okey. That I don't need them. I am probably right, But it feels really shitty. And to top it all of, my depression is coming back. I can feel it creeping up. Thanks for reading all this, You are probably the first people to care for me since vacations started. tl;dr friends ditched me, depression is coming back.",1,1
"2015 was the exact same as 2016. 2014 was the exact same as 2013. I feel like I'm in fucking limbo and I am invisible. I never get invited for things on new years. Also, nothing ever changes. Nothing in my life changes each year. I feel like I meet with the same people, do the same things, eat the same things, never get luck with romance, etc. It's all a waste of fucking time! Why waste time to celebrate the same year with the same shit as the last. I never get out of the same places, people, and situations. It's all the same. I hate it. The only thing I enjoy is getting drunk on the new years and that's it. I'm only 19 and I feel like nothing will change in my life. My life will probably be the same when I'm 30 years fucking old. Nothing exciting. Every girl rejects me that I like. Every guy rejects me that I like. No romance. Nothing. Well, good night. I hope you all had a great new years and I hope you all have a great year. I don't my own year cause I know it will be the same.",1,0
I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I haven't self harmed in a while but I want to do it so much right now. I don't know what to do. I feel so bad I just want to die.

"Joe Rogan Experience podcast with Chris Kresser. http://podcasts.joerogan.net/podcasts/chris-kresser-2 Doctors have been telling patients they are sick, while ignoring the obvious bad health effects of eating too much gluten or sugar. Your gut microbiome and brain chemistry and diet are intricately related, and the modern diet of toaster waffles, fried chicken, and bread/cake may be a major cause of many health issues. And a healthy diet has no bad side effects, unlike some medicines. This podcast episode opened my eyes to many insights and I hope everyone here can benefit from listening :) much love",0,0

Maybe they have a partner who love them, a job they find meaning in, or a couple of friends they love to be with. But my case is closed to say the least, I'm 23 Y/ M I didn't finish college, I have no career, I'm unemployable and flat broke, I have zero friends, never been in a relationship and still holding on the V card, basically I'm one of those people who has no life, your average loser worthless piece of crap, consuming food and resources just to stay alive. Add to that my severe anxiety and crippling depression, recently I started to experience physical pain cause of all the emotions trapped in my body. I spent the last 4 years in this state, I tried I really did tried to find a reason to keep on living but I can't see that things will unfold for me.

It's hard to articulate, but the best I can put it is that half the time, I feel like I'm just lying to myself and using depression as an excuse to be like this. My parents have always told me that I shouldn't even be depressed, considering how easy I have life compared to others, and as much as I hate to say it, I agree. As much as I really just want to fix everything, I feel like I just want to kill myself. But I can't do it. I don't know why, but I can't.

But even when I expressed that wish, mom still wouldn't take it more seriously and ignore it. I don't want to come to my dad crying out for help because that would just make my mom and dad argue once more, and many many more problems regarding my family might ensue.

Also, I hate people dismissing others' pain because of their age. I saw a tweet once that was like, ""If you're under 23 and claiming to be depressed, you aren't really depressed. You don't know depression until you're an adult"" or something like that, and that certainly isn't true. I knew two people, one in middle school and one in high school, that were hospitalized for weeks from suicide attempts.

"Hey can any of you all relate to this? I‚Äôm 22 year old male . My Parents divorced when I was 13.

The day they divorced, police had to come to the house because my dad was trying to hurt my mom. Soon after I witnessed my younger brother change from an innocent child to a drug addict.

"I'm a girl in my mid twenties who has two friends, a job that's steadily decreasing my hours, no car, and no real hobbies. I've struggled between keeping myself entertained, keeping my depression at bay, and balancing my anxiety with my attempts at socialization. But I feel like no matter what I do, I always end up feeling alone. I used to be parts of groups, used to make friends in school, used to have things to do outside the house. But now I feel like I'm going through the motions of each day and not taking anything away from them. The worst part is feeling alone when I'm surrounded by people. I was out just two days ago and almost immediately wanted to head home. I've always considered myself an extrovert but lately I've found it hard to connect with people. Even in my own home, where I have a few roommates, I feel like nothing I do to interact with them is ever enough. One of them is obsessed with his video games, one is barely ever home, and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that I always feel like I'm bothering her when I try to hang out. And now the icing on the cake is last minute cancelation of our New Years plans (for valid reasons), but then instead of the four of us watching the ball drop together, everyone went to bed early leaving me yet again alone. Now I'm ringing in the New Year crying and writing this down, hoping if I make sense of my crippling loneliness, then there's hope in 2017 I can do something about it.",1,0

"For my entire life, I've been a little off on the inside. I feel like I have felt everything. I had deja vu all the time when I was a bit younger, like I had already seen everything. This grew into anger and hatred for non-original thought. I see it as people thinking that they say original things, but in my mind, it makes me extremely frustrated. A little while ago, I started watching anime, primarily moe content. This woke something in me, and it wasn't good. It left me with very high standards and expectations of females, both physically and in terms of personality. Lately I've been seeing all girls around me as unimpressive, and I desire something more. At this point, I was on the verge of depression. I'm seeing everyone as inferior and not worth spending time with. This is strange for me, because for my whole life I've loved others and felt extreme empathy and compassion for everyone. So here I am, with high standards, irritable, possibly depressed, lonely, confused and wrathful. Now, another unreasonable standard in finding a female my age (16) approaches. I have developed a desire to be obsessed over. To the point where she'd hurt herself for me. I'd feel immensely sorry afterwards, but I'd still make her do it again. (Sick I know...) I don't know if I want the feeling of being the hero or what, but this has become somewhat of a must for me... I've read a lot of 'help', nobody feels the way I do.

I'm anxious all the time and don't know how to control this, anxious about the smallest things that other people do each day with ease. Taking a train or a plane can trigger anxiety days and days before and make me feel so low. These feelings I cannot control and really wish I could. I came off my anti-depressants last year and now I'm thinking of going back on them but really don't want to. All the time I feel I'm going round and round in circles with such a heavy load!! Does anyone have any ways of dealing with such feelings?",1,0
"Ive been very socially withdrawn throughout my teens. My depression usually gets its worst when I have time off of work (I have a restaurant job where I interact with over 100 people a day). I was put on adderall when I was younger, because i talked my way into an ADD diagnosis even though I know it was due tp my social withdrawal and depression that I just had no motivation. I became an asshole to the few friends I had left. And now I have one friend left. I really have no motivation and feel hopeless. Im 18 and ive been like this since I was around 12.

"I've been depressed for more than a year now, I am a teenager and self-diagnosed but I'm absolutely sure what I've been going through is depression. I confessed to my mother I was depressed once and she felt really awful, asking what she did wrong and it made me feel terribly guilty... so when she asked if I needed to be on medication and get professional help, I lied and said no so she wouldn't feel bad. Anyways, I've been going through these periods where I feel really good. Most of the time I'm content and sometimes I even feel happy. It lasts for a little while, last time for almost a month, and then I start slipping again.

"As the title suggests I could really use some advice. I‚Äôve been struggling with depression for years, with this latest episode affecting me since mid-November. It is now January 2018 and although I‚Äôve had some good times and didn‚Äôt really feel depressed over the Holidays, it all just came flooding back last night. All of my friends ended up bailing on me on New Years so I spent the night alone in my room until I fell asleep around 9 pm. I woke up around 3 in the morning and stupidly checked my phone. When I did I saw all the friends that bailed on me at different parties, surrounded by others, having fun. This sent me spiraling back into depression and I found myself close to ending my life with a belt which I‚Äôve read can be very painless. I was able to take some medication that helped me go to sleep again and get through the night. It‚Äôs now 1:30 in the afternoon and I still feel the same way with absolutely nobody to talk to about this because I don‚Äôt want to be that person that brings somebody down on New Years. It just feels as if no matter what medications I take, whatever therapist I have, and even with these group therapy sessions I‚Äôve been attending, I always end up back on the train to death. It‚Äôs starting to feel like the only solution as I‚Äôve tried making some major changes in my life and none of them have made any impact when others have told me they would. Thank you for reading and any advice would be greatly appreciated. -A",1,1
"Hi! I was previously on 80 mg of Prozac and it helped a little with regulating my mood, but then I think my anxiety got worse because I started having trouble staying asleep and my problems with concentration got even worse. My doctor started me on a 5-week cross-tapering plan to switch to Zoloft, and I am currently on day 2 of week 3 where I take 20 mg of Prozac and 50 mg of Zoloft. Today, however, I suddenly experienced diarrhea and really bad nausea for the first time. Has anyone had similar experiences and does anyone have any tips?",0,0

I'm a burden, and my parents refuse therapy because it costs money and all they care about is money and my grades. They as well dont believe in mental issues. I've always been too much of a pussy to consider hurting myself, let alone, ending myself. I know I wont have a future, so why bother with going onward? I'm banal, a dead weight. I've done nothing remarkable nor contributable. If I do kill myself my parents will blame it on 'the liberal school system brainwashing me' or some shit. I just want everything to go numb forever.

Maybe depression is just a name created by people who are too scared of what reality is like. What if depression is perceiving the world as it is, while having good mental health means to disctract oneself from others pain? Or maybe I'm just talking shit, I don't even know what is real at this point. Fuck everything.",1,0

I've been told I'm a pretty good looking guy. I've had a few women over the last year, but only one really stuck out. I met this woman over a month ago and we kicked it off really quickly.

I'm starting to feel very hollow. I feel like this isn't normal considering I only knew this woman for 2.5 weeks, but I just can't seem to shake this funk I'm in. What is going on here?

"She saw it in her mind's eye like a movie playing, the haunting memories from her childhood she couldn't seem to shake blending together into one raw, aching image. Her mother lying in a darkened room for days, her face swollen with tears. The inevitable ashtray overrun with ashes, the acrid scent of pot smoke in the air. The bed or couch or futon may have been different from year to year as Evie moved them around from apartment to commune to funky cottage, but her mother was always the same. Falling hard for some man, immersing herself in romantic fantasies that were crushed when the guy left. And the guy always left. Her mother's inability to get a grasp on reality had too often left Mischa to care for her younger sister, to care for her mother, from too young an age. She remembered shaking Evie awake, trying to get her to eat. To get up and take a shower, take her and Raine to school. No kid should have to do that.

"New Year's Day. What a way to start the year, right?

I got out of the car with just some whiplash and some bruises but I'm fine otherwise. It's a miracle I'm alive right now. I spun out on the freeway going 75 mph. I got hit by another car. The witnesses and patrol officer and the EMT all expected me to be unconscious or way more badly hurt than I was. I don't believe in God, but I do think there was a greater force at work, telling me to stop fantasizing about something so horrible and to get my shit together. So I'm going to. Phone calls give me anxiety, I know I'm going to have a bout of PTSD related to driving, I'm going to feel guilty about wrecking my parents' car, but I'm okay. Everything is okay.

"Depression it‚Äôs a bitch. Its like there is a constant voice in your head telling you that you are worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, a disappointment that you don‚Äôt deserve happiness or to be alive but to only feel pain. It makes you feel like you are forever trapped in an abyss with no way of crawling out. Sometimes you can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it always drags you back deeper than you‚Äôve gone before and the impossible cycle of escaping begins again. No matter how much you try to escape the darkness, your brain yearns for the dark thoughts to return because it happens so frequently that it becomes the comfort zone for it. You begin to doubt everything about yourself; telling yourself whatever you do isn‚Äôt good enough and you should just stop trying or its worthless to just go on and might be better to just end it all. You feel like you are nothing and will be important to anyone ever and when you are gone everyone will be happier knowing the pathetic failure that they once knew will be gone forever and can no longer fuck up their lives. All the smiles on the outside is just a mask to cover how you really feel. You cut because you feel like you deserve the sharp stinging sensation as the blade cuts your arm open and the blood slowing oozing out.

So I'm kind of just looking for a creative outlet to let out my sadness and depression, so I have like three ideas for it. One of my major ways of coping with depression is joking about it, it has become a really good coping strategy believe it or not.

"hello. i really cannot hang on anymore. i have been genuinely contemplating suicide since i was in 7th grade (currently a senior in high school) and tonight has been really tough. first off, i have been to school 2/8 of the past days it has been in session. i have a metric fuckton of homework to catch up on that i really have no motivation to do. my mom has been having problems with her legs and compulsive picking for years but it has totally came to a head recently. backstory: she got sprayed with raw sewage a couple of months ago due a plumber trying to install our washer in some piece of shit landlord's apartment. she has worms coming out of the scabs. i thought she was legitimately developing some kind of hallucinogenic disorder but i saw them. with my own two eyes. she forced me to see them. it was awful. she still hasn't gone to the hospital, my dad is pressuring her to push it off. all of the adult figures i have that once believed in me (all at school [teachers] due to how unstable my parents are) are genuinely disappointed with me. my friends have barely reached out to me. when they do i can tell how annoyed they are that i am struggling. i feel like it would be so much easier for me to die. maybe it would prevent other suicides, they're ignoring SO many red flags. i just want the pain to stop. please god or whatever is out there help me.",1,1

"Hello. So I would like to preface this by saying that I have not been formally diagnosed with depression, but I figured this subreddit would be the best place to seek advice nevertheless. I hope you don't mind me. For a while now I have not been able find the motivation to do much of anything. When I have a break from school I mindlessly click through useless videos on Youtube or various useless articles. Virtually nothing holds my attention. I can't get through an episode of a tv show without reading something else. I can't read through interesting articles, I can't finish any books, I can't draw, I can't do any research or even clean my room. Essentially, I can't accomplish anything unless it pertains to a greater purpose than simply enjoyment, or if I have made myself accountable to someone else, and even then I have trouble finishing tasks. It was honestly difficult for me to get out of bed and shower for the past couple of days. I am on winter break currently. What makes me the most afraid is that I haven't been thinking-- especially thinking creatively. If I have a new idea to ponder, I never pursue it. I used to constantly be thinking of new art projects and writing prompts, even though they never came to fruition. In school, I am ridiculously bored. I am lucky if I pay attention for ten minutes straight in any of my classes. My grades are fine, however. Could I have some advice, please? I am saddest about my lack of curiosity. Even when there was nothing interesting to do, I always had my imagination, and now I am bored with my own mind. Anything you can say to help would be greatly appreciated.",0,0

This is arguably worse because at least I can work on my physical appearance to a degree. I try so hard to be there for people, try to be a good friend, etc. But eventually everyone just drops me anyway. I can't be myself around people because who I really am is a depressed, negative, pessimistic, hopeless, self loathing piece of shit. I can't help it, this is what you become when life and people shit all over you for years on end. So I try to be more positive, but I have to fake it because I'm naturally a depressing downer. I don't know what it is but people don't seem to ever want to stick around in my life. It seems like everyone just eventually vanishes into thin air and stops talking to me all of a sudden. This goes for relationships but it also applies to some friendships that I mistakenly believed were very close. People don't like the real me but they don't seem to like the fake me either so I have no idea what to do with myself.",1,0

I'm worse off than I've been in a long time, and attempted suicide 4 times in the past 3 months, ending up with two hospitalizations and being committed to behavioral center. The only thing that kept me from attempting tonight is a fear of failure, ending up back in a hospital, and the fact that I now live with my parents again. I guess the fact that at some point last year I didn't want to die made me hesitant to follow through with my promise, but honestly I hate that I didn't.

Whenever I think about my life, I always feel so out of control. I had no choice in my existence. Everyday life without my distractions of fantasy..through games and TV shows..is meaningless and awful, yet I must participate to keep consuming the media that I truly live for. I work and get education in an exhausting cycle every day..for an uncertain future in a VERY fucked up and disgusting world in light of recent events. How do I cope with the feelings of dread that wash over me? I guess I'll try to answer for myself. I just keep distracting, keep consuming media that gives my life interest and purpose. Yet, as of late even that hasn't been enough. I need the bigger distraction of other people I guess. I want to socialize and build relationships to strengthen my life's meaning, but this is really, REALLY fucking hard. Reaching out to people in today's American society is like jumping off a bridge in which you'll land on your feet or face first. As an American, superficial and acquaintance relationships dominate. The real struggle is to create something more. I'm really afraid that my exhaustion will soon outweigh my desire to consume more media and the relationships I have by the time I have my BA degree.

He had been taking 10mg every night for years but about 2 months ago he started taking 20mg every night (2 of the 10mg tabs). His doctor said this was fine and last month he filled a prescription for the 20mg tablets which he's been taking since. Now, for the past week and a half, he's been feeling very emotional and out of control and the past 3 or 4 days he just can't stop crying, even at work. Every little thing upsets him to the point of tears and when he talks, he almost sounds like he's drunk. Of course, him being so emotional, he won't go to the doctor because he feels like it would be wasting the doctor's time. I was just curious if anybody here has had this happen or heard of this happening? Either with dose increases or changing strength of the actual tablet?",0,0

"I guess this isn‚Äôt really a stereotype, but I often see depressed people in movies/shows/etc portrayed as a person fighting their depression alone, meanwhile trying to make everyone else in their life happy so they‚Äôll never experience that sadness.

I hate other people‚Äôs happiness, when someone accomplishes something all I do is think about my failures. I obviously am outwardly supportive, but inside I‚Äôm so resentful. I feel like am truly an awful person, I don‚Äôt remember the last time I was genuinely happy for someone. I really just cannot connect with people on any emotional level anymore.

And I remembered that all those years ago, music was life. For a brief moment, I remembered what it was like to feel. For real music, honest music, you have to be able to feel. I remembered that I would drift through the day back then so numb to the world, but when I got home, plugged up to the amp, and put on my 100 dollar studio quality headphones and magically I could feel. I wanted to remember that, so it's just what I did. Been a *long* time so I had to do some digging, and almost got stuck in the memories held by all the crap in storage, but I found it. The main volume dial needs to be replaced, and I had to rewire the speaker to the amp, but it all still works. And I played.

I feel so ashamed to have these feelings yet so jealous of the happiness and enjoyment my friends have in the things we do. Because of this I feel isolated and alone in my feelings and unsure of my future. I love my friends and family but I‚Äôve never seen them as the type of people to have serious conversations about my distress with and I don‚Äôt want their perception of me to change if I tell them. I‚Äôve had people in my life call me broken and recently I‚Äôve started to feel that way. How do I become enjoy life again?

Yea. I‚Äôm ready for the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just a kid‚Äù. Idgaf. I want to go. My mind and body is screaming for a way out of this fucking horrible mindset of myn. Im a dumbfucking stoner with a stepdad who literally makes me fear to go downstairs. I sit in my room all day and hope that I just fucking die. My mom Dosent fucking care jack shit about me. My step dad gets pissed off over nothing. And leaves for 8 months. And I swear by this saying those 8 months are the happiest months I ever have. My stepfather almost choked his father out when he was 16 and said he wishes he did it. Which makes me scared to say anything to him. My mother knows I don‚Äôt like him and don‚Äôt like being near him but she Dosent care. I was bullied for nearly my whole elementary school years and I was having suicidal thought from the start of grade 3 or 4. And that‚Äôs just not okay in the eyes of anybody. I currently just took 10 pills and hoping I black out. I have one friend. Who I made when I was forced to move back to my old house. Him and I bonded over stupid and racist shit. And now he‚Äôs like a brother to me. I wish he didn‚Äôt have to put up with my bullshit. I love him like a brother and all. But I feel that he would get over it soon enough.

"The summer of 2019 I started developing severe OCD after suffering from mild, unnoticeable OCD for many years. I just feel so tired of things, so bored of living, but I can't commit suicide. I know that there are people who care about about me, like my parents, and the shit they would have to go trough if I commited suicide is unbearable for me to imagine. But I just wished I didn't exist, that I never was born. I wish I could vanish from this world, be gone like the wind. I often wish I would die in an accident or disease, because maybe that would be less painful for the people around me then if I would commit suicide. I have stayed home from school for about 2 months because of illness related to the stress, not stress from school, but from my mental health. I feel crippled. One day I woke up and was completely emotionally numb. I couldn't feel happiness, sadness, anger or any other emotion, but it got better. But I really wished it wouldn't have gotten better, it was ""amazing"", I couldn't either feel anxiety so all I felt was blank. When I think about the meaning of life I always come to the conclusion that I want to marry a wonderful woman, have kids and grow old and die of old age, and this is the other thing keeping me alive.

"holy shit things went bad fast. Last year I went into deep depression, however I recovered over the summer and things were seemingly looking up. I got a job, my grades were good and was hanging out with friends regularly. However the past two weeks things have went to absolute shit. My parents decided they wanted to try some ""parenting"" and decided I spent ""too much time on video games"". Even though I really only played 1-2 hours a night. It was one of the main ways I interacted with my friends as well. After that they decided that my phone was distracting me so it was confiscated as soon as I got home from school. Then they decided to take my door off the hinges to look in on me more. The worst part is i don't even know why they are doing all of this. My grades were good, A's and B's and in 6 AP classes while working 20 hours a week and maintaining a social life. Everything was going so good. Now I get home and feel empty and alone.

Then today she wrote me that she won't attend the dancing courses with me out of consideration for her boyfriend. Yes, be considerate of your boyfriend, who cares about ugly useless me. It's like Fate telling me: ""Don't even bother trying. You're too ugly to be with anyone else. You think a new year changes anything? You're going to be alone forever, get used to it!""",1,0
"I cant stand it, I dont wanna kill myself I just really hope and pray that a car runs me the fuck over or some ribs me at gunpoint so i can ask them to just fucking shoot me. And my mother doesn't seem to get that, shes pulling the ""your depressed, I know I was depressed, I know what your going through"". Sue doesn't get it... I'm not depressed I'm fucking suicidal and I find it so god damn hard to find a singular reason to keep living in this world. I lost my job because I have no will or motivation to go to sleep or get up when I finally do. I lost my job because of this.",0,1
The title says it all my anxiety stopped me from going down a small waterslide and yet I have the drive and courage to kill myself there must really be something fucking wrong with me,0,1
"With the new year starting tomorrow and me being introverted. I'm confused on what do to tonight. I feel very alone around the holidays and try to make an effort to be with people because if I don't then I start a pattern of self-deprecation and self-hate and thoughts of suicide start to creep in. My parents and brother are going to a friend's house (two of my former teachers) to ""have a good time of fellowship"" and blast fireworks at midnight. Totally sober. They want me there. I plan on drinking tonight and it would not be allowed for me to drink around my parents and their friends or my brother. I have a friend that I went to high school with and we are good friends, like the type where we can go without talking or seeing each other for months but when we see each other we're still good friends. She kind of invited me over to her boyfriend's house for tonight. He works for a beer distribution center and has loads of beer. They smoke weed and have also told me about times when they've done cocaine. I want to spend time with my friend but I don't want to partake in smoking or snorting tonight. I think I have an addictive personality and cocaine might not be a good thing for me to try. Also i really don't want to get crossfaded. I'm not really sure if I should go to her boyfriend's house. It seems like I only have a couple options, be stone sober with boring people and watch fireworks, be drunk with a friend and her boyfriend where coke might be available, or sit at home with my own stash of booze and bring in the new year alone.",1,1
"So every so often I have an episode of an anexity attack followed my depression. I had an anexity attack last night and today I've just felt disconnected. It really sucks because my life is so together. I'm doing my degree, have lots of friends, actually right now I'm with my family for the holidays so I can't understand why this is happening now. It makes me really just want to cry, I feel like everytime this happens I slip further into it and one day I'm going to be consumed completely by it. How do I get out of this cycle?

I'm having such a hard time dealing with lack of focus in my entire life. It makes me feel like garbage and a waste of space to grace this planet. I swear everyone around me has passions and potential and a drive to succeed in one area or another yet I have taken such a long time to come to terms with myself and its still not there! I'm surrounded by confidence and go getters and i know deep down that i could go and try and do all of these things that i want to experience but when push comes to shove i find it impossible to justify it or sometimes even remember what it was i wanted to do. This lack of passion for life gets me down every bloody day and I just want it to go away so that i can become comfortable with myself and have an casual epiphany that will allow me to move on a get on with my life.,0,0
"So I don‚Äôt know for sure that I am depressed, but it really does feel like it. I dont feel loved or cared about. Like I‚Äôm not special, I‚Äôm nobody‚Äôs favorite person.

I *did* when I had the ""luxury"" of health insurance. I'm on my own now, though, and am doing my fucking best. It felt like it came out of nowhere, too, when he initiated the call and wanted to hear me participate more in voice with group chats. I'd made jokes about needing time to remember how to speak after so much tension with family, and think he may have gotten the wrong impression. He started offering new employment routes, which, while appreciated, also just overwhelmed me even more. I'd already told him that I technically have two businesses, one teaching guitar and the other gardening. He was offering stuff completely unrelated and out of my field. I'd like to look into them, but I have multiple learning disabilities and mental illnesses over here.

"Started a self defense class in November. Have gone 2 times. Took 3 weeks off. They probably think it's for the holidays but I was sick. I hate the class. I feel inept and like a complete dumb ass but one kid gave me some respect and shook my hand so that felt good. It's mostly guys in there so I feel like there's less of the fakeness you would get from women. I think I would like the class if I were good at it and felt like I fit in better, but I'm completely self-conscious and I suck at some of the moves they teach us. I got owned by a couple teenagers the first week I went, made me feel like crap. I've never been much into sports. I deeply wish that someone would've taken time out of their day to help me understand sports or develop my athleticism but no one did. This kinda feels the way church used to. The longer I would skip out on church, the less likely I would be to go back and the more guilty I would feel. I do have other stuff to do. I think I'm about to lose my job so I could apply for jobs, I could play video games, I could learn how football works, workout... This class is just so damn far out of my comfort zone.

"Hi all fellow friends who are suffering from depression! I have IBS, suffer from sleep paralysis almost every single night, be a paranoiac. To add to that, I had bone fractures which forced me to go through 2 painful surgeries over the span of 3 years (the first one to add a fixation device to my bone and the second one to remove it). The amount of antibiotics and painkillers I used only makes all the symptoms I have much worse. Sometimes I feel like I am the most unfortunate person in this world. And as a result, the fact that I have all these symptoms in my 20s when all my friends around me are super healthy makes me suffer from depression as well. Things have been hard for me for a few years. I don't want to go out and meet strangers and spend most of my time in my room. However, a new year has come and I am determined to regain control over my life. I don't want to give in to these diseases that easily. I am too young and I have to support my family as well. I have maintained a habit doing exercises everyday for 2 weeks (running and hitting the gym). Now I want to start reading to understand more about all the aspects of mental health. I would be much grateful if you guys can recommend any books you think would be of great help to a person fighting mental illness. Tks for reading and sharing!",1,0
"So like many of us, I've suffered from anxiety and depression for my entire adult life. Pretty severe depression to be honest. About 5 years ago I started taking Celexa under my general practitioners recommendation , and it was incredible. It made a huge difference in every way possible and it was like I was a new person. Eventually I (stupidly) weaned off it, thinking I was ""cured"" and went for about 2 ish years not on any meds. Eventually I predictably fell back into my depression. Went back to the doctor. We tried celexa again- didn't work. wasn't anything like the first time. then put me on wellbutrin- didn't really work either. then we finally tried effexor- same deal, didn't notice any positive changes. I don't exactly remember but I believe we also tried upping the dosages of these meds also. i'm getting increasingly frustrated and unsure of what to do. i've been struggling finding the right meds now for years. I would give anything to go back to that ""clear, happy"" feeling I got from my first batch of celexa. but i've not been able to find it. does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions for me? what is the next step? any other meds that I might recommend to my doctor to try next?",0,0

"Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out. I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug? Thanks TLDR: Scared of the sexual side effects of Celexa, any positive experiences to ease my worry?",0,0

"Hi guys, long time reader first time poster here. A year ago I moved into an apartment in a brand new city. I remember being so excited for all the things I'd be able to do. I'd get a job, get to a gym membership, and even join a few social groups. Well, after a year, nothings really changed. I applied for a lot of jobs and ended up going to a decent number of interviews. Nothing ever came of them and after June passed me by I lost my nerve to even really look anymore. I did end up getting a gym membership but I've never really used it though. I know I shouldn't procrastinate like this but I'm never able to find the energy. I haven't been able to find any groups or friends while I've been here either. I've looked but the only groups I've been able to find have been smaller groups that cater to people a lot older than I am.

It feels so nice to have someone actually understand me for once, and understand what's happening, and how my situation is.

"I've felt proud of my success in overcoming most of my depression in 2016, and at least making some progress in seeing most people as good. But the end of this year has really taken a toll on me, especially after the election. It's not because of who people voted for, but because of all the horrible things on the Internet that resulted from it! I've always taken comments a little more seriously than most, but why not? If people express what they're really thinking on the Internet, than how can you trust anyone? How many people are friends with another race, then talk s*** about them online? How many people lack empathy for others? How many people condemn others for trying to speak out against hate? How many people really care? Despite thinking all this, I've still resolved to being a kind person and trying to understand others, even if their way of thinking is unfathomable to me. But i don't know if i can keep up the faith if this is how people really think. I just want people to be caring, but i know it's not as simple as that. I thought i was getting better, but i just don't trust people anymore. It doesn't seem like anyone really cares.",0,0
"Hello, happy new year etc, etc. Not sure if anyone will read this but I'll write anyway. I've been feeling so darn depressed for the past years and it has gotten so much worse lately. I only eat and sleep, like, all day.I have nightmares every time I try to sleep, and I wake up feeling like shit. I got so much to study and I've fallen behind. I feel so empty and no matter how much I've tried to give my life some meaning, it all feels so pointless. I'm sick of waking up, I'm sick of breathing, I'm sick of being here. I haven't been diagnosed with any kind of mental illness, basically because I avoid talking to people about how I feel. (Can't afford a therapist either). However, I don't know if a diagnosis would matter. Because I kind of feel helpless and I really feel like it doesn't even fucking matter if some prof in a coat tell me ""oh hey something is wrong with your head"". (no shit man) This feels so overwhelming, and dealing with it seems impossible. I've talked to some of the people around me, but most of them are the kind of people that like memes about mental Illnesses, so their reactions were like ""Oh I'm depressed too haha"" , or ""You have nightmares? Welcome to the club"", ""you're suicidal? Cool me too!"". Reactions by the same people who said they don't want to die because they have things they want to do.(Don't get me wrong, I love my friends) As for my family, they call my childish and say I have no reason to be depressed.

This year, I have a terminally ill family member and I'm struggling to find a place to live as I'm being kicked out of my old place. This is compounded by the fact that the city I work in has no available apartments at the start of Jan/Feb. The next closest city is about 100km away (an 1 hour+ drive). I've no idea what to do anymore. Every day I wake up feeling sicker and sicker, my head is just full of clouds, I can't find my knife that I usually use to relieve the pressure (I suspect one of my friends stole it once they realized what it was for). I'd ask for a hug, but I'm terrified of contact with people and it would just make me feel worse. It feels like there's a noise in my head that's just getting louder and louder, like someone turning up the volume on a TV station that's nothing but static. People keep telling me how impressed they are by how smart I am, but I only look smart compared to those who don't actively reject everything that's supposed to make them feel like a person. Academic medals mean nothing to someone who isn't human. TL;DR: I'm an empty shell and cracks are forming along the hull.",1,0
"Every year it seems something goes wrong or I'm alone on my birthday. In my twenties it feels like it's such a mundane thing to be upset over not having a good birthday. But I would just like one day where I can be happy, maybe even celebrate a little, because every other day the pit of self-loathing and misery gets a little bigger. I'd like to be able to spend it with friends that actually care about me, that put in more effort than the people you only hear from once a year when they post an apathetic ""happy birthday"" to your feed. I never realized how much not having friends could affect your mental state until I lost the ones I had. I should be happy today, I should be having fun, but instead I've withdrawn to inattentively watch Hulu while I keep thinking of everything I'd like to be able to share with a friend.",1,0

I am loading the bullet and not caring for what anyone thinks. I don't care for life anymore. I am accepting my fate.

Cold and sad makes me feel happy. I have lost interest in friends, activities and prefer to be alone. I am a sad and pathetic human being and wanted to say goodbye to the ones I cared about which is practically 0. I am a loser that hangs myself with a guitar string and is bullied daily.

"2017 was rough. My brain fell into cycles of self degradation way too easily, this led me down a spiral this year which made me end a long relationship, lose some friends, and made me put duties that would have helped me to the wayside like taking my dog out. The past few months leading to now has been anti social to say the least. I stopped trying to make plans with friends as I was tired of hearing no, my friends clearly didn't want me around a whole lot (since September I had a total of 2 outings with friends, pre September we spent probably too much time together at ~6 days a week). On top of that another good friend of mine moved away indefinitely. 2017 I realized I can't rely on my friends the way I thought I could, I wish I could but life doesn't work like that. My New Years resolution this year is to not base my happiness and social success around if my friends and I are having fun. I've realized I don't need my friends to go play an open Mic night, or go see a movie, or to go for a hike, in fact a lot of these are better done alone. 2017 my friends left me high and dry 2018 they're not gonna be able to",1,0
"Over the past year I've lost the majority of my friends. It started off with a health issue that I obviously couldn't prevent, which somehow made me lose most of my friends in high school. I then thought I was alright as I still had a couple of very close friends. I was outgoing, and some other people still seemed to like me. But almost immediately after graduation everyone stopped talking to me. And now in college I still feel so upset and bitter about my high school experience that I don't know how to open up to new people. I'm quiet, introverted, and can't connect with the people I meet. I've met a ton of seemingly great people that right after meeting me escaped becoming my friend. So now I'm lonely in college, my depression is creeping back up after years of carefree happiness, and I've taken to the Internet and video games as my safe place. It's a life that's depressing, but I hope that one day I'll stop feeling so numb and alone. One of my closest friends recently just stopped talking to me. We used to play xbox all the time together. Now she hardly answers my texts, giving the simple ""busy"" excuse. I've spent too much time trying to be supportive and loving when other people won't give me a minute of their own time. This is only one example of why I've become only a ghost of my typical self. I guess, has anyone ever dealt with this? Are you dealing with this now? These types of things only seem to happen to people with depression and other mental illness, which is one of the cruelest things imo.",1,0

He's an excellent listener and an interesting guy, I've texted him and he's texted me since then. Sometimes I tell him about my depression and my eating disorder, and how awful I feel. He listens patiently, gives sympathy, and makes some suggestions without being presumptuous. But he never tells me about his life. Even if I ask. He has never tried to share any of his own problems with me. Ever. It was even like this when I was still dating him. When he texts me first, it's to ask how I'm doing. Any time I get quiet for a while, he stops contacting me. Even for months at a time. Then when I come back again, crying about my own problems, he's there to listen. Patiently. It's obvious I'm not his friend. He tells me he's glad we met. But he only talks to me for my benefit. He's doing a good deed.

"When daydreaming my mind brings up negative memories. In any situation, in any location my mind will simply wander and bring up pessimistic memories instantly. I'll often be left pondering ""why did I do that?"" - ""why did I say that?"". These will often be memories or sort of quick snapshots of uneasy moments in my life that will flash through my psyche as soon as I have a spare moment. It's happened on the train, when at work and socialising with friends. The odd thing is that the memories vary in date - it could be something I said last week, to something I did at a party when I was like five years old. The underlying factor is that all of these memories will have negative associations and will leave me questioning my actions, thoughts and responses at the time. It seems as though I have no control over what memories or images appear - I have been overheard saying ""How can I even remember that!"" when peculiar or seemingly distant images re-appear.

Now I could write such grand things here like: - Every choice we make will in some way lead to pain. - The human condition is a curse. - If I have nothing to look forward to in the present or the future and there is no afterlife, what am I supposed to work towards? but the bottom line is that I feel sad and angry about how I am currently living my life and I have no intention of changing it because I don't want to or as I would rather put it to make myself feel better: - Because I see no reason to. - Because nothing will change for the better even if I try. - other stupid excuses like the ones above.

I have never felt as happy to be alive as when I was with him.

I also can't seem to get booked for any shows (playing music). I've struggled with depression &amp; anxiety my whole life, but never like this. I don't know what to do.

"I am currently in my friend's restroom breaking down for the last ~30 minutes. Aplogies for the wall of text. In the eyes of many, I am sure my life is fine. I am moderately attractive with a relatively outgoing personality and decent intelligence. I get lucky with some thing and have the best friend group someone could ask for. Yet despite all this, I still am overwhelemed with depression. To preface, my depression is sometimes caused by outlying causes, but mostly seems to manifest randomly whenever it wants to. I graduated in 2010 with high expectations from my folks. Nothing too crazy, but significantly better than I performed. With depression and anxiety, I have skipped on many of the opportunities in life (fun, women, careers, etc) and can't seem to truly overcome it entirely. I trick myself into believing it is gone for periods of time, but it inevitably comes back harder than the times previous. I now am sitting in 2018 having accomplished little outside of making a good friend group, and while having gone into business with a close friend, feel like I am the weak partner. Ultimately my whole life feels like I squandered it and wasted myself when others could've capitalized and lived a happy, fruitful life while my depression and anxiety rules who I am to this day. Frankly, I don't feel deserving of the opportunities I have recieved, regardless of any good I have done. I know it's stupid for someone in my situation to feel this way with so much good in life compared to most others in this subreddit and elsewhere, so i'm sorry. Hope you all have a good year.",1,0

Against all the odds, I managed to befriend two great guys, one with an incredibly positive posture and one that shares my pain. I've been thinking a lot, as always.. and maybe things can change now. I am changing habits, thinking stuff through and making solid routines. Maybe I'm not such a waste of space. What I mean is, I've been there. And even though it seems like the cause of the suffering will never go away... There is a way to cope with it. In a healthy way. Maybe you are right that nobody can change your mind about your existential crisis. If God doesn't exist, then there is no right or wrong etc, etc. I still haven't changed my mind. But maybe, just maybe, I can still be happy. I guess this was just a vent or something. I don't know.

Last night though at first I was fine and everything was cool but it got to just after midnight and I got this overwhelming feeling that I should leave.

My mood had slightly picked up before we went out but once we were there I just couldn't escape what I was feeling. My girlfriend was naturally really upset and couldn't understand why I wanted to leave. After having a bit of a row I just yelled ""It's because I'm fucking depressed!"" and left by myself. I have feelings of guilt - obviously I know she wanted me there but I let this mood I'm having control what I do. It must have looked strange to everyone and I feel like I wasted the night and an opportunity to have fun. Having said that the feeling I had making me want to leave was so overwhelming I wouldn't have enjoyed myself at all. This scares me - this hasn't happened before, I am usually a sociable person and enjoy having fun with my friends.

"I've talked with her for over a year. I developed feelings for her I haven't developed for anyone else ever. but recently she said she moved on, which I assumed was just her going through an episode that her many mental illnesses can bring out. But today I found out she's dating someone who makes YouTube commentary videos. The worst part about it is their relationship is long distance. She told me the only reason her and I never dated officially and stayed together was because she couldn't handle long distance relationships. but yet this dickhead is farther away than I was. I was always there and I poured my heart and soul into her so she'd be happy. I just don't understand why I'm not good enough. Where I went wrong I'm fine with dying tonight. I prayed to god or jesus or whoever to kill me in my sleep tonight. I begged for it. If we had hard alcohol or crazy pills at the house I'd down those.

"Whatsup... I'm 22. I haven't been *depressed* For my entire life... I can think of times when I have been extremely happily (mainly middle school), and very functional despite having mild depression, such as in highschool (prior state ranked athlete), but I was wondering if people with major depression (such as myself) or bipolar disorder, or even other mental illnesses are living in a constant genetic predisposition to depression, in which (when they're off medication), their mind/thoughts/senses are always in a strings length of a depressive episode. For instance, picture an Instagram filter than is dark and bleak. I have always been a dark/unlively person and I learned to find bliss and stress reduction in my seemingly cloudy lifestyle/outlook. My ""happy"" emotions are mainly nostalgia and excitement. Like i said, i have been happy at certain points in my life, but i still always have that ""filter""... And sometimes I take solace in it.

"So the best I have ever felt while on antidepressants is for like 2 or 3 days after starting (didn't feel like sleeping for ever, had some evergy, had some motivation). Then as the medication levels out I feel like crap again. This has only happened with 2 meds that I recall: cymbalta, an SNRI, and wellbutrin. The same thing happened when my doc increased the cymbalta dose. So what I am asking is can anyone explain this? The only logical thing I can come up with is placebo effect because you should maybe start to feel better after 4-6 weeks but I only seem to get better for 48-72 hours and then go back to feeling the same as before that. But if it was placebo, why has it only done that with those 2 medications? The only other thing I can think of is that I have a different underlying condition that keeps counter acting the meds, but I feel like I'm just grasping at straws, but I'm sick of trying medications and the only relief I get is not wanting to die 24/7.

"I'm a mid-20s woman with rapid-cycling bipolar II but I'm posting here because I'm asking about antidepressants and how to control my depressive episodes. My moods were under control when I was on lithium and zoloft, but the zoloft (50 mg, so not much) absolutely ZAPPED my sex drive. I would force myself to do it to please my partner (no, he did not coerce me). Aside from that, I felt the best I'd ever felt. No complaints otherwise. Last June, I went off the zoloft and stuck with the lithium and felt fine, but I felt some depression symptoms coming back after a couple months. My anxiety and reactivity increased, but I was still WAY better off than with no meds whatsoever. In December, my psychiatrist recommended an NDRI to help prevent a change in libido. I started wellbutrin (100 mg so again, not much) and it was definitely helping, but now I'm feeling some depression symptoms coming back again. I have spent the last week thinking I'm stupid and pathetic and useless for no apparent reason. My psychiatrist thinks I did better on an SSRI, but the lack of libido was awful and not something I ever want to experience again.

Also, happy New Year to everyone in this sub and I hope you can have a better year compared to 2017. Stay safe, guys! You are all wonderful people :)",0,0
"So Tl:dr: used to cut, 2 years later, need to cut more than ever and can‚Äôt really properly focus on normal things. I used to cut pretty much every night but I managed to wean myself off of it, but all of a sudden I‚Äôm experiencing the worst need to cut I‚Äôve ever had, I don‚Äôt have anything to do it with and I‚Äôm doing my best not too, but it‚Äôs so hard and I‚Äôm scared of myself. I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to, so I felt I should post here. I hope you all have a better 2018 ahead, I wish you all the best",1,1
"Sometimes when I am overwhelmed with anxiety I go crazy. My mind cannot focus or complete any task and I act extremely irrationally. I crave to do something irrational, such as fuck an oxy addict, drink myself to oblivion or message my ex. I end up messaging people im close to, sharing too much information about myself and my mental state to them. wtf is this lmao",0,0
"Well its been 2 hours since the first humans on the planet began experiencing 2018. And yeah, life might be a meaningless and near endless well of suffering, but on the flip side the worse life is, the stronger we are for having gotten through it. Cheers to you all. Here's to another year of depression, and hopefully the last for many - that is, the last because happiness waits around the corner and if we keep fighting we'll get there soon. Cheers.",1,0
Nothing I do feels real. I feel like I've lost myself because I don't enjoy anything anymore. Everything I do just fills me the same feelings of saddens or anger I don't know what to do anymore. What can I do to turn the corner and get out of this state.,1,0
"Do you ever just stare up at the roof of your house/apartment and wish you lived in an old rustic cabin in the wood? Having the ability to stare up at the old logs and beams instead of the flat surfaces in modern ones. I do. I keep dreaming about my gradfathers cottage on the lake and I smile. Then I remember how my life really is and it all comes crashing down. Then I wish I was there for different reasons. I look up at my flat roof and wish it was beams, not for memories but so I can tie something up and go to sleep. I just want the pain to stop.",0,1
"People will treat you like shit regardless. You can give your best to people and they will still treat you how they want to. I am done trying to be good to people who aren‚Äôt good to me. The funny part is after it‚Äôs all said and done, you will still feel like the bad guy even though you weren‚Äôt in that situation. I just dont care enough to live in a world that doesn‚Äôt care about me.",1,1
"Over the past few years of depression, my bedroom has begun to look like an episode of the Hoarders TV show... Thankfully without the bugs. Most of the mess was me just not doing laundry. My cleanliness standards were such that I didn't do laundry more than once a month, but still refused to wear dirty socks and underwear. So, being the high functioning depressive that I am, I would frequently buy new socks and underwear as I ran out and febreez my jeans and shirts between washes. The underwear took care of itself as I also gained a shit ton of weight and threw stuff out as it no longer fits, but... This week I'm doing laundry. I'm trying to clean my room (ugh). I've done 5-6 loads and I'm still not done. I have so many socks I can fill an entire basket with *just* socks. Has anyone else found themselves in this situation? How do you cope? TL;DR: I kept buying socks while super depressed. Started doing laundry and now have a fuckton of them. Wat do.",0,0
"I feel as if people are ignoring me and what I say now. Some of my friends have become really popular and whenever I say hi or call their name they either look at me like they don't know me or just flat out disregard that I'm even talking to them. Barely a few friends have stuck with me at this point. My crush has seen me at my desk when I'm going through a rough time but she just ignores me. She has talked to me frequently but it just seems that she doesn't care. One of my friends who I thought was my friend leaked out that I'm autistic and have ADHD as well as I take medications for that every day. Now, whenever I walk around school people look at me and laugh while talking shit about me. Some have called me a freak and leave the school and go to a mental asylum. I've been called a mistake so many times. All this has been affecting me emotionally and physically. This has been making my depression worse and has increased my levels of anxiety. I've been having more anxiety attacks since this all started. Everything around me is starting to become meaningless to me. Nothing other than my mom, my dog, and my little brother give me a genuine source of happiness. The people at my school have made me feel even more worthless than I was before this. I want to feel accepted by someone other than my family. (I consider my friends family as well) People who don't talk shit about me or don't look at me strangely just disregard I'm there. Maybe their all right, maybe I really am just a mistake.",1,0
"I was doing better for a few weeks. Went on vacation for the holidays and it was supposed to be great. I never got that down time I so desperately needed. Now I go back to work tomorrow. I feel physical pain from the inside out. I want to scream and cry and tear my body apart. I hold my wife back. She makes more money , spends less, and is more adventurous. She would have moved to another state or country by now if not for me. All I do is waste money and time. I am bad at my job but we are short staffed so they won't fire me until things settle down. And I hate what I'm doing. But I got my masters and I have student loans to pay off. That is what is keeping me from commotion suicide. My wife would be stuck with the loan payments. But my God I want to die. Please kill me!!!",1,1
I stopped being able to watch movies months ago. Now I‚Äôm finding myself in conversations I and I have no idea what we‚Äôre talking about. I panic because I didn‚Äôt hear what they said even though I thought I was listening. I‚Äôm not even thinking of other things my brain just shuts them out. I‚Äôll take my dog out at 2.30pm and suddenly it‚Äôs 5.00pm. Where did the time go? Am I nuts or is this normal?,0,0
I just don‚Äôt have feelings of happiness or feel good anymore. Everyday just feels like a cloudy dream over and over again. I used to have such a zest for life and over the last 3-4 years it has completely disappeared. I cannot go on living and feeling like this on a daily basis.,0,1
I hate being around my family I get uneasy and start to get irritated. Both my dad and mom were alcoholics and physically and emotionally abusive in the past. Now I don‚Äôt even talk to them and when I do it‚Äôs in a robotic tone. I don‚Äôt hate my parents and I do sometimes feel bad for not being close to them but I can‚Äôt ignore how I feel. I don‚Äôt enjoy their company but I want the best for them. And before you judge me and call me a selfish son I wanna let you know that I‚Äôve been beat with wires and fist my feet hands and mouth were once taped while I was beat. The bias stopped when I started fighting back. They are also very controlling my mom is always on my back always hovering over me and I‚Äôm kinda annoyed by her she treats me like a little boy and like I can‚Äôt do nothing for myself. They limit me and I don‚Äôt wanna be around them.,0,0
