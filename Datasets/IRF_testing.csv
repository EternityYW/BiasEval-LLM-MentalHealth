"[I'm not seeking any medical advice, just want to know if anyone has had similar experiences] I've just started taking Lexapro for moderate depression and anxiety. For the first week I was prescribed 5mg, 10mg thereafter. It's been two days and I have this mild feeling like I'm on ecstasy/MDMA. My body feels light and I have this weird concentration of energy above my neck at the back of my head. Has anyone felt this/experienced this?",0,0
Im afraid. The suicide scale is true. Its gets progressively worse and you dont even realize it. I was at 1 contemplating death and that was it. Now as i live i keep moving farther into the scale. Not existing is all i long for. Its all i think about. Its all i desire. Ive written 2 goodbye notes. I constantly open up the lid of pills and acting as if ill swallow them. Yesterday and today i have been making nooses with a thin belt and putting it around my neck. I squeeze so hard to simulate what its like. When i do i can feel the pressure in the top sides of my head. I can feel the rush and fear. I stopped giving a shit about everything and my attention is mainly death. Someone please comfort me. I am afraid.,1,1
"I have found that one of the main issues keeping me from being productive and moving forward is my inability to believe in myself. That is, I‚Äôm too worried about what others perceive me to be, and never being able to relax and exist in the moment. I‚Äôve had therapy and medication for depression but none of it helps. If I can‚Äôt be better or get better, what‚Äôs the point? Why shouldn‚Äôt I just kill myself? I don‚Äôt want to keep trying. Life is boring. All my wildest dreams always lead to me ending up alone in some way or another. All so I can die without hurting anyone. I‚Äôve been going over the attempts at suicide I‚Äôve made in the past, and wonder if I just can‚Äôt follow through on anything. All the self harm and pushing people away are just half measures to the real solution. I‚Äôm lost and alone, 5 dollars to whoever wants a free pass to kill me.",1,1
":(( not sure wats wrong with me. i think i‚Äôve been feeling ok lately, content. now i‚Äôm having bad thoughts again. i‚Äôm overwhelmed. i feel so alone... no one actually gives a shit about how i feel. it won‚Äôt end :( i think i was meant to commit suicide. i feel stupid for trying to be positive. I got an actual 60% on this assignment at school and it fucked with me. i cried in the bathroom stall and cut myself up like the pathetic idiot i am. i‚Äôm so tired of myself.",1,1
"Help? I'm just feeling really shitty at how I seem to have spent the majority of my time recently lying around not doing anything, letting my room and shit get into a mess and just been consumed by negative thoughts. I'm also worse at a particular time of day. Like I've barely done anything productive this month and I hate myself for it, and I hate the fact I can't try hard enough/be bothered to help myself out of this. Some days are better than others, yes, but at the end of the day I just can't do it. I'm 17 and wasting my fucking life being lazy and doing nothing, the new year has made me realise. I want to make resolutions but I know I can't keep them so I'm not bothering. Any help/advice??",0,0
"There‚Äôs a bad situation in my group home that i‚Äôm unable to handle and they just say live with it and i can‚Äôt leave bc my parents are sick of me.

"Just like the title says, I have no good ways of doing the deed. Want to keep it non-gory for my kids sake. Consumed 90% of my waking days thinking about it. At my wits end with my wife even though we have a pretty decent relationship by most people's standards. Hell, we are the couple all our friends wish to be. Yet I have no desire to stay on this earth and continue to be unhappy with myself and my place, my purpose, and feelings of never being good enough for anyone or anything despite the constant praise and nut sucking of how smart I am and how much potential I have. Well if that was all true I'd never have been abused as a kid, treated like I have been as an adult, and maybe my life would be in a positive place. It's not so obviously all that other bullshit isn't true. Fuck it. I'm so done.",1,1

i hate how i isolate myself and then complain i hate myself since i know what i have to do but i cant choose it because i seem to love being sad / depressed i hate myself since i cant self harm like i desire i hate myself since i cant go back and change what has happened i hate myself since i put myself in these situations i hate myself since i just hate myself why cant i just die.. nobody would care if it happened this cruel world is sickening and i just wish i could put everyone that's made all of us suicidal on suicide watch. i hate the human race so much like i dont even know how i feel anymore all i know is sadness at the moment and pretending to be happy on the internet. like ive tried co2 poisoning for a short period of time with a towel covering my nose and mouth but i got scared and i didnt want anyone walking in on me attempting since i dont have my own room. i just wish i was able to do what many of you brave souls have realized on this reddit nobody understands at all and im just confused at the moment i dont even know why i wrote this but i hope you have a good new year. if you wasted your time reading this im sooo sorry please please pleaseee just try to get the time you spent on this back.,1,1

"It just blows my mind. Are there really people out there that wake up, don't continue to lay in bed, and just start doing things? I dunno how they do it. I don't get how someone could enjoy whatever their hobbies are, and enjoy them without ever stopping due to how pointless it is, or how pointless all of life is. I can't imagine what it's like to have a family that loves you, or to be an important person to anyone else. Some people can get so much out of life with minimal effort, and all I can really do is lay in bed and cry about how nothing makes me feel good, how I can't enjoy anything, and how incredibly lonely and alien I feel. Classic question: Why me?",1,0
I want the attention at least. Stabbing some human trash or just suicide by cop I think I should turn myself to the police. I'm going insane,1,0
"It sucks because a flaw about your personality can easily be fixed and I doubt it has a strong impact. Being reminded constantly of body flaws is the worse in my opinion because that can just ruin someone completely. It just hits you in the heart because that's what everyone views you as. What sucks even more is that, you can be confident in your own skin and as soon as someone points out a flaw, that thought stays with you forever and will never escape your mind. All these insecurities build up and it's just horrible.",0,0
"Welp, just got done with another batch of doctors visits and the results are in, I will be crippled for the rest of my life. But that's not what bothers me, I've had plenty of time to come to terms with my condition and the affect it will have on my quality of life and my life expectancy. What bothers me is the soul crushing loneliness, I havent had a girlfriend in years and I haven't been physically touched in what seems like forever. I spend all day in a shitty little side room by myself writing and hardly see hide nor hair of another person besides my dad most of the time. I'm pretty done with it all to be honest, I don't really see any reason to continue living like this.",1,1

She becomes sad for no reason, and I didn't know at first, for some reason I thought it was just normal (you know, uhh, girls) so I even felt annoyed (now I feel really bad and guilty though. No need to bash me, internet). But then it gets worse. She says feels like a ""piece of shit"". That she's worthless and stuff.

My faith is growing dimmer by the day because of asshats who ride in on a hypocritical high horse. My doc says with my depression, anxiety, and high blood pressure, I wont live to see 35. Most nights, virtually every night, I go to bed a bit more angry, a bit more suicidal, and hoping, praying to a god who couldn't give a rat's ass about me to either give me cancer or do not allow me to wake up. My only vent is either here, where we all fight enough of our own battles to not worry about anyone else's (I'm not blaming anyone) or smoking black and milds. That's my vent for the evening.",1,0

"(Venting, throwaway account for privacy.) My mind is blank. I cannot think. I don't want to eat. I don't want to try anymore. I've been trying for almost 30 years now. It hasn't gotten better like everyone said it would. It's just been a series of ups and downs, a rollercoaster that never seems to end. I fucking hate it. My partner's grad program fucked us over with direct deposit again, so now all our bills are gonna be overdue. Again. We barely have food in the house, and neither of us have had the mental energy lately to cook what we do have. I could pick up more shifts to work all weekend for pennies to try and slowly pay a tiny bit of everything off, but I won't be able to make enough to pay everything. I'll work myself to the brink of death again just to barely get by, smoke to get through the day, and drink to fall asleep at night. Or I could just end it all. My partner knows I'm mentally ill and tries their best. They go above and beyond any efforts I've ever seen, including my own parents. I don't want to leave them behind. I feel so guilty for feeling this way. But I just can't keep going like this. I want this to be over. And there's no end in sight. So I should just make my own exit.",0,0

"I was diagnosed with major depression Nov 2015, since then I have found out that I'm allergic to ssris and few other medications. I remember how I was long before I was officially diagnosed with depression and how I was when before I realized the depression symptoms set in before that summer and I honestly think that I will never be that person anymore. Due to some schedule mishaps, I missed taking my meds on a reg day basis and I felt the same off of them as I do on them. I'm back on them to therapeutic level and nothing. I get moments of excitement but they fade away into the background. I can't think of one thing that I'm happy about. The only really thing I care about is my job. That's it. I do it very well. I've been under the care of a psychiatrist for a year now and in therapy for 2 years. Just putting that out there.",0,0

My dad is living in the hospital. My mom had angina. My dad is a VERY COMPLICATED case. My mom's attitude is ""whatever"". And I have two older brothers, one who can't help through no fault of his own he has heart problems. The other can't be counted on, he flys out of province regularly. So often in fact that he doesn't even bother to let family know. I have the most amazing husband ever! He is simply the best thing that's ever happened to me. I have three of the world's most friendly cats. We live in a nice house, cheap rent for what we have. Awesome neighbors.and my favorite weather outside, sunny cold and crisp air with crunchy snow on the ground. But I can't kick this depression. I'm attempting medication finally. Because after two years I finally gave in and am trying them. So far I feel worse than usual. I don't know if I have anything left in me to keep trying. In the evening I feel better and try to fill my days as best I can Because commitment seems to be the only thing that gets me out of bed.",1,0
"Long story short: In december I talked to my mother about how I feel and that I currently don't get my shit together; Mainly work. She asked whether it's ok if my family would know (If they asked questions after christmas etc) and I told her it would be ok. First thing she did was going to my aunt and telling her and now my whole family knows and everyone is super protective and sending help, which is exactely what I don't need. When I critizied her, she started the whole ""everything I do is wrong""-bullshit and now even my father called me, who is currently in hospital because of his weak heart and told me I should start using my brain. While I'm writing this my mother sits crying in the kitchen after she told me that she can't deal with this whole current situation and that I ""don't live alone on this planet"". I do the fuck not know how to deal with this shit either. Getting drunk now. Thx for reading.",0,0

And then I realized everyone around me is fake. I envy those people who have friends who stick with them whatever happens. I wonder if I could still find real friends nowadays. Just one real friend would be nice. Just so I don't feel this way anymore. Some will say this too shall pass but it has been weeks and it ain't done yet.",1,0

I'm always set few clocks to have 100% chance of woke up. After 3 clocks I turn every single one off. I don't wanna get up. I wanna just lie in my bed for all day but after few minutes i get up. I feel extremely stressed and bad. I don't have any tests today and anything that could stress me so what the hell? Why am I feeling this way? When i'm in school nothing bad I think that would happen happened but I still feel bad. Even through ppl talk to me, nothing bad happen I feel worse and worse. Then I have suicide thoughts. Realy big. Actually I may do this, there are so big if they haven't ended after some time. They and bad mood ended when I have nice conversation with friend about makeing cover of Sepultura song. I suddenly stop feel bad and feel happy for few minutes. The thoughts ended but after I came back to my house, when I'm alone I feel bad again. What the hell is happening to me?

"Hello. I'm not depressed, but my friend is terribly blue. Their life is crumbling and I can't bear to see them like this. I care about them very much. I don't want to reveal much information and I hope you understand. To summarize for you all: * They were involved in some deep stuff. * Some time back, they got their house broken into and while fighting the intruder(s) off, they received an injury in their head. * The injury increased the mental illnesses they had, one of them being Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. &gt; And this resulted a rise on violent seizures, traumatizing flashbacks, haunting voices that returned to the time they were in that deep stuff, not to mention that they can barely get out of bed. * They tried contacting with their family and friends, they tried going to professionals for help for their bodily and mental dysfunctions, but to their dismay, they (the doctors) gave up in the last moment. * Their friends just turned their back on them and they treat them unpleasantly. I'm one of the few friends they have left and I'm distant from them in location and I don't think there's a chance I would be able to be with them. What can I do?",0,0
I'm using a new account because I can't remember my old password for my main account. But yeah I'm probably dead tonight. Im 20 and moved from the East coast to St Louis about 5 months ago ( it feels longer ). I got a good job delivering but quit it almost two weeks ago because I'm a bitch and was having an anxiety attack. I don't know what's wrong with me. A bit before quitting I went into the er because I was suicidal and spent 4 days trapped and with no actual help. I faked being better to get out. My only friends were at this job and they're mad at me ( understandably ). My old roommates are holding some of my stuff hostage until I pay them a certain amount of money. I've been couch surfing for the entire time up here. This was stupid. I hate myself. Sorry if it's not making too much sense I can't think straight right now. It doesn't matter either way.,0,1
"I'm new to reddit as of today. Recently, my depression has been super bad and I've been hoping for some other support besides the usual ""but your life seems to be going well"" and ""dont be to hard on yourself"" that I get from my parents. I dont really have anyone I feel I can connect to, so hopefully I can find someone here that is going through something similar. The few people ive talked to about it tell me that I have no reason to be sad because Im super high in my class rank, get high grades, got into a college with some big scholarships, and have been first chair hornist in my school band (or they say im just stressed out, which i am, but its just adding to my depression and making me feel even worse). Truth is, I have never really fit in or connected with anyone at school, leaving me with many shallow friendships and no one I feel I can trust. Work isnt any better either. Minimum wage for a shitty retail job and the only coworker who i got close to and who could understand me refuses to talk to me now for literally no reason given. Hell, im only 17 and I already feel stuck in an endless cycle of anger and disappointment that im going to be in stuck in for 2017 and the rest of my fucking life.

"My mother has been depressed most of her life from what I can tell. She and my father are separated. He's struggling with his own battle. I'm 24 in college and I live about an hour away. I come home nearly every holiday, because when I was living at home during community college she became very dependent on me(to do household chores, and support her emotionally). She's lost her white collar job about a year ago. She make some bad choices, transferred to a position that wasn't right for her, and got let go. Now she's working at a warehouse job that too physical for her(out of shape). I'm worried that her depression is getting worse and worse. I can't quit college to move back and take care of her. Nor, do I think that is the way to really help her. Every time I come home her house becomes dirtier and dirtier. She's missing bills, becoming more reclusive, and I'm worried she depleting her savings/retirement. She isn't taking care of herself and not really trying to fix any of this. She's becoming more disillusioned with her job search for another white collar job. She is going to therapy and taking medication, but I don't really see any improvement (actually the opposite). I don't know what to do. I really want to help her but I don't know how without enabling her dependence on me.",1,0

"I‚Äôm frustrated with my life. I have very few friends, and as a 20 year old college student about to turn 21 it‚Äôs driving me crazy to realize that I can‚Äôt celebrate it with anyone. My closest friends are all younger than me, and 2 of the closest are 16 (don‚Äôt worry, I met them through my job, I‚Äôm not a pedophile), so I feel pathetic for being unable to make friends my own age. It‚Äôs just plain creepy. Only thing that keeps people from calling me out is that I look only a year older than them. I‚Äôm gay, in a hyper conservative family, so I can‚Äôt please anyone in it. I live at home, so my life is restricted a lot (due to paying college expenses). My parents frequently remind me of my lack of friends and constantly question if I‚Äôm trying to sleep with every male I talk to, and particularly question my friendship with anyone younger than me. They think that because I‚Äôm gay, I‚Äôm a pedophile. The few friends I had my own age ditched me because they think me being gay is disgusting.

"Three years ago my dad died, it hardly feels like three weeks. It's like everything else in my life is so insignificant in comparison, it's like a black hole that distorts my perception of time. It's as if time passes 100x faster since it and everything before it is so long ago. People say that after a major event in their life everything feels categorised into before and after it but to me it feels like things that are it and not, but most of them are. People have been telling me since then that I probably have depression and should maybe get help but that's mostly just from seeing me because I don't open up. I feel like I've just always been a little gloomy and don't feel very different now compared to before other than the whole bending of time thing.

"Hi, do any of you have practical advice and methods on how to overcome fear? There are some things I have to do which, when I try to start them, cause me to have this intense freezing fear. In my case it can be opening various mail or even starting to read some book. It could even be when I decide to rent a movie. I know I shouldn‚Äôt be afraid and I do not see rational reasons for it, but I get waves of fear that feel like there is a predator that is going to attack. I feel it and I am gripped with stillness and fear as if I am hiding and can‚Äôt move or breathe heavily because it could reveal my position. Because of this I end up not doing things I have to do, missing some deadlines, not going to the dentist. Well the dentist is understandable since no one wants to go to them. In my case it is mundane things. This is probably a symptom of PTSD I am diagnosed with, but I still need to find ways to overcome these irrational fears.",0,0

One text from a girl destroyed ever bit of progress I've made to better myself since November. I've been feeling good, maybe happy since then. I've been doing good, been free of self harm. Until today. The only thing that could get my mind of her was pain. I have to hang out with her and my friends tomorrow. They are probably going to see my fresh cuts.

The problem is that my mom and I are both powerless because my dad has us under his money.

My mother has been through 2 cancers and survived, had just retired form her stressful office space and now she's being treated like this by some shithead of a father?!

"PSA: when someone takes their life, the wrong thing to do is reach out to their closest friends asking for explanations surrounding their depression and general mental state. You certainly DO NOT state that you wish the deceased had reached out to their friends. NEWSFLASH: THEY WISH THAT TOO! This is not a time to point fingers, dig for answers, or to share just how much this has hurt you (I'm talking to you -- the people who have met my friend once or twice) -- especially over social media. Depression isn't simple. It is not brought on by having a few bad days at work. It is not remedied by a change of scenery, a phone call, or a quick trip to the doctors. The people who were closest to the deceased are not here to console you. Life is not about you. It is about the people who surround you. It is a time to celebrate the persons life who has passed, reflect inward, and reach out to those who are in your life and ask for what they might need.",0,0

During the beginning of my teenage years, (13) I didn‚Äôt care about anything, how i looked, or anything of that sort. Looking in mirrors was fine, and life was good. When i hit 14 i sent a really horrible selfie of myself to a group of online friends, was bullied really bad for it, and so on. From then on i‚Äôve been incredibly alert of myself, if you know what i mean. I stayed with this friend group because they were the only people i knew and could talk to, my parents hated me for being gay, and my brothers only took in their footsteps. After this, i just completely broke down, got so insecure that i wore a jacket for a year because i was so scared of anyone seeing me. That ended when i was 14. I stopped because i just decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and that i was the only problem in that situation. Since then, it‚Äôs only gotten worse.

However, as I entered my mid-20s and entered a serious relationship, I felt competing priorities and wanted to potentially pursue career paths that had more stability and less time away for things like touring. Since then, I've been locked in paralysis for over a year about I should be doing with my life. I feel a lot of regret about leaving the music path, yet don't feel confident enough to rejoin it either. Similarly, I feel hopeless attempting to commit myself to another path that will make me fulfilled.

"Ive been on Viibryd for about a year give or take. The first few months I gained about 20lbs and all together ive gained 25lbs( last I knew.) I stopped weighing myself about 2 months ago because it was getting even more depressing. I've read a few forums and have noticed that most people have experienced rapid weight gain with this medication, and no matter how hard they've worked- the weight wont budge. same issue here. I'm ready to ditch this medication because 1. I'm sick of dealing with the weight gain, going to the gym 3-6 times a week has done nothing. 2. it seems to increase my anxiety at times. 3.Its expensive(even with a coupon code and insurance.) The thing is- I'm VERY scared as I know that depression can become harder to treat over time. I tried probably about 8 medications before I found this one- I really thought there was no hope beforehand. I've stuck it out because obviously mental health is more important that weight gain, but the weight gain is causing me to obsess over what I eat/how often I workout. Does anyone currently take viibryd? Have you even come off of it, what was it like? I heard the withdrawals are horrible.",0,0

This can last for anytime between 2-3 hours to a whole day.

"I'm an 18 male and I'm very confused about life as a whole... I know school is important but I'm disencouraged to pursue it. I can't seem to do anything normal teens do like going out, clubbing or partying or even casual picnics. For as long as I have lived I've never really done something with friends.. At first, it was because of family problems I ended up hating wanting money or needing it so I created a lifestyle for myself in which I don't use money or ask my parents for it. My life has always been sitting behind a screen watching people enjoy life and thinking to myself that once I get a bit older the family problems would be gone and the coast would be clear but I was dead wrong. Now I'm 18, a loser no lifer, worthless, socially unwanted and ugly and the reason I say ugly is because I truely consider myself ugly.. I reckon the last time I actually bought new clothes was in the summer like january 2016.. I have been thinking a lot and maybe this is my life and I should accept that.. I can't really see a way out of the situation I'm in because weither its now or in the future, I will have to be in situations where the same family problems still present themselves..

"Hey everyone. First time poster. I've had depression for about 11 years now. I wanted to know if any of you with chronic depression have also experienced this... Now that I am a bit older and have had the illness for so long, I'm kinda more just okay with it?

I'm graduating high school a semester early with a fairly low GPA (2.7 weighted) despite my myriad veritable academic interests because I have this overwhelming boredom and this feeling that nothing is happening when I'm there. This nothingness has grown increasingly pervasive in my life. I want to go to college but feel it is not in my best interest at the moment. I want to take a year off and work but am worried a year might turn into a lifetime of dead-end jobs and complacency. I want sometimes to pass my house in my Jeep and keep driving. But what would that solve? I guess what I'm getting at is that I have no direction at the moment and nothing is calling me particularly loudly. I don't know where to go or what to do. I often find my eyes welling up and my fingers tapping my quivering leg with a sense of urgency, but alas I am still sitting.

I got rejected by someone I really cared about, and it didn't go well. After farther reflection, I haven't made progress on any of the goals I set to fix myself, even though I put in all my effort. My little confidence I gained is shattered. For the last few days, I have though about sueicde a lot, to the point where I don't go into work anymore because there is no point. That friend I had has moved up in life, to the point where I feel if I reach out to him I will just be a burden anyways. I am not close to my family at all, and if they knew I was depressed they would tell me to suck it up. I don't believe in religion, it's likely we live in a computer simulation so nothing will matter if I go. I am going to die alone, so why wait for it to happen naturally?",1,1

"I've never talked about this with anyone, but I really don't want to live anymore. Because what is the point? Why am I here? I can't do anything useful in my life until I become an adult, I ruin almost everything, I cut a lot and am always worried someone will see the scars. I get confused when I see people genuinely enjoying themselves and having fun. It blows my mind. How are they so happy? How can anyone love themselves? I don't love myself. I'm fact I hate myself. Because I deserve it. What use am I to anyone? The answer is none. I'm not of any use. And you know why? It's because whenever I've tried to be useful I mess it up. So, what's the point? What the point of enduring an existence that I can't seem to enjoy? I haven't been diagnosed with depression, so I'm not going to claim that I have it. But, what other explanation is there? And even if that is the explanation, does it even matter? Does anything really matter? To whoever read this all the way through, (I know this sounds cliche) thank you for reading my scattered thoughts and emotions. I hope you have a good day tomorrow. Update: I haven't been able to talk to my mom as she's kind of having a 'quiet time' day and I don't want to bother her. I also have a question. Would it be unhealthy for her if I talk to her?

"So, in the past year i've had 3 jobs. In the beginning of 2016, i worked 2 jobs and ended up just not showing up at both due to some personal reasons with my ex around May/June. I didn't get another job until September. So here i am, only working there a few months, and this is the second time i've done a no call no show within 3 weeks. I can't get myself to get out of bed. I just turned 19. I had to have my mom call off for me the other day because i was having a mental breakdown. The jobs i have are not even stressful, but i'm so terrified to actually CALL and talk to a manager and tell them i can't come in, and it's not like being depressed is a work excuse. I go to school full time as well. I technically don't HAVE to work, but i feel useless if i don't. I guess the point of this post is, does anyone have any advice on how to keep a job with depression? Or have any recommendations on jobs? I take medication, so there's nothing else to really help. I'm actually a really hard worker when i don't hit my lows, which is like every few weeks..",0,0

"Kinda lengthy post, but I'm just really lost right now so my apologies in advance... So today, my best and only friend, he finally gave up on me. I've tried my very best to hide my depression from him, even going as far as constantly putting a mask on and suppressing my true emotions in an attempt to appease him and not become burdensome. But as many of you well know, that tends to become rather exhausting real quick... and sometimes our depressive nature shows. And today mine showed. He wanted to hangout and watch something, and I wasn't feeling up to it at all, so I politely let him know. He then went on to say in response ""You're always in such a gloomy mood... stop trying to make people feel bad for you cause it's not gonna happen."" He then told me that I need to grow up and that he doesn't want to talk to me for a while until I grow up... I'm not sure what to do now, like how I should go about this.

"I've been doing the only thing I'm capable of to hold myself in place at this point, which is doing everything I can to ignore it all.

I've been spending days and more days barely taking care of myself, and just existing in my home, from which I barely leave for days on end. I've been avoiding this conclusion forever, mostly because I'm so scared of it. I don't think I want to exist. Every single night I try really hard to dream and fantasize about my deepest desires, in a desperate attempt to find a reason to pull myself up and keep going, but lately, I've been giving up so easily. I feel like nothing's is really worth it, and that includes myself. The thought of just ending it keeps coming over and over again, and it's getting harder and harder to fight back. I'm scared. I feel cold and worthless. But what's worse is that I know tomorrow will be exactly the same. I know there are people who love me and do so much for me, and I appreciate every single second they invest on me... But I've been really afraid of the idea that, even tho they try to, they can't really change things or help me in the ways that really matter in the end, like my mental condition, my traumas and the inescapable barrier that is my social class.

"So I went to therapy twice last week with my first therapist. I was upfront with her that I wanted therapy in addition to possible medication (my anxiety is unbearable at times and my depression has gotten a lot worse lately). She said she doesn't believe in meds and won't refer me to a psychiatrist, but I can't self refer to any psychiatrists because the wait times in my area are so extreme that they only accept referrals for adult patients. I feel really comfy with her as a person and we've started to build a good rapport, but I've been struggling with intense anxiety since I was a child and depression for over a decade. I'm not formally diagnosed but I work in mental health care and I know what anxiety and depression disorders look like. I want therapy and I want to be psychiatrically evaluated and supported too. So should I try to switch therapists to someone who has a more similar medical philosophy to my own or stick it out with this one that I like so far (besides her refusal to help me get in meds)? I don't have a lot of people I can get support from for a decision like this so i appreciate any help or advice you guys have.",1,0
Everyday I could be fine but eventually the thought of my death creeps in to my thought and it makes me sad. I have been questioning what is on the other side all my life and sometimes I just think I should kill myself to get it over with.

"Hi. I have had a bit of a rough day and honestly it feels like my thoughts are actually killing me. So I really feel like I need to express my feelings right now. So my thoughts are just gonna be thrown out there so without further ado.... I think I suck. At everything...my job, having friends, just...everything really. It honestly feels like I cannot just work like a human being. Now don't get me wrong, i don't hate life. I have things I rather love about life such as my family and my job including the people I work with. And everyone keeps telling me how ""nice"" and ""good"" I am at my job such as winning a rather ""employee of the month"" sorta thing but as strange as this seems.... I struggle to believe them. Now of course I'm not calling them liars I just find it to hard to believe. I know that sounds rather stupid but I honestly just can't help feel this way. As I said I truly love my job and everyone there but that is honestly where most of my self esteem comes from so constantly thinking I'm horrible at it is obviously not a good cycle. Now as for everything else apart from my job, well I will just break it down like this: I'm at overweight, ugly, shy, embarssing and awkward guy that honestly anyone could cringe at talking to. And of course I'm trying to overcome some of these things like the overweight part but...I'm honestly losing hope at this point and it's giving thoughts of doing something silly to my self.

"Hi, As the title suggests, where to go or how to help yourself where my options are severely limited? My GP can only organise pills for me. I have no way of acquiring a therapist. I have been severely depressed for past couple of weeks and mildly since about November. I don't have a trusted parent, sibling or a friend that I could open up to. I tried a while ago but I ask to support me in functioning day to day, pushing me to work and they just tell me they're sorry or they wish they could help.

My boyfriend just says he doesn't know how to help me and has phases of randomly complimenting me or texting me to tell me he loves me for two days straight then he forgets all about it. I'm sure he tries his best but I just wish I had more support and he says ""he can't help me anymore than he does"" everytime. I feel so trapped. I always have to pretend I'm fine. I always cover up with humor. It seems like I'm insincere or dramatic when I finally snap and just say I'm a mess. I can't afford a therapist. My university counselling office won't help me.

"I've had a rough two weeks and can't study for shit right now. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone and thoughts of suicide are having a hayday. Any belief I used to have in myself being other than a failure has crashed to pieces for the millionth time... But I still have to sit up and shut up, and not show a thing. My grandparents - ALL of them - are still sick and have been so for several weeks, my grandma had even been rushed to ER but at least she's in recovery now. My family - Mom, Dad and little sister - have had no choice but to rush between them with the little time off work they've had. Except that I'm studying so my family insisted I won't take days off. My family is busy all week trying to keep the situation under control, and I can't help them. On the other hand I also can't study because I'm so depressed my brain won't work, or rather it works overtime on focusing on how I feel and not on studying. So not only am I a worthless sack of shit on my own, I'm also letting down my family and can't do anything about my depression since they are already so burdened.",1,1

"Hey, I created an account because I honestly dont know what I am doing anymore on here. Last year was the worst of my life. My long time GF (4 years) and I broke up. She lives in a different state so I flew there to speak to her and atleast end it on good terms. The day after I started a new job. It started well with my manager happy but the next week I had another manager who joined (the person who hired me was sacked). Towards the end of the first month, I ended up having surgery on my back. This is where the issues started, The surgery and the breakup really affected me physically and mentally and I kept making errors which were easily avoidable. Eventually it got too much for them and they released me. It took me 3 years to find the job in my field which I graduated in and i honestly thought it was what I was looking for. Unfortunately, I got left with no job and now no partner. I have a job now - in my field but not exactly the same (if that makes sense) but it is really going nowhere. My manager is good and is happy with my performance but the organisation does not allow for any growth. The person who I replaced is younger than me and is already far ahead in their career than I will. To top it all off, I live in a small town and it will be hard to hide the termination. I honestly dont know what is the point anymore. No matter what I do, it feels it is never enough and I am not going anywhere",1,0

It takes an incredible amount of mental willpower to get myself out of bed in the morning and feed myself.

His article Anatomy of Melancholy (http://andrewsolomon.com/articles/anatomy-of-melancholy/) he wrote in 1999 for The New Yorker in which he talks about his own personal battles with depression have made him a huge advocate for depression and is very informative.

"I have never been diagnosed with depression or even talked to a professional about it being a possibility. But I used to think about it a lot. Especially during the last several years of my previous relationship. I felt like the worst human being because my SO was actually a wonderful person, but I couldn't bring myself to feel happy. Instead, I felt trapped. I often thought I would eventually have to consider suicide if I wanted to get out of it, but I didn't need to worry because I wasn't at that stage yet. I just cried a lot. I also grew to find self harm theraputic, but knew I wouldn't do anything 'too far'. When I did end that relationship, I did an emotional 180, which let me justify and blame all those feelings on the relationship. And up until now I believed that. I have been in my current relationship for a little less than a year and I am just starting to feel myself sink. But this time it has nothing to do with my SO. In fact, I'm terrified because I'm so invested in them and I don't want them to see me this way. I'm scared of losing them because all I can do is sit around and be a pathetic mop of a person.

I was supposed to print out a syllabus but I didn't do that and I think I need to get a textbook for the class but I haven't checked and haven't done anything to get ready for this class. I don't know what the point of this post is. Edit: Also I just realized I signed up for the wrong class. What the fuck is wrong with me",0,0

"I tell myself this every year. But I am fed up with living every day. I don't want to get out of bed, I just want to die. I hate my home I hate my family and I hate my life. I have tried to kill myself ever since I was 5, I was not meant to be in this world. I am very sick as well, and hate being sick. I had a fun New Years up until I got home. It's 3:02 and I'm disappointed with myself again. I've been to therapy and a psychiatrist but nothing works. I have a job already but I lack the skills to talk to others, I try and have improved a lot but other times I always feel like they're talking bad about me. I work hard but I never think it's hard enough. I think I'll have to get three jobs soon due to starting college and I honestly don't want to be 30 or 40 still having to pay student loans. I think I am going to kill myself this year. I made a post on here similar to this but ended up not doing it because I couldn't leave my friend alone. But now we barley talk.",0,1
"It's like this: when I can't leave my bed, when I'm crying all the time, when I'm constantly late to work, when I haven't showered in weeks, I can tell myself: these are very clear, objective signs of depression. No wonder you're struggling with everything. Be kind to yourself. When I'm able to hold a steady job without screwing up, when I can keep in touch with family pretty consistently, when I can clean my apartment: it makes all the things I still struggle with seem to be due to personal failings rather than disorder. So I hate myself. I can't focus enough to watch a movie or read a book? Well, you can be on the internet for hours, so you're not trying hard enough to focus. I've completely ghosted most of my friends? Well, you can still contact your family and two of your friends, so you're not really socially anxious; you're just an asshole. I'm slow to speak and struggle to find words? Your brain is working better than when you were REALLY depressed, so you're a boring person with nothing interesting to say. By the way, you're a lot dumber now because the real depressive episodes ruined a bunch of brain matter. I feel ""meh"" and numb all the time? You're not trying hard enough to experience new things. You get up to go to work; you should be able to easily get up and take a walk when you have the day off. I don't know where I'm going with this.",1,0

I want to have a terminal disease. I want to reach out for a cop's gun. I fantasize about all the ways to die. But I just can't do it myself.

But anyway...I fell back asleep and woke up again half an hour ago about 11:30am and I had all these weird dreams where I had to sleep in my father's car while he was gone somewhere, another one where I was at my friends place depressed and no one noticed, one where I was drinking the same vodka that jacksepticeye was drinking on a YouTube video (wtf), one where I was running away from crumbling buildings and a few where I'd wake up in the dreams and still wouldn't be actually awake.

"They're basically all friendly towards me until I talk about my feelings and depression and then they're like ""Oh you're depressed? Bye"" it's not even that people just don't want to deal with me, whether its my close friends that I used to open up too. (Found out quickly that they weren't close to me at all because they all left me) The worst part is is that when girls talk about their depression or their anxiety people are like ""Awww do you want someone to talk to, are you okay?"" But when guys talk about feelings our depression I just can't because I know all they would do is just pay no attention. It's so dumb. Am I the only one that thinks like this?

"My truck metaphor of the things that run me over all ay once everyday. It's a long story I could probably write a book... i might write a book... lol I used to struggle HEAVILY with severe anxiety and my parents would belittle it until I was having anxiety attacks and even then they said that therapists were for crazy people (my parents are very traditional and care about what others could say about you). My boyfriend was always there for me even though, at the time, my anxiety wad mainly caused by him (emotionally). He understood and was the only one who could calm me down. Post emotional shit I was also very depressed because I was disappointed in the person I became. Because morally I'm very black and white and I let my boyfriend fall in my Gray space. And that was new because I've never loved someone like I love him. He is the light of my life and existence no matter how much shit we have been through in the last 3.5y. Yoga and meditation and send awareness got me though that, mostly.

First time on antidepressants but I've been on them for 4 months now. I like the meds I'm on now and if I have an issue then I'll make an appointment with my psychiatrist is what I thought.

I was already hangry, had made myself some chicken in the oven, but set the heat too low, so it came out frozen. I was fumed and was ready to cry because I was so hungry and just really wanted some ramen. And, because all we've been doing this weekend is going to parties, we didn't have food at home. My mom was really annoyed that I was sulking and she asked me why I was feeling the way I was feeling. I just told her that I felt I was a 5 year old that wasn't getting their favourite food for dinner and that I'll be fine after I finish being sad. And then she said ""well maybe if you stopped sulking so much you wouldn't have depression."" after that I told her to fuck off and that what she said was an insensitive thing to say to anyone who was depressed and that she was lucky I'm not suicidal.

I've slipped into a bout of depression. Ive also come to the conclusion that the xmas/new year period sucks. Ive had a number of job changes and have moved between cities this year. Also had a gf but i dumped her after i caught her being intimate with someone else. I moved back home when i found out my mum has cancer. I got another job which i find stressful. I dont get paid a lot but i do my best. Leading up to xmas i was doing 60-70 hour weeks and fell sick due to burnout. Xmas sucked. I was bed ridden the whole day. I went back to work for a couple of days after xmas with a rotten attitude. I felt undervalued and no longer motivated. And i felt so shit at my job and made some bad mistakes. I do my best to help my mum. Out of the blue one day my mum tells me that she is no longer proud of me. This hurt. My best friend recently moved to the other side of the world. I noticed recently that struggle to make friends and really dont want another gf. To compensate for this i became a workoholic.

At least during those times, I wasn't depressed (somehow). I know what I need to do. I need to find a therapist who understands what I'm going through. I must have been chipping away at a mental wall I built up or something all this time because it finally came crashing down after a series of thoughts and I NEED to tell someone about it.

"Been with my boyfriend for a year now, and after getting out of an abusive relationship with my ex of 4 years. A lot happened to me, and I'm still trying to cope. Since then, I've been switching medications, weaning off, increasing, etc. My moods are all over the place, and recently I've been crying over everything. My boyfriend thinks I'm overreacting and I should move on from the sexual and emotional abuse I experienced for years. He has never understood what it's like to battle depression, and I can't find a way to show him it's more than being ""sad"" over ""stupid"" things that happened in the past. Recently, I've been diagnosed with tuberculosis, had to quit my job due to hostile work conditions, can't go back to the medical field now because of the TB, out of money and relying on my parents, I have no friends, can't make friends because everyone around here is an asshole, struggling with weight problems for the first time in my life, still trying to wrap my head around the fact I was raped, and a lot of other issues that just keep piling up. I don't know what to do. He doesn't take me seriously, which leads to arguments, which then leads to me crying, and he can't deal with crying. He says I cry too much, I need to stop letting everything bother me. Duh, I'm trying? I just want to feel like someone is there for me. I feel so alone and he's right here next to me.",1,0

I would like to hear those with severe depression talk about whether they feel they have the ability to consent and make decisions on sensitive matters during severe depressive episodes. It feels like society tells everyone that it is their fault if they make a bad decision, that they are responsible for their choices, and most dont understand mental illness properly and to me its not that black and white. I want to know whether you think you truly have the capacity to be at fault for a decision youve made if it is something you would not have done outside an acute depressive episode. Four abilities are usually assessed with decision making when I was looking around. The only studies I found were for research purposes (which saddens me, but thats a whole other topic). The four abilities: Understanding Appreciating Reasoning Ability to express a choice Now I cant say I know the exact ways to interpet these 4 things right now without further research but, do you feel you possess these abilities during a severe depressive episode? Do you possess some and not others? Does it vary? My answer would be during a severe depressive episode, I do not possess any of these reliably at every moment.

"I wanted to die starting in Jan 2018, but things have only gotten worse.

You have your back, and that‚Äôs what matters at the end of the day. Keeping this in mind, Take care of yourself and be proactive towards seeking friendships and human connections whenever possible. We humans are social creatures, so having this emotional connection can literally save you. It saved me, at least.

First of all, I hated both schools generally. I had always wanted to go off to college but couldn't afford it.

Now it's two years later, I have nothing but general courses, I thought I'd try computer science and hated it...So I'm back where I started.

"Just to give some background, I've felt pretty depressed for most of my adult/adolescent life (I'm 21 now) but have never felt able to talk to anyone about it (not even family or close friends). I have days where I'm in a slightly more positive mood, but generally I just feel pretty apathetic about everything, lethargic and extremely self-critical to the point where it stops me doing things. I don't really have physical symptoms but being this low obviously causes me to neglect my health quite a bit. My environment and lifestyle certainly have an impact; I recently moved in with my aunt who has very little understanding of depression (and just emotions generally), and I'm living in a place where I don't really know anyone. Anyway I took an NHS depression self-assessment recently and the results suggested that I should go and see my GP. However, I'm seriously doubting whether to do it, I feel like I'd just be a waste of their time. Besides I know that there's a chance that they might suggest taking anti-depressants, and I'm a little reluctant about that given everything that I've heard and read about them and their side effects. Sorry for the long post, guess I just needed to vent, but any advice would be really appreciated.",1,0

I hate that I have had to choose my wife over the family I grew up with, but I‚Äôd make that choice a million times over, no regrets. My mother has been nothing but cruel and evil.

For example, I assume that I'm going to suck at a job and never get promoted, so I don't try hard because I view the effort as futile. The prediction therefore fulfills itself. I recommend this powerful, encouraging book, it's available in B&amp;N for about $12.00. It's the foundation of all modern Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that modern psychologists use.

"I **need** this year to be better. I'm nearing the end of my third year of college. The new semester is approaching quickly, and I desperately need a good one in order to save me from failing. I failed two courses last semester. I was miserably depressed the whole time and it showed on my GPA. That was my free pass; I can't afford to fail any more. If I do, I won't graduate on time. If I don't graduate on time, I don't graduate at all because they'll cut $8000 of financial aid and I can't magically come up with that money myself. But this year doesn't have to be like that.

For context purposes, I'm an accountant and have been one for almost a decade now. I was the kid who studied his butt off in school with the expectation that would pay off in the form of a good job, success etc. I was also one of those people that thought he was better than others, where deep down I wasn't. Really, everybody is special and unique in their own ways. Anyways, what I'm getting at is I feel I've put a lot of bad energy out there and it's all culminating into one big disaster over the past few months. That disaster being the realization that the skills that I say I have on paper I don't actually have in real life (somehow miraculously I got by the past 10 years) and now I don't know what to do.

Recently made a post about how I was going to stop self harming it's now 12:45 no one has wished me a happy new year not my parents or the freinds I believed cared about me. This has just showed me that no one truly cares and I'm about ready to give up I have spent the last year when I was at my worst making sure that I made the people I work with happy and when I needed help the most I have been forgotten by everyone I have never been so upset and let down I no longer care about faking a smile fuck everything,1,0
"I‚Äôm just laying in bed with tears rolling down after waking up from a long nap. My thoughts are scattered so bear with me. I feel pressure in my chest. I have work deadlines and shit I should have done over the holidays. It was an easy work day though since I left early to get a tooth fixed that I‚Äôve neglected for more than a decade. I didn‚Äôt see the point in getting it fixed though - my dentist made me. It‚Äôs a waste of time and effort on me. I went home after and had a 4 hr nap ... and woke up disoriented in the dark before it hit me that I‚Äôm still alive in this life I hate. I always find myself in this place thinking and fantasizing about the end, no matter how my day went. My day could have been amazing and I still ending up thinking about the best way to die. I have help- I have a family, a wonderful psychiatrist, a good job. I had a lot of love to give but in the end I just don‚Äôt want to live. No matter how much people try to convince me, I just don‚Äôt think I was made for living. I‚Äôve tried, I‚Äôve really tried. I exercise and run, I socialize, I work, I spend time with my family. But all I want to do is waste away. I wish I could give my body away to someone who would appreciate it more. I‚Äôm not going to end it though because I am not brave enough, so I just fantasize while laying in bed doing nothing productive at all.",0,1

"Depression functions in a way where our percieved ""rock bottom"" always happened somewhere in the past month. The truth is, depression gets worse overtime. That rock bottom that people claim to hit is just an illusion. You are depressed for ten months, feel like you are over it for one month, then sink. You keep sinking farther down into the earth until you reach fucking hell. You keep getting lonelier until you start getting confused whether you're saying stuff in your head or out loud. You grow to be more disgusted by yourself. Your ugly face, your ugly mind, all your fucking failures, and your stupid fucking ego. You feel more and more guilty, regretting every fucking desicion that you make that makes you the stupid failure that you are. You start to cry so much that you can't cry anymore.

But I realised that it's important for our mental well-being to do some form of activity. So I decided to join a bellydance class - a hobby that will keep me fit but also be enjoyable, since I loved dancing when I was child. I think we should all try to find a hobby to distract ourselves from our low moods and if we get really good at it, who knows, maybe we could enter competitions or make money from doing it on the side.

He had a meaningful job where he met my mom, who left the company a few weeks after starting dating him. At some point he was ""promoted"" but not really, and left the job shortly after. Long story short: he popped from job to job until 45 yo, and have been unemployed since. My mom works and earn enough money to feed us (although some months this becomes an issue), but her job takes her away from the family for like 2 weeks straight sometimes, which obviously she hates. At 55, and unemployed for 10 years, my dad feels depressed and guilty for not being able to give my family a better life.

What's worse, it marks another year during which I was totally miserable. Every New Year's Eve, I am made to reflect that I felt just as bad over the last year as I did the year before, often worse. I don't feel any better about anything in my life after a whole year having passed. Every year I tell myself that I am trying harder than I ever have to be better, and that there is some prospect that in the next year there will be something in my life that makes it worth living, that takes a little bit of the pain away.

Forgive me if I sound extremely stupid but I've finally convinced myself after years of ignoring my depression to go see a doctor. I'm confused as to how the process works if a person does get prescribed medication. I know there are tons of different kinds of medication so how does the doctor know which one to prescribe? Do you have a say in which antidepressants you're leaning towards?

He died in April and I've been functioning but I feel fucking terrible most days. I wake up feeling so shitty, like complete despair. I feel like this planet and most of the people on it suck to be frank. I never had a clear cut direction or passions to follow so I find myself thinking about my purpose a lot. I do wish I could end my life some days but I know I never will. I go to therapy. I have tried some medications but honestly I haven't found anything that works. I don't enjoy anything really so I don't have hobbies. I do have a fiance. He is a saint. He's my only real support. He's been getting me through. I just need to know of anyone who has been this bad and came back. What meds have worked for you, what have you done to get yourself out of this?

I find myself staring at things and thinking about nothing, whereas my mind used to spend a lot of time thinking about everything. Does anyone else feel like this? Sometimes, like now, I realize it's happening and it makes me feel worse to know it's happening but sometimes it really doesn't even bother me because sometimes feeling nothing can be better than feeling anything, ya know?

I been thinking about religion. Like if you believe their is a God. Well he or she since God created man and women. Well God is the only super hero. I started to believe in a God since DINOSAURS. Even I try to pray to a God to take me back to 1994. Even my life is going no where. I have a mental illness called schizophrenia where the brain cognitive is dysfunctional. Hallucinations and hearing voices that arent their. Which makes me think solipsism. But hell im no God when I believe a God. Since I didnt create clouds trees or even DINOSAURS. I admit mental illness has no path of success. Even I want to give up to pray for a new one cause im getting old. If I could live forever I would cause dying isnt going to get better.

"Like I often think that depression isn't a disability and I'm always in amazement when I am actually aloud to take time off of work from it.

"A month ago I was feeling suicidal. During that period I had a conversation with my son's 16 year old cousin from his mom's side of the family. During our conversation he mentioned to me how much he cares and looks up to me and how I was the only adult he could talk to about girls, his problems, and guitars (shit all teenage boys like to talk about). After our conversation I started thinking about what he said and about all the people in my life that care/depend on me (my son, parents, friends, etc.). And for some reason it seemed like more of a reason to kill myself. I found comfort in knowing that if I killed myself I would be missed. I knew they would be sad for awhile but eventually they would move on and think about all the good times we had.

"Hi all, A friend of mine has gone down a depression spiral over the past year and 1/2. She has seen psychologists and psychiatrists and the only thing they seem to help with is medication. She has refused to take the medication properly. She started but stopped after feeling terrible. She will make plans and then cancel them because of her panic attacks. They happen daily at specific times, she has one at 7am daily. They will also occur intermittently throughout the day and which point she will be unable to do anything but runaway and be alone, presumably. She cannot work, remember things consistently, or think. She has attempted to jump out of a moving vehicle. Friends and family have all come to her aid but she essentially refuses any kind of answer because they do not solve her issues. I'm not sure there is a correct answer. The biggest source of sadness for her is her age, coupled with where she is in life. She has spent the past 4 years in a masters program for biology that most likely will not amount to a job. She feels as if she wasted her time and will have nothing to show for it. I have suggested changing fields but she doesn't have the financial resources to do so comfortably. She is also engaged and doesnt not feel comfortable relying on her fiance for money. She doesn't make a lot of money, so paying for therapy isn't an option, really. I'm just a friend, but I feel helpless that I cannot help her. She has attempted to hurt herself, so I want to do whatever I can or at least be helpful in some way. Any suggestions would be helpful.",0,1

"I know that a lot of people say that they lost their younger years to anxiety and depression. There is no doubt that I've definitely lost a lot of years to those same things, but I feel like a large portion of my life has been wasted in school. Of course there is a lot of useful things schools teaches that can be applied in every day life, but school has become the worst part of my day, which is especially troubling since it takes up such a large part of it. And after school, I'm just so drained and it makes me so sad to be alive. You'll probably have it in most school systems regardless of country, but American school are just such a shitty environment for people who have mental issues. How am I even supposed to properly deal with these issues when I'm constantly bombarded with all this schoolwork? How am I supposed to experience life and enjoy it when I'm trapped in an environment that worsens my mental health and anxiety? It's my last year of high school, but I still can't help but feel like I would be happier having dropped out. Realistically, the long term would look worse, but school environments are so toxic a lot of the time. The pressure to conform is just so strong and I don't know how other people feel, but it almost makes me hate being different, it makes me want to be ""normal"" I'm just venting a little.

It's been this way for years. **Backstory** Severely abused as kid. Then when i got out, I would over react to situations like a psycho. Extreme over the top protective responses to minor things. I never hurt anyone, hit anyone, but was a hot emotional mess with how i handled things. Learned to manage that with years of therapy. Additionally, I would often find myself in relationships with women, who were horribly abusive and did some pretty shit things, further hurting my self esteem that i would allow my self to be treated like that. So, i guess i feel since that I have allowed people to treat me as if i had 0 self worth for so long, that i feel like new great people wont possibly feel different. Additionally, I have alot of anxiety that alot of people may think I am crazy/emotionally unstable if tot hear of some of my situations in the past and i have stopped interacting with new people simply out of this fear. i guess my difficulty, is that if i was overweight, I would feel like atleast i could put a plan into place where i could logically lose the weight and help me feel better. however, i have maxed out everything that i can improve that way(body, finances).

Lately I've noticed myself getting into a lot more dangerous situations I think maybe because I feel a need to have control over my own death, and that getting in random fights with junkies on the subway and getting hit by cars when chasing the bus excites me because my life (or death) isn't in my control.

I know I'm young but at this rate I'll just be living with my mom until I die. I don't know how to fix this. This is the worst. My health has deteriorated as well. I've gained about 50 pounds and have a poor diet in general. I always feel like shit. I know the solution is to just stop eating so much but it's hard when food is the only thing that makes you feel good.,0,0

Looking for someone who understands the life of a depressed, and doesn't give stupid advice like ""it's all in your head, you just have to think positive"". Someone who doesn't give up on you no matter what. I'm specifically looking for a best friend instead of friend because most of the time, people don't take online friendships seriously. But I do.

INFP, for any myer-briggs fans out there. I'm probably the most emotional person you'll ever see. My heart totally rules my head. But I do have morals which keeps me sane of course. I get attached pretty easily, and I'm pretty clingy. Maybe a bit too much for normal people to handle...

With the New Year approaching, as well as getting back to normality and work after the Christmas break, I feel even more down and worried, particularly about my lack of resilience. A bit of a background - about 4 months I moved with my partner pretty much half way around the world. It was a move we both definitely wanted and I have no regrets at all from that - however it's again where I think my resilience decided to leave me. I also need to travel weekly (only usually the first three days of each week, so two nights pretty much) for work - it was either that or they said 6 months of little to do within state... I think being bored 9-5 is even more depressing!

I'm struggling with the flying (I'm already a little anxious but it now feels much worse), I struggle with being alone and away from my other half, I struggle a little with being away from home.

"In the last month I spent my birthday, Christmas, and new year entirely alone. I likely failed at least one of my exams.

I told everyone I was too busy, but the truth is I was too anxious to leave my apartment. It felt too much like I was just failing. Three months ago is when I discovered that my depression may be caused by a chronic vitamin deficiency, which I would have been suffering from for over 10 years without knowing. A disorder that could have equally significant impact on my brain and body, which it may have already. This month I'm going to get checked to see if I'm right. If I am, then my dream career is a bust. If I'm wrong, I'm right back to square one and most likely going to end it. I'm in a lose-lose situation. The only thing keeping me going anymore is the fact that I don't know how my friend would handle it. She has big dreams that she can absolutely attain, but if she cares about me even a fraction as much as I care about her then coping with my death could ruin everything.

"Hi, I'm extremely sorry if this isn't allowed but I have gone through depression all my life and this is honestly just a breaking point for me. I'm a 19 year old female going through a really hard 1 sided breakup. We were together for more than a year, I miss him more than you could ever imagine and my emotions are all over the place.. He stole around 300$ from me right before he left and has done so many horrible things but I can't help but love him. I made a few mistakes after he did and he said this was the reason. He wanted to have a friends with benefits relationship right afterwards.. I almost fell for it because I wanted him. I felt empty before and I just feel completely numb and empty now, I don't have 1 second of happiness anymore and I just don't want to live through it. The pain is so fucking BAD. I miss how he made me feel, physically and mentally. I take medication for depression, see a therapist, and have extreme social anxiety. He helped me so much and I have nothing to hold onto anymore. I'm seriously broken. I guess I just want to talk to someone who is going through the same thing so we can go through it together? I don't even know what I'm saying. I don't have many friends I just really.. . really need someone right now. Thanks for reading.",1,0
"I've felt this way for a very long time. The feeling of inadequacy, the contempt of others, the anger, and the overwhelming loneliness. For such a long time, I've kept it bottled up, but now its beginning to boil over and I don't know how to handle it. This is my first time admitting to this and I think its easier to admit in anonymity than to my family. They wouldn't understand these feelings and I inevitably chase all of my friends away. I have no hobbies or anything that I am good at so I just wallow in my sadness. I dont want to be so absorbed in my own issues but its hard to overlook when it begins to bleed over into the things I used to care about like school. Being alive has never been a feeling that I can remember feeling happy about.I've come to live with pain and failure but I would just like the feeling to stop and feel even a modicum of ""okay-ness.""

Not only that but there are these people in my computing class who started out being my friends but slowly I think they are just starting to bully me too, there was this picture I uploaded 2 years ago to my Instagram of me in a onesie that they keep teasing me about, they even went so far as to print it off and put it in my pocket so as to piss my off when I find it. I really don't want to go back to college as I don't want to face all of this again, i really think it's going to break me and pull me back to cutting and sucical thoughts, even though the thoughts have already started again.

I didn't ask to be thrust into this fucking world without any say. I can't stop thinking about how life is just too painful to not be worth it at all. It's not, really. It sucks that I'd hurt so many people if I died, and it makes me angry that I have this shit holding me back from ending it all. I know they'd feel a certain way. But what about my feelings?! Why should I push through just so everyone around me can feel okay?",0,1

"Most of the time it‚Äôs the opposite, but sometimes, when I get really depressed, I want to have sex or pleasure myself as much as I possibly can. I just feel worse afterwards, but I always do it. Don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs like that sometimes. Perplexes me. Anyone have a similar experience? Just wanted to share.",0,0
"shits been rough for a long long time, but 2017 was better for me in a lot of ways. I think 2018 might finally be the year I get out of this hole and start enjoying life here's to hoping, at least",0,0
"I have no happiness in my life at all, I try and distance myself emotionally from my family because it's easier that way than feeling guilt and them not understanding. Not even music or tv shows give me a moment of happiness I just feel disgust and more sadness. It would just be better if I died Usually I use music and tv as a coping mechanism In trying to destruct myself but it's not working anymore and I'm scared at this point",1,1
