"Hi I don't really know how to phrase this situation but I'll try. My life is at a really good point right now, I'm never really depressed over stuff and 99 percent of the time my mind is clear. I'm about to graduate high school and I'm really excited. However, people in my family and friend group have tons of issues. Wether they sleep all day, hate themselves, or have no ambition to keep living on in this world, they've got problems. I don't wanna sound like I'm gloating, but usually I'm the person that a lot of these people end up going to because usually I'm able to talk people through issues and help them in the long run. Yeah sometimes their issues make me really sad and stuff because who doesn't feel sad when people are telling you they feel worthless.

But today one of my best friends showed me that he was cutting and it really effected me. I talked to him about it and it's mostly because of how painfully ""bored"" he is and he doesn't even know why he's doing it (he's a pretty logical guy). He will go to class and just sit there for and hour most of the time doing nothing challenging because that's the way our school works. He has clinically diagnosed depression, has been to a psychiatric ward, and sees a therapist regularly. It's only been a couple hours since he showed me his arm, and I didn't even see all of it. 

I've got two main problems right now. First I don't really know how to help him. He said literally the only thing I can really do is just hang out with him after school and on the weekends so he doesn't just sit in bed all day. I've been trying to make an effort to do that as much as I can but I need to do more. He said himself that as long as he goes to highschool, and considering it's the law, he's going to feel this way until we graduate. I just need to know something I can do to help him, do I tell his parents? A therapist won't help he already goes to one. Should I talk to him more about it tomorrow. I just don't know

Second, stuff like this is really effecting me. I just feel that the world is being unfair to everyone I care about and I just want everyone I love to feel better. As of lately I've been feeling depressed whenever my friends need to talk about issues and it's really weighing down on me. I just don't want to leave the people I care about down in the dirt. 

So yeah if anyone has any advice whatsoever please help me. Im normally able to deal with these feelings and help my friends but right now I'm struggling. Thank you â¤ï¸",5
i have been so depressed these past couple weeks ever since i got back from vacation normal life and reality has hit me and its terrible. im 19 i havent moved out yet i dont really have a sufficient job i have one but its not enough money for me to support myself. at least i have a car and im taking online classes so. i feel stuck in this stupid fucking town. empty and alone man i just want someone to love me dude but im ugly and fat and worthless and no one is ever going to see im worth the chance. its just one thing after another to worry about. why not end it now before i really fuck up and become miserable? i dont see the point in going on im just really down right now i dont know what to do )): all there is darkness idk how to get out of this hole i hate myself i hate my body i hate my life i dont think it will ever get better,1
"Hi..I don't know where else to go. I am devastated right now, feeling like I'm spiraling out of control, I feel so fucking numb from crying my lungs out. Even my best friend is no longer supportive, my family, parents at home are shit. I have no real friends who care, and I can't be bothered to do anything right now, I just want to sleep without waking up to see another morning. I feel so fucking pathetic and shit, I cut myself regularly now and I'm having so much fucking self pity, I'm pretending to be normal because I don't want to lose my best friend, the only person who has helped me come this far from previous suicidal attempts. But suppressing it makes it so much fucking worse I feel like nobody fucking cares, no matter how many times I shout for help. No one close to me cares. I don't know what to do. I'm leaning towards paracetamol poisoning all over again, if I die I die, If I don't I try a different method. I just feel like absolute shit, jobless. I regret everything in my life, every fucking thing, I don't know who to trust anymore, I don't even have a fucking shoulder to lean on while crying my lungs out. Im in a LDR, from past 6 months, (not prior to that) as she's studying overseas, I can't even fucking have her hold me in her arms when I'm feeling like shit. She is the best and supportive, and my best friend but I can't hurt her by harming myself so It's a fucking struggle. I just feel so enraged and angry at everything..I can't fucking find a job due to covid-19. Sometimes it feels like If I had some money to get myself kicked off I can go near her and find a job and at least stay sane. But right now it all seems so fucking impossible I feel like I'm such a fucking mess and I just wish to fucking die right now, I feel so much burden when I inhale, I just want to die. I got no where else to go. I am planning on consuming meds tonight I just can't do it anymore.",5
"The shit like â€œit will get better, everyone is here for a purpose you just need to find yours.â€ Or â€œit will get better just wait, one day you'll be glad you didn't kill your self.â€ And of course the suicide is a permanent solution blah blah blah fuck shit. Even better, for people with religion say , â€œjust prayâ€ 

Suicidal people are tired of hearing the same generic shit. That's why we don't open up.",0
"I wish I was prettier. I wish I didn't feel like a burden, I wish I wasn't so broken. I wish I was more charismatic and not weird around strangers and I wish I wasn't so nice. I wish I didn't feel like I'm a loser with a pathetic, boring life. I wish I wasn't so hard to make friends with and I just wish I was different.",1
"This is a weird question, but is there someplace I can call and talk to someone before I go? I don't want to be talked out of it. I just want one last, good conversation.",5
"I'm just venting into the void because I feel bad for constantly annoying my friends but I has an epiphany 20 minutes ago that like...yeah I'm absolutely going to die single and unloved. I have friends and family but literally no one wants me romantically. All I attract are toxic folks that just suck the energy out of me. I just had to cut things off with this guy I was really into because I realized he just used me and didn't care about me but now I'm like maybe I should just stick with him but at least I can pretend he cares about me. Or at least wants to fuck me. That's probably the best I can get. 
I'm never going to have a healthy romantic relationship and I'm gonna learn to accept that but for tonight...I cry. 
I'm just too ugly. Not interesting enough. Not funny enough. Not thin enough. My ass isn't fat enough. Waist aint small enough. Not smart enough. 

But hey in a few years I'll have a kid on my own and I'll pour all the love I never had into the lil human so they don't end up like me. Broken and unlovable. 


I'm spiraling.",4
"Hey guys. Last week, i went through the roughest day that ocd has ever thrown at me, which pushed me to finally tell my mom that I was going through severe anxiety (OCD) and I didn't know what to do anymore.

I can't walk down the street without worrying about whether or not I knocked someone over without realizing it, or bumped someone into the road without realizing it, or worrying about a rabid animal biting me without realizing it and dying from rabies, or worrying about stepping on a needle infected with HIV, or worrying about a homeless person infecting me with HIV/something worse without me realizing it.

I can't drive without worrying about whether I hit a pedestrian without realizing it on that right turn, or that left turn, or if that green light was really green or did I just run a red light and run over a pedestrian crossing without realizing it?

I can't get near moving water without worrying about the brain eating amoeba. If I get splashed in the face, Ill freak out internally for the rest of the day. I can't eat food without worrying about it being poisoned or worrying about tapeworms.

I can't have a basic conversation without worrying about whether something I say will come back to haunt me

I KNOW these things are stupid and will probably never happen, but my brain keeps on throwing me the â€œwhat if?â€ and I won't be able to move on. I'll even get physically affected by my anxiety- my eyes will burn and it will get harder to breathe

Anyway, my mom set up an appointment for a psychiatrist (I'm 18 and I'm still not smart enough/have enough money to set one up myself, I feel worthless already, pls don't remind me) and I went there today.

The guy seemed like a good guy and everything, and made me sign paperwork as I was talking to him and everything, and everything was cool. On the way out, my mom asked the guy how much the bill would be, and he said it would be around 300 dollars for the first visit and around 150 for every visit after that.

I've been so upset ever since. I feel so bad. I told my mom I didn't feel good going to a psychiatrist if it would be that expensive, but she's super super supportive and insists on me getting help (she goes through anxiety too, to a lesser extent).

Then, my brain got the idea that what if the papers the guy made me sign was really a contract that would come back to haunt me later (ex-what if I signed away part of my future income,etc.) it sounds so stupid and it is. My brain just sees everything as a threat and is stuck in a perpetual fight or flight mode

Anyway, I don't know what to do. I feel Iike for the past eight months I've just been a drain on my parents and everyone around me. All I am is a burden that can't even make myself happy. I feel like if I don't go to anymore appointments with this psychiatrist, I'll have thrown away 300 bucks of my mom's money for no reason, but if I do go to another appointment with him, I'll cost her 150 a pop. I feel like I'm taking advantage of people and I feel like I'm too stupid to get my act together. I just want to be able to be happy again and have peace of mind. I've watched myself literally go nuts and I don't know what to do anymore. To add to it, this is all in my head. I can't even tell reality from obsession anymore. This whole battle that I've fought for the last eight months is all in my head. I'm not doing anything productive by fighting OCD. I'm just wasting my time and I feel like ocd is just my excuse for being worthless. I just feel so hopeless and guilty.",3
"I don't know when I will pass. I don't know how many people will know or care. I only want this to say to my parents and siblings and all relatives: I'm sorry. I'm greatly sorry. I will miss you all. But, I cannot continue the journey. 

I wasn't blessed with looks, brains, talents, or really anything. My passions fizzle out and every ounce of optimism is but a coping tool for misery. I cannot continue down this road. All of those who pass me by, I know I wasn't worth your time, but just know how blessed you are. With looks, brains, talents. 

Deep down maybe it is just a series of self inflicted devilish mistakes in manipulation and childhood traumas of sexual and psychological bias. I blame myself wholeheartedly for all my actions and I blame myself for the actions made against me. I am a wretch. I am terrible. 

The only thing I can die with is hoping to meet a loving God. Or perhaps that I was a lonely god. One who created a world from loneliness. One who dreamt it all up. But, with all the suffering and pain and lost desires, God may have forsaken me. And if this is just a Dream then i made one terrible dream. 

I don't really want to die. But I need to. It's time I must be going. Mom, everytime you see anything that reminds you of me. Know that I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. 

With love, 
Another",1
Been fighting with depression for a couple of years now and it has been an uphill battle. Just talked to my doctor yesterday and got diagnosed with bipolar on top of my PTSD from the military. I'm so scared and feel like I have no one to talk to about it. I'm afraid of reaching out to friends out of fear of them leaving me. I only have my brother and I'm scared of how he's going to react since our mother had bipolar as well and ended up committing suicide when I was 15 and he was 18. I just want to be normal and be able to talk about this with someone. Anyone that knows what I'm going through or would like to reach out is appreciated.,5
"I don't talk to any of my friends I leave them on read for months, makes me feel like absolute dog shit. I've failed multiple classes and this semester I only have 6 credit hours, still well on the way to failing. I can't get out of bed much less actually do class work. I'm probably gonna end up dropping out of college I don't know what I would do after, I really wish something would just kill me. I'm surrounded by so many caring people but I just push them all away, soon I'll end up alone and that's what I deserve. I've tried so fucking hard to get better it doesn't do anything. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I've had such a perfect life anyone else in my shoes would be so successful and happy then there's me just rotting away in my bed for literally no god damn reason. I just want to fall asleep and never wake up.",2
"I have no one to talk to. I am 30 years old. I had a girlfrend. We were together for 8 years. We were talking about getting merried, move together. But last week she said she is leaving me. I am broken. Now I do not know how to move on. I realised that i do not have friends, have to live with my parents, have a job which I hate. Why should I live. When i wake up in the morning my first taught is to kill myself. I was thinkig abot killing myself before. But now i am serious about suicide. I will just go and buy a rope and hang myself. Who would miss me? Nobody. It would be better for everyone if i was death. I see a lot of people with perfect lives. Why i can not be like them. I do not know what to do.",4
"Today's the day to get out of bed! Get off that couch, or get the hell out of that chair, y'all. Start by sitting up wherever you are right this second. 

Right now, I want you to take a deep breath in through your nose, and slowly breathe it out through your mouth. Take another deep breath in, this time focus on the roof of your mouth and your tongue; relax those muscles, let your tongue fall away from the roof of your mouth, and breathe all the way out. Repeat this breathing technique, focusing further on your lungs and your rib cage. Feel each breath slowly touching your nostrils, pulling downward into your chest, filling your lungs. Consider your posture now, letting your shoulders roll back and your neck pull up as your lungs fill with fresh air. 

Your body is likely sore from sleeping too much, or not enough, and I know that story all too well. 

You're alive today, and I challenge you to stand up, stretch the body your mind has been neglecting, and get into the shower. Practice the breathing technique in the shower or a hot bath, being mindful of how your body feels. Listen to it when it speaks today. You've got this!",0
"I used to be perfectly normal and then Physics hit me. I am constantly flunking tests and even when I'm relaxing or watching tv I either feel ok or literally want to vanish and hang my self. I get a lot of mood swings going from neutral, happy, sad with neutral and super sad everyday. I always hold a happy face literally acting ok and happy and I can't take it. No one really cares about me anyway and it feels unbearable or I'm quite happy. It's been 2 years of this and I'm seriously might end it but subconsciously I feel like if I tell someone it is making me seem like a wimp for not being able to do it and dishonours real depressed people. But the only thing that keeps me going is setting goals like I want to be a programmer or play video games or my brother.",2
"I've bought this all on myself. I have a porn and sex addiction that has lead me to chest on my girlfriend. We have decided to try and make it work but I can't stop the thoughts of regret and hatred to myself. I feel like the only thing that would help me and my girlfriend move on would be me out if the situation. I don't think I could physically go through with it but the thoughts are always there.

Not really looking for advice but happy to hear anything anyone has to say it's just been a help writing this down",3
"I can't anymore, I've tried for about 5 year now. All I got was kicks and punches from life. I fail daily tasks and cannot control myself. I hurt my surrounding and hate myself the most. I am suffering so much, yet I can't bring myself over to pull the trigger or cut with the knife. I've been going to therapy for a while but there's nothing changed, no help either. I'm thinking about taking an overdose of meds, but I don't know if it will work. If not I cannot live with the afterwards consequences I have to face. I cannot bear to live another single day either. 

I am just so done. 

If anyone I know sees this, thanks for nothing.
Thanks for thinking you're trying, yet you just secretly watched me slowly dying. 

I hope humanity gets eradicated within the next decades.",5
"I feel sick whenever someone praises me, or says anything optimistic directed towards me.

It feels disgusting, as if they're lying to my face. My mind tells me they have to be lying. They *have* to, else everything I've established in my head about myself is destroyed.

Can anyone relate?",1
"I always liked beauty. Probably the only thing that kept me from ending it all. But even it wasn't enough, isn't, most of the time. 
Sometimes the only thing that calms me is to plan how I'm going to do it. It came to a point that every time that I'm suicidal again the only thing stopping me is the complexity of the scene. I still don't have the right things, I can't go to the place, my hair isn't in the right length and etc. 
I never told anyone about it. I'm living between numbness and intense feelings that hurt too much. I feel like I'm wasting my privileges, I'm wasting my capacities, I don't want to, I don't know what to do. The best phases are when I'm hyper, but I get destructive and it's not ideal. 
I miss xanax but I'm tired of numbing it down. I'm tired of living like a nun, I'm tired of always having to control myself so much when I feel something. 
And I ask myself what is going to happen the day I have everything ready. Sometimes I wish it was today. Sometimes I just don't want to think about it. 

If someone knows a way out of this, I can listen. I'm always listening anyway.",1
"When I'm asleep I can't feel like I'm drowning like I constantly feel I am. I feel so empty and lost on a daily basis and just hide behind a fake smile. I don't have the drive anymore. I feel so alone in this world. Don't have anyone to talk to or anything.. I've asked my â€œfriendsâ€ if they wanted to go to six flags cause I have a season pass and can get people in super cheap
Or free and they all just dust me off. It's sucks.",5
"Like I am in so much pain but I can't seem to cry I just sit feeling so fucking numb and I just don't know how to feel anything. I have many reasons
To live but selfishly I do not care. I w a n t to d I e",5
"I was gonna drink some laundry detergent on the 5th of last month. So, I went to do the deed, and we were OUT. I was enraged. Now that I'm looking back on it, it might be a sign to keep living, but I really doubt that. I just wanna die, I can't even do that.",0
"Okay, here it goes. I don't really care if this isn't a throwaway account, it's whatever.

During the beginning of my teenage years, (13) I didn't care about anything, how i looked, or anything of that sort. Looking in mirrors was fine, and life was good.

When i hit 14 i sent a really horrible selfie of myself to a group of online friends, was bullied really bad for it, and so on. From then on i've been incredibly alert of myself, if you know what i mean. 

I stayed with this friend group because they were the only people i knew and could talk to, my parents hated me for being gay, and my brothers only took in their footsteps. After this, i just completely broke down, got so insecure that i wore a jacket for a year because i was so scared of anyone seeing me. That ended when i was 14. 

I stopped because i just decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and that i was the only problem in that situation. Since then, it's only gotten worse. I now spend all time i can get in my room, under a blanket, won't call anyone because i don't want anyone to hear how bad i sound, don't let anyone see me because of how bad i look, etc. 

I've attempted suicide once, and that one time my dad walked in on me trying to hang myself. I've given it lots of thought since then, and honestly, every day it feels like a better option.

I don't know why i'm posting this, something in me told me to post this here. Hope everyone reading this has a fantastic day, though.",1
"My brother is married, they're expecting a baby, and now it's as if my parents have written me off altogether. My dad visited recently, he stayed with my brother, and I went to visit them everyday. But I knew my dad wouldn't have missed me if I wasn't there. Even before he left he said to my brother and sister in law that it was great seeing them both. He then remembered I was there too and quickly said ""you three"". 

I've always known I'm the least favourite. The dispensible one. But to see that my dad actually might prefer my sister in law. I understand. I love her too. I suppose I failed at life and this is its way of pushing me out?",5
From the time i remember myself i would always think im stupid and ugly and everybody else is better. From the time i was 14-15 i would imagine how to end it all. Why is my life like this I've never done anything wrong to anyone. If reincarnation is a real thing I was a selfish person that wanted the world now im stuck.,1
"My life is probably the worst it's been in awhile. My parents basically tortured me as a child and now it's gotten to the point I don't talk to anyone. Not once. I used to be somewhat popular and have a lot of friends. Now since I've been here having suicidal thoughts and attempts, I pushed everyone away making me feel even worse it just feeds it self and I feel like the only out is death. Does anyone else feel this way?",4
"I used to fear death and have hypochondria. I guess I loved life so much that the prospect of losing it all was terrifying.

But now my life is so dull that I probably wouldn't lose as much if I died. I still fear death and the darkness of it all, but the fear has taken a backseat.

Is this a slippery slope towards suicidal thoughts? I'm not suicidal and couldn't imagine myself being suicidal.",3
"Nobody actually likes me, not a single person I know values me and has interest in me as a friend or a best friend , I just suck and I'm so easily replaced, I don't want to live anymore feeling this empty",5
"I really don't have any evidence on this, but I have this feeling my GF cheated (or still is) on me. I have told her about this and we try different things to strengthen the trust again but nothing really works. This is ruining our relationship that was going great until this. It all started with me thinking that my friend and her were very friendly with each other, plus they shared a lot in common. That idea grew in my head at one point I had convinced myself it was true. I don't know if it's true or not I confronted both of them, but of course they denied it. Doesn't help that my friend is always lying about things (small things at times) and after telling him the situation he hated me and began acting like a dick and showed me a side of him I never knew. I understand people will do and say things that they don't mean when mad but he said some mean things lol. We ended up talking things out after I almost fought him because of the slimy shit he did. At the time I thought it was real but now I think it was to avoid the fight.",4
It can always get better but it can always get worse too.,0
"I'm not happy, I feel alone while completely surrounded by people who love me. I read everything my boyfriend texts me the wrong way and feel as if he's constantly angry at me so i uust avoid telling him how i feel. I feel like a failure in my job, a failure with money a failure in general.
My therapy got cancelled because I missed two sessions (one because my appendix burst and the other because i had a breakdown and couldn't leave the house). I feel stagnant and unloved and stupid for thinking this way because theres no reason to why I should think like this.
Im at a loss.
I need someone to talk to, I can't outright ask for attention from anyone because then I'll be needy. I just have to keep plodding on but I cant plod on. I am trying and it is hurting me.
I wish i wasnt around anymore, I really do.
Im sorry reddit, I just needed somewhere to vent. I don't want to be a bother.
But any advice in terms of just getting eyour emotions to level out would be fab. If you've made it this far, I'm sorry for taking time out of your day for just moaning.",2
"Today's my birthday and in the single hour I've been awake, it's already been one of the shittiest days I've had these past few months. I'm fucking sick of being here and I just don't want to be here anymore god damnit. I just don't want to be doing this shit. 

I have a girlfriend who genuinely seems to care (no obligation to me or feels stuck with me) and I don't think I'd be here without her. 

I'm here... but to what benefit?",5
"you know how people always say ""you're lonely, not alone""? i really honestly feel like i'm just unable to become close to another human being - mutually.

i have a lot of people in my life who love me and want to be close to me. but i feel cold saying that i am either too overwhelmed by them or i don't feel close to them.

i cant bond with others anymore. i used to have stupid useless sex constantly that made me feel like a piece of meat to be consumed. now intimacy terrifies me.

closeness and hugs scare me. i'm extremely isolated and i only ever leave the house for my (extremely tough medical) school and to get food. debt is piling up because of that but its my only joy.

i cant stand people getting close to me. i cant stand hanging out with friends. but yet i want love and intimacy so badly. i feel like im so broken, and that i'm never going to feel like a human again.

i just feel like a vessel that serves as a stupid, servicing fleshlight to fuck. to only ever improve the quality of others - not me. i don't deserve it.

i just don't understand why i shouldn't just kill myself over spring break. that way if i survive, i have a week to be in the psych hospital and not miss any assignments or exams.",5
"I make fun of my friend for being skinny and punch her around. I jab at my other friend everytime she makes a little mistake. I'm an asshole. I just make fun of people out of instinct, and complain when people do the same to me. I'm a toxic ass hypocrite.

yet I complain, sit on my ass, and don't change.

ironic.",1
"If I made a list of the people I love it would be no one. If I made a list of my favorite songs it would be none. If I made a list of everything that I want to become and want to accomplish.. there would be no answer. All I feel is anxiety, fear, and pain. Eating makes me feel sick. I cant get more than a couple hours of sleep. I'm just ready to go and I dont care how it affects anyone.",5
"I have dysthymia and have dealt with suicidal ideation privately for years, but over the past 6 months and especially over the last 48 hours it has gotten really really bad. I feel like I am two people right now. One version is ready to go and has a solid plan for how to do it. The other version is horrified and sick at this. I am preventing myself from acting by reminding myself of how much I'm needed at work tomorrow, by thinking of how dependent my pet cat is on me, by imagining how much this will hurt my friends. The two sides are battling it out. I don't think I'll act on my suicidal thoughts tonight, but I may within the next few days. I don't know what to do.
I'm broke and can't handle an ER bill. I definitely can't go to family with this and I'm afraid to go to friends. I have a therapist but won't see her until Sunday.
I don't know what to do but I know I have to do something. Please suggest something",2
"I've already had a lot going on in my personal life, and I was closer to suicide than I'd ever been. Then there was a huge argument among my friends. I won't get into details, but I don't think they'll make up. I was right in the middle and now I need to fucking pick a side. But I don't want to pick a side. If I do I'll lose some of my friends, and I am neutral on the whole situation anyway. If I don't pick a side, I'll start spending more time with one group than the other because I hate changing things, and then they'll hate me. So I'm going to isolate. I won't sit with them in the morning or at lunch, I'll only work with them in class if they come to me, etc. If they want to talk to me they'll find me. I don't have any other friends, so I'll be completely alone. Of course, that'll only happen if I don't end up killing myself before the end of March break. I was so close to suicide before the argument, but now I'm pushed past my limit. I'll probably go for the next opportunity I get (i.e. know I'll be home alone for 2+ hours). I just can't take this anymore, it's all become too much. I don't really want to die, but nothing ever gets better so what's the point. I just give up.",4
I told my parents I loved them and that I was sorry. I told them its not their fault Im just tired of waking up and feeling like I'm in fight or flight every day all day. I told my girlfriend she should move on and find someone better who actually deserves her love. I told my friends thank you for being there sometimes but Im done fighting. I've lost the battle. Tomorrow is my last sunrise. Tomorrow night I'm out of here. Good bye all.,4
"Hey, I created an account because I honestly dont know what I am doing anymore on here. Last year was the worst of my life. My long time GF (4 years) and I broke up. She lives in a different state so I flew there to speak to her and atleast end it on good terms. The day after I started a new job. 

It started well with my manager happy but the next week I had another manager who joined (the person who hired me was sacked). Towards the end of the first month, I ended up having surgery on my back. This is where the issues started, The surgery and the breakup really affected me physically and mentally and I kept making errors which were easily avoidable. Eventually it got too much for them and they released me. 

It took me 3 years to find the job in my field which I graduated in and i honestly thought it was what I was looking for. Unfortunately, I got left with no job and now no partner. 

I have a job now - in my field but not exactly the same (if that makes sense) but it is really going nowhere. My manager is good and is happy with my performance but the organisation does not allow for any growth. The person who I replaced is younger than me and is already far ahead in their career than I will. To top it all off, I live in a small town and it will be hard to hide the termination.

I honestly dont know what is the point anymore. No matter what I do, it feels it is never enough and I am not going anywhere",4

i feel like no matter how hard i try when i make one step forward i'm always two steps back. it's so defeating and embarrassing,5
"I'm back here. Yay, getting ready to rant out my god awful useless problems instead of revise for my mocks; which 2 of my A-Levels I'm going to fail. I don't want to do extra years in college, it's fucking horrible. I'm again crying out for help despite me not accepting it, or no one even giving me help; instead I'm getting help from the internet ""Oh wow how original, last time you did that you fell into a greater depression.""
I hate my life, my family is horrible and struggling too. The world is fucked, people are disgusting; everyday I wish for a quick fucking death. I'm failing in school, I have no passion in what I do anymore and even better I don't know what I wanna be in the future.
God I don't know what to do with my life, I just wanna move out of England, go live a quiet life in Canada, somewhere where's there's no people, no problems and where I can die in peace. I don't know why I'm writing this. Again. For my own good I guess. I wish I could cry again, have a friend to talk to and feel open with. I miss my ex. Who was a fucking internet relationship that I fell deeply in love with. ""The retard has fallen in love with the E-boy"" how devilishly gay of me. I hate my life so much, god the thought of shoving a shotgun barrel into my mouth makes me so happy.
Please don't tell me ""it'll get better"" it won't. Life won't get better it will get worse. It has been. I don't really know why I said that because no one frankly cares about these posts, yeah you'll comment on one but after you don't know what will happen to them. It's funny, I went to one of those subreddits to make a friend in, and they fucking downvoted me. What a way to boost my confidence Internet. And make a friend. Fuck I hate myself.
I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I want to sleep forever, I don't want to wake up tommorow to do my mock. I know I'll fail it. I'm a fucking failure.
Ask for help? I'm too worthless to ask, I won't accept it, I have too high standards or whatever. Idk. I've become the very thing I've sworn to destroy and that's a depressed sad fucking failure. I don't know what to do.
I'm just another one of the millions asking for help only to not take it. I'm unmotivated to do anything. God I want to cry so much.
I should stop, go look at some stupid pointless memes, suffer and regret my decisions and go look at my ex's profile for the 10th time this week. I hate myself and my life.
Yeah thanks for reading this if you did.
But to be frankly honest why would you waste the time. How would you even fucking reply to this.",4
Here i am in bed holding a knife its been like an hour that im trying to get to courage just to stab myself in the carotid artery already wrote a suicide note and everything but im such a coward i just cant do it fuck fuck fuck i dont wanna live in this nightmare anymore i dont wanna wake for tomorrow everyday day is the same shitty day,5
"I'm a 21 year old and my birthday is in two week's (st.Patrick's day), my entire life has been rough. From the moment I was born I had heart issue's and growing up I had a growth deficiency, to then my ribs growing in words and crushing my lung's along with asthma. That's just a small portion but it sums it up. From losing my dad at 15 when I finally was at an age to do thing's he liked which I developed a love for because I got to hangout with him, to then never being able to do them again and having to retire from hockey and sports because my lungs are so small due to my chest issues. Everyone left, I had nobody when I lost my dad, I spent years silent, didn't talk to anyone, same racial expression everyday. I dragged myself out of the hole, then life continues and people keep coming and going and destroying me on the way out with friends betraying me and relationships being cheated on. I've never been good enough for anyone. My mother doesn't speak to me anymore, she'll go through my siblings to contact me. She also moved across the usa. Finally I've hit a point where I just don't want to keep praying for better dayâ€˜s. It's been 6 years of in and out of hospitals for mental issues and thing's just never get better. I then lost my best friends dad from cancer whose family took me in when I was on the brink of ending it all and they helped me get better and it worked until my previous relationship. I mean I was happy again. Like I felt normal. I wasn't crying every morning and every night. I was excited for the day. But it's been about 9 months since that and I've cut the world off and I haven't spoke to anyone in week's bc nobody ever tried to contact me and it was always me reaching out so I stop tried. I have no confidence left and I have no chill anymore, I'm just the guy that's there with his headphones in always. I'm tired. I can't seem to do anything right. I just want to be at peace, I don't want to be here but I can't do that to my siblings. Even tho we don't get along well I don't want them to enter a depressed state like I've gone through for years. I'm just running out of energy and idk how much longer I can do it until I just say fuck it and be done and end it, end my pain. Nobody seem's to care about my pain so idk why I should care about anyone else's anymore. I've always been the person who will help anyone even if I barely know them. But nobody does it for me..",4
All my friends live out of town. I had to go no contact with my mom again. Usually the only person i speak to on the day to day is my 8 yr old. Im 29 and don't know how to make friends. Occasionally someone moe extroverted will make friends with me but it always ends with them taking advantage of my kindness so i have to drop them from my life. Im tired of being alone. Im tired of being disabled. Im tired of all my mental illnesses. Im tired of wanting to die. I need to be held so bad. A judge once told my mom she shouldn't have had kids. He was right. I didn't ask for this. Im in therapy and on antidepressants but its not enough. I just want it to be over.,4
I'm 26. I feel swallowed in regret &amp; Shame. It keeps nagging me to reconnect with old friends &amp; associates. I haven't spoke to them in over a decade. I genuinely care about their well being but for some reason it'll feel fake of me. I can't enjoy the present with my family &amp; friends. I get bored or lose interest &amp; will feel sad out of nowhere. Anybody been through this? Or know how to move forward?,5
"I want to talk to someone, anyone, with a desperate fervour. The subject doesn't matter, as long as the person is interested in talking to me.
I honestly can't remember a time when I *didn't* feel so alone, but lately it seems to have gotten even worse. Even people whom I once thought my friends seem to have lost any interest in me. I want to talk to *someone.*
But I also can't tell anyone about this, because I worry that they will only speak to me out of pity or a misguided sympathy.
I do not want either of those, I can not stand the mere thought of them. All I want, is to be genuinely liked. But I feel like I don't *have* anything to be liked for: I'm not funny, I'm not smart, I'm not charming, I can't even listen to people that well. Who would ever *want* to befriend me?",5
"I've been feeling depressed af the last few months, it sort of feels like a relapse after about 6 months of a reasonably healthy mental state.

Basically I feel physically drained of energy all day, I have zero motivation to study or try in any way whatsoever in college. I'm doing a notoriously tough course and barely passed my Christmas exams. I come home exhausted but when I go to bed I just become really agitated and irritated. My heart starts pounding and I struggle to breathe, I can't get comfortable and even if go to bed exhausted at 8/9pm I wouldn't get to sleep until 2/3am. However in the mornings I struggle so much to get out of bed, I feel like there's almost zero point getting up anyway as I wouldn't even miss out on anything. I end up missing so many of my lectures simply becuase I cannot bring myself to get out of bed. I still live at home going to college but if I lived by myself without parents I could see myself just staying in bed/my room for days at a time. 

Every day passes by in a sort of blur for me, I feel like I almost have a depersonalization disorder as I just operate in autopilot. I feel like a shell, it's almost like I'm just empty inside; I don't feel emotions, everything just feels monotonous and numb. Honestly I really just don't give a fuck about anything anymore. I used to have passions like playing music/sport/reading/films etc but nothing excites me anymore. I feel like I don't really have an emotional outlet, it's like I'm just existing day-to-day without actually living. Since I find close to zero pleasure in general life I self-medicate with weed; I guess it's just a coping mechanism in order to feel something other than numb. I also think I have memory loss, as the last couple months have really blurred, I honestly don't know where the time has gone or what I've been doing in that time. 

I also have really really bad eating habits, I don't generally eat breakfast and then could go the day without eating. However when I come home I often would binge until I struggle to breathe. 

I also feel socially exhausted every day I have to go into college; pretending to be someone I'm not is mentally draining as I feel like I'm putting on a fake persona just to mask the numbness when all I wanna do is just go to bed/get high. This is probably part of the reason I avoid going to lectures. 

This all eventually caused me to go to the student couseling services in my college sometime last week, however I feel like I wasnt as honest as I should have been regarding my situation, I was definitely making it out to be less severe than it actually is. They set me up with counselling sessions that start in 3 weeks. 

However I feel like my ability to function has been severely impaired in the last few days. Tonight I felt the urge to self-harm for the first time and honestly if I had clean razors I would already have done so. I don't think I can wait 3 weeks for my counselling appointment, I feel like I should go to a GP/psychiatrist and see what they think. I feel like I just want someone to tell me exactly what I have, I'm 99% sure it's depression, and perhaps symptomatic insomnia/a binge eating disorder. I guess part of me still denies it's depression despite me knowing that it almost certainly is and I feel like I need a medical professional to tell me how it is in order for me to be able to work on getting better. I guess I also want to see if they think that medication could help too. Ultimately I just want treatment as soon as possible, something concrete I can show to myself to tell me that I'm taking steps to improve myself as atm I feel so lost in life, and I feel like a breakingpoint might come soon unless I change things. 

I really don't know where to go from here, I guess this post is just a reflection. Maybe I just want to get my thoughts down somewhere but if anyone has any advice obviously I'd rly appreciate that: like most ppl here I just wanna feel normal again. :( If anyone would be willing to talk about things a bit more in detail I'd appreciate a pm.",2
"So this is getting straight out of fucking hand. I'm a young male, studying and I feel like whatever's this feeling (Anxiety? Depression? Stress? I have no fucking clue!) Is catching up with me. Now: supposedly I have a loving family, friends.... All that shit you already know. But I don't want to talk to them, not even my gf, in whom I'd trust almost anything. Grades are fucking reverse skyrocketing. I CAN'T get myself to sit down and study shit. I'm probably going to fail music, even although I have been taught music in a music school for about 7 years. I just don't understand some subjects and probably won't at all. Worst part is we are having a trip to Ireland before the summer break, and you are automatically chosen out if you fail 2 or more subjects. I will probably fail French, Music, Spanish, Math, and most likely Physics and chemistry. Now, of all of those I just used to struggle with math BTW.

So just recently I've started cutting myself again. Not serious wounds straight in the veins. But cuts in my left hand and arm which stay there for quite a while. I will most likely continue doing so as my grades keep coming in. I will most likely get any source of music taken away from me (PC, Mp3, Phone....) And this won't help at all with the situation. 

Also recently I started going out with a girl I liked since 2-3 years ago, and she has liked me for the same time. This is the first relationship for both of us. None of us has ever kissed, made out with anyone, etc. And we are both really shy. And I have had friends since the start of the relationship (We've been together for 3 months now) trying to pressure both of us into making out. I, as the coward I am, obviously couldn't make it happen despite her FUCKING TELLING ME SHE WANTS TO. 

And I've also had quite a high number of suicidal thoughts lately. Mostly think of how could I do it...
Think of hanging myself, OD to death, find a gun somewhere (not common at all in my country) and blow my head off, cut myself, tie a rope around my neck and stretch it so hard I die, sealing my swimming pool while turning on the water for it to slowly rise and drown me, put a toaster with me in the bath.... I'm quite creative, really....

Also I've been finding it hard to find reasons to stay alive. I feel like a burden for my GF and family, only see myself as a weight they must lift to carry on and never, ever, feel like doing something useful that someone would be thankful for.",2
"I know it's really dumb to keep spamming and spamming, I've already made two other posts here. Unless it was actually three and I have the memory of a goldfish. I just feel alone as hell and I need to vent. Again. I'm pissed at myself for eating today. The plan was not to eat anything this month but I fucked that up. Hopefully, starting tomorrow, I'll be able to control my fatass self and not eat until April. And I started cutting again today so that's great. But I'm actually so fucking pathetic that I can't even cut that deep because it hurts too much. I cut my neck which is just dumb as hell since the neck is difficult to cover. The sad part is that a small part of me wants people to see. That's super fucked up, why would I want that? I have an appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow. Hopefully he can give me meds that actually work. That is my last hope. Otherwise suicide is my only option, if I just have the guts to go through with it. I don't know why I keep ranting but thanks for reading.",4
"So this is my first reddit post, so bear with me. I am not suicidal, so I don't want anyone to think I am in dire need of assistance. I don't want to scare anyone. But I do have depression, for 2-3 years now. I wrote a journal entry today that kind of illustrates how i constantly feel. 24/7. I've been journaling on and off for maybe 6 years, but tonight, after 7 months of not writing, I just felt this urgent need to put my feelings to pen and paper. Reading it back, its kind of scary (knowing myself) how dark it is, if that makes sense? I don't really know why I'm posting it. Maybe someone out there will say 'SAME BITCH I FEEL THE SAME FUCKIN WAYYYYY'??? Who knows. Anyways, here goes:

&amp;#x200B;

What does it mean when you feel so sad/lost/hopeless, but none of your friends or family seem to notice? To be constantly around people, but to feel so alone? To feel like you're being sucked into this black hole, but no one is around to help you out? To not really know how you feel? To wishing you were brave enough to tell other how you're feeling? To reach out for help? But at the same time, feeling hurt because nobody seems to care? To want someone to look into your eyes and see the sadness and tell you it's going to be okay? For the ones 'closest' to you to hear the lie in your laugh? To feel alone? Abandoned? Like you'll never be happy again? To be so scared that you'll feel this sad and lonely forever? Sometimes I really wonder if there is a single person out there that cares about my feelings, about my health, about my state of mind. I try so hard to be shoulder to cry on for my loved ones, to be a support system. But what about me? I've spent my whole life putting other people's needs before my own, and now that I'm trying SO HARD to focus on myself and put my needs first, I'm alone. Even the few people I've shared my feelings with are nowhere to be seen. What's the point in sharing if nobody cares? Because nobody cares, right? I think it's pretty obvious at this point. So what do you do when you have no support system? No one in your corner to encourage you? To fight for you? To fight FOR you? When there's no one to tell you 'it's going to be okay'? To give you a hug while you cry? Because you're always crying. I don't know. I just want my smile to be real again.",5
"I just need some interaction, I'm trying really hard not to cut myself right now. I'm addicted and it's a problem. My day was shitty, but I'd like to hear about yours.",4
"I've been feeling incredibly lonely recently. My psychiatrist can't see me until next Friday (she isn't covered under my insurance).

TL;DR Tell me some kindness you've witnessed or received.

I have been unemployed since December and I was holding on until I got my tax refund so I could see my psychiatrist for new meds, fixing my car, anything until I can get another job. Then the government took it all for student loans.

I used all my energy and grit to get here, only to be still stranded and lower than ever. I don't talk to my friends anymore about it because they just think being strong is the key and that I will be fine. I don't feel fine. I used everything up and now I am here, jobless, broke, and not even caring to take care of myself anymore. What's the point, you know?

I would like to hear some kindnesses you've witnessed. I've given up thinking anything good will happen to me (after three years of being kicked in the teeth every three weeks) but I want to hear how the world is still a good place.",2
"Last year I was a freshman in highshighschool. Near the end I was ready. I was gonna do it then one of the people told my mom and got me help. I told 3 people john, alex, and gabriel. Kohn said he would help me but lied. Alex did nothing and gabriel helped me. A few nights ago john texted me. This is our conversation.



John: I know you hate and despise me with a passion, But I must ask, Why? I just kinda needed some clearence. I'm not here to pick a fight with you, but to come to an understanding, So looks like u have spent 10 mins typing, I guess I can expect a bomb drop on me or som.

Me: I was on the verge of suicide and u said u would do something u promised and I hoped deep down someone would I was going to kill my fucking self on the 13 of july that year stab in the heart with a fuckin knife u promised me someone who I dispite all other judgement thought was a good if not the closest friend I had u did nothing u would've let me die it was gabriel the one who I thought wouldn't give a shit because of all the shit we went through it was him who got me the fucking help I hate u so fuck much so so much with all my fucking heart every muscle and bone and tendon and bit of flesh burns with hatred when i even think about u and the worst part is i cant unthink it I cant just forget an entire year cause I fuckin would forget u exist forget the entirety of 8th grade then some more u go around saying oh jay was just faking it he wanted the attention I was going to fuckin die and u were gonna sit there and watch with ur thumb up ur ass like some sorta fuckin beast of the fields then u come back to me and ask what I did wrong why do u hate me like that's a question then ur not even gonna say sorry u weren't just a shitty friend ur a shitty person and I made it my mission now to stop people from making the same mistake I did trusting u fuck I was a goddamn idiot but it doesn't even matter now I know where everyone stands when I asked them to pick a side a while back and they said they were with me only to lie and be with u I know now I only hate 3 things u Hitler and satan and u u didnt even do just that u hit ur brother u shot at me with a bb gun u hit my head with a bat and each time I tried to be a friend have someone by myside thought it would be u guess not then theres ur sarcasm again and I could keep going but ur rushing me so here


John: Well holy shit That was... Okay look man I'm honestly speechless But I need you to understand my perception I thought that you were just up to ur usual antics and I thought u were begging for attention, and I decided to not give you that attention. You aren't gonna believe me but I am honestly truly sorry if you felt and continue to feel this way I mean I never wanted any of this, I was led to believe that you had gone mad and I had to leave it at there Suicide is stupid by the way, I have considered that for myself in the past and I'm telling you it does not go well because those who have acted on that literally destroy their loved ones. You need to understand that I never wanted to hurt you in the way that you felt I just thought it was a bucket of bullshit, but I know realize you needed help Look I wanna clear the air here, I know you'll never consider me friend and that you hate my guts, but I want to make my peace with you and I want you to understand that I never hated you, and I am a man who believes in redemption There's nothing I can do, you clearly are a broken individual, I pray for your healing and I hope god watches you I hope that you seek help and that you talk to someone about this

Me: Horse shit

John: Ik that's what you think

Me: Need I continue Or do u wanna talk in person

John: Look man all I can say is god bless your soul, may his angels watch you, may you be free of this cursed darkness, and if you wanna talk in person I'm totally up for that

Me: Tomorrow freshman bathrooms by the commons around a lunch

John: I have a class I need to attend for and my schedule is kinda tight, but I could tomorrow morning at the main commons or som I believe you and I have a shared friend, Jake Maybe he could be present as we hash things out 

Me: No This is a u and me thing Fuck class

John: Of course, but listen if you wanna reach me, I'm around in the mornings or C lunch period

Me: Fuck that then

John: I kinda got fucked with the tardies rn so... I mean I'm open to discussing with you 

Me: Fuck ok 

John: I just need a time that works for both of us

Me: I'm just gonna say it all here

John: I can get on call if you like?

Me: Cant

John: Aight Then ig you just tell me here

Me: Shortened version 

Beginning of 9th grade I was completely alone u guys who were supposed to be my fuckin friends ran from me knew no one talked to no one only friend I had was jd and hes an ass on his own lowering my self esteem and all this went on for a month finally when I caught hold of u I invited u all to my birthday where everyone fucked off on their own leaving me once again alone to top that off all 3 of u alex gabriel and u tried to leave then homecoming where my past finally caught up to me I met someone we went on a date and it was ok I got to the house only to find some cunt who left the group who u took the place of and he told them everything about me how I hurt people without remorse and how I would so it again and how I was dangerous and shit they knew and I went with them they tried confronting me about it but I lied I hate liars and I lied to make that worse she was with someone else and I couldn't do shit about it when I go over to look for u bing notification everyone except me with the caption only friends I need or something I didnt have a ride home so I went back each question getting more and more personal until my dad came where I had to lie to him too and mom I knew I was alone then thought for a while then the idea slipped in for all but a second talked myself out ended the semester kicked out of 4 groups and our relationship starting to tear

Second half dad beat me mom beat me I wasnt doing well anywhere I went I was getting called a school shooter mick was getting away with everything and I was constantly at the bottom always mom thinks I'm gay humiliates me to the point of breaking down telling her I'm not only to find out later she didnt believe me start to lose friends over time get kicked out of sam billings table and im alone idea slips in I think on it for a bit longer before talking myself out again dad moves to Arizona leaving mom stressed jd convinces me I'm not a good person I give him a peice of my mind we dont talk for a bit I get in a fight lose and get made fun of for it the idea is set now stuck in my head I'm going to do this i need to mom humiliates me further but apologizes I know it's fake I say to myself I should probably tell the fuckers so they aren't blindsided gabriel snitches later that night and I have a difficult conversation with mom concerning my mental health I go to therapy over the summer

This year I come to school knowing jake over summer hoping I have at least lunch but no I no nobody I'm alone again I see Sam's tables broken up over schedules I say not again and assemble what I can every other persons telling me I'm gay kill myself or something I know I need to keep loving myself even if I'm alone then I get word that u were telling people I was saying I was going to kill myself for attention then the switch flipped I hate u always will I will never forgive u gabriel or alex never I bullshat my way into Jake's friend Austin's life stayed there expanded my group 

Now after thinking to myself why I'm even trying I realize u dont care ur a self centered asshole I had my fair share of toxicity but u took the cake and it was my fault for inviting u to the table now I see some freshman showing the same mannerisms as u and I know I need to stop it because u were a good friend but then u stopped and I dont understand that I don't get it why it doesn't matter the only one u care about is u and u will do anything to make sure u are ok or u come out on top like u have been but it doesn't matter I have the first real friend I had in a while a trustworthy group of friends and a gf lifes uphill only problem is u and I'm stuck on that cant shake it u aren't a good person idk if its u lashing out because of the divorce or u just think ur better than others or what anyways every part of my body wants u to burn in hell 
If that's too much to read listen to creep humility and magic city

John: I finished it all It was alot but I read it I don't what to say So you think I'm some narcisstic prick So much self pity man, and I have to say this really isnt healthy 

Me: Typical I said what I had to

John: You may not be able to forgive me, but you need to understand that this is not how any human being should live I wouldnt wish how you feel on my worst enemy

Me: I look for the good in everything I cant find any in u I said what i had to

John: I know Again you may think I'm some prideful narcisstic son on a bitch, but I do care about people, especially for those who are broken

Me: U are Look in a mirror and think long and hard about urself

John: I mean thats only how you view me There are millions of ways different people who see you You think I'm a bad man, and I accept your thoughts, I mean thats not who I am, but if thats the picture you painted then I'm sorry

Me: I'm an asshole that's how 80% of people see me and I'm ok with that But ask any one

John: My advice to you is find a light, be free, never let the pain, the darkness determine who you are

Me: Tell them answer honestly Dont therapize me

John: I'm happy that you met Jake, he is a truly great friend and is very supportive, I'm glad that you have someone like him in your life

Me: Fuck off with ur therapeutic bullshit

John: I'm not being your therapist, but the more you hang on to this hate and anger, than life will just be a major bummer I mean ur stubborn man

Me: Thing is I want to forgive and forget But I cant

John: And you can Thats ur choice

Me: U may be sorry now

John: U can let go of it all

Me: But that doesn't fix what ubdid U did*

John: What I did? Its all in ur head

Me: I will never forgive u

John: You painted this fucked up picture of me

Me: Or alex Or gabriel I will not because theres no good in u We all see ourselves as saints and our enemies as devils

John: I'm not your enemy

Me: To me ur just the shittyiest of shitty people U are John U are

John: Than thats a u problem

Me: U were about to let me die After u promised to be with me Then u lie

John: First of all suicide is an option and I never advised you to do that

Me: I told u And gabriel And alex Only u 3

Me: U were supposed to be my friend Just be my friend But u didnt and u cant and u won't

John: Well again thats a u issue Nothing I can do about that

Me: I can't do shit about that Change my view I'm just gonna let u know rn I mean every word I say

John: So ig we are not on good terms? And cannot change it

Me: I hate u and cant forgive u I'm sorry But what you did to me I cant forgive

John: Take care of yourself Jay, I hope you find your inner peace, I hope you can achieve your nirvana Goodbye

Me: Fuck off with that bullshit I'll get it eventually but I hope I dont see u again",4
"Recently, I've realized just how important variety and freshness is in everyday life. I know that many of the tips I will list below are not possible when you are in a particularly dark place, but I thought I'd mention them anyway â€” perhaps something will be of help to you. Here are a few things that help me keep overwhelming bouts of anxiety and ideation at bay: 

* Push yourself to wake up a little earlier. Stretch slowly with deep breaths and take a walk around your neighborhood as the sky turns rosy-yellow. Try to appreciate the new day; think of something, anything, to look forward to. Return home for a warm shower and freshly-laundered clothes.
* Sleep a little bit earlier. Wash your sheets and buy a few soft blankets to make your bed into a cozy sanctuary. Allot time for reading or journalling to clear your mind.
* Allot time to cook simple, lovely meals. Steam fresh vegetables, cook some rice, or cut up a fruit salad of apples, bananas, and citrus. Eat mindfully and drink plenty of water. 
* Buy a well-bound journal and a good quality pen. Write down achievable to-do lists, make calendars, note groceries, thoughts, haikus â€” anything. Put your thoughts in ink; appreciate daily observations. 
* Reorganize your space, or at least a little section of it. Listen to a nice podcast as you do so. Put your sheets and pillowcase into the laundry. Clear out your shelves and drawers, sort through everything, and replace it all neatly. Light a lovely candle and add some fresh flowers. Open a window or two.
* Buy or borrow a book on any topic which sparks even the slightest interest. Crocheting? Botany? Medieval history? Delving into a new topic just for the sake of it is worthwhile.
* Embrace non-competitive hobbies. This is incredibly important in a product(ivity)-obsessed society which devalues craftsmanship and pure interests. Activities like the following enrich your daily life and force you to set aside some time away from mandatory tasks: needle-felting, gardening, writing (poems, books, articles, blogs), painting, photography, wood-whittling, typography, graphic design, etc. Ensure that whatever you choose, the hobby involves holding the fruits of your labor in your hands. You do not have to be ""good"" at it â€“ this is not a career choice. Watching yourself grow and have fun with it is success in and of itself.

I hope you are doing well â€” I'm glad you are here, reading this. Wishing you warmth and support.",0
"oki so idrk why I'm doing this, ig maybe I'm just wallowing in self pity, but I rlly dont see why I should be alive anymore. my gf broke up with me, I no longer talk to my best friend, and I have good friends, i just feel so lonely all the time, like I'm drowning, and i feel like everyone is leaving me one by one and maybe it would help if i just died now because at least there would be someone who cared. what can I do?",4
I have a .22 five feet behind me all i have to do is pull back the slide load it and its ready to help exterminate my useless pathetic ass from existing. It will be the most useful act ill ever perform. So why am i such a pussy about it? Why am i such a pile of shit i cant even give myself the comfort i long for? Im sick of trying everyday knowing ill never be even mediocre. I just want it all to end .,5

"I haven't been sleeping much lately, I wake up with heavy drowsiness, despite not being able to fall asleep. I don't want to continue like this, I don't want to live if this is what life is.

My daily thoughts are riddled with shame, regret, disappointment, anger, and worry. There is so much I wish I had done differently, or not at all. I don't talk to anyone about it because no one would quite understand. It is much easier said than done to not compare oneself to others, forgive, or move on from the past. I haven't lived a day of my life at the age of 25 because of my circumstances and poor decision making.

I feel helpless and powerless. The world is hostile, overly competitive, and parasitic. The deluded turn to their illusions of grandeur via religion, but no loving god would allow this atrocity of a world. I don't feel I have a place that I belong

I wish I had made friends sooner, I don't have anyone now and I feel that I am just a burden. I wish I had gotten a job instead of letting myself be pressured into post secondary education, I have no money or direction now and I feel that I am a failure. I wish I had stood up for myself in bad relationships, I don't have any self respect now and I feel that I am a weak loser. I wish I had matured sooner, I am very far behind in life and I feel that I cannot catch up. I wish I had any confidence in myself, I am convinced that it is too late to make anything worthwhile because the foundations of my life are rotten and building on rotten foundation is recipe for disaster.

I wish I had a better family, a better community, a better world to live in, and I wish I was a better person. No matter what anyone says, I don't believe much can change.

I'm not like others, I wish I was. I can't use social media at all because it floors me to see others doing things I wanted to do, and seeing the results of the better choices they made.

I wish life were easier, people were kinder, mistakes could be undone, and I wish I didn't feel so down all the time. I've long since learned that it doesn't matter what I think or want; I have no power, influence, or real drive left to change",3
"Hi everyone. I'm really not even in the mood to do this, but I don't want to be alone now. I'm having a breakdown and considering suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

So today, my boss of a year told me she's relocating me. She said it's because of my body odor. She talked to me in January about it and I told her I'm doing my best. She told me today I was doing better but today it's been ""the worse it's been since then.""

I'm absolutely devastated. I have depression and schizophrenia, but I still brush my hair, brush my teeth, use deodorant, and body spray. I don't shower often because I have bad memories of when I was younger, I had severe eczema, and my skin would burn and peel when water touched it. I'm terrified of showers now. 

I know I have a responsibility to take care of myself, but it's so hard when I'm TRYING but no one seems to care that I'm trying. I also know my boss has been stressed lately, but I feel like she forgot what I told her in January and is snapping at me.

She also just sent me an email.

"" In January we had conversation about hygiene one that I had been reluctant to have. Â From that conversation I believed that you would rectify the situation. Over the the past few weeks hygiene has become an issue again.

I am not sure if I am able to assist you in figuring out how to go about resolving the problem. What I am sure of is that you are a great member of the team and I want you to continue to work in the office.""

I'm not even sure I want to be here anymore. I was feeling really good about myself today. I changed clothes, used deodorant and body spray, and brushed my hair for the first time in days. I'm also getting my first car tomorrow. I thought that I could have a week where I actually felt hopeful.

I know I'm overreacting, but I just feel horrible about myself. I called my dad crying and he told me it was my fault and that he isn't trying to ""hurt me"". I told him ""I shouldn't have even called anyone."" and hung up. 

I'm just really tired and considering overdosing when I clock out of work today. I have plenty of Zoloft, plenty of BuSpar, and one dose of hydrocodone. I just regret being here because I have my dog here with me on campus. I asked my dad to come and pick me up and he acted like I was asking him to move a mountain for me. Even though I pay for gas and food and bills. So I told him to wait until tomorrow, I just wouldn't go to work tomorrow.

I just really want to die because I feel so awful about myself. I feel like I'm not worthy of love. I feel like I'm not worthy of respect. I'm exhausted. I feel that it would be better if I was dead, so my boss wouldn't have to deal with me.",3
"Yesterday my mom took me to a disney event with free tickets (I'm 21) and said I could invite two friends. I invited two girls, 21 and 18 and they're really pretty. They both have boyfriends and even on the photos they posted of the 3 of us together some guys said that they were both hot, but conveniently left me out of that. I have anorexia and my mom took some pics of us all hanging out. Today she said ""look at those pictures. you look like a 12 year old with two babysitters. they're beautiful and look at you. i don't care if you have to deal with your sad thoughts and shit that sucks but you're an embarrassment to me and antisocial your friends seem to have more fun with each other than with you, you're antisocial i wouldn't wanna be your friend.""

I'm really at my wits end. I wish I could sleep the pain away, but it never stops. It will never stop.",1
"I feel like absolute shit, i've been very depressed and suicidal lately and now my boyfriend broke up with me too and i get it because of his mental health and mine but it hurts so much, we still love eachother but i am scared i will lose him, i always knew i would kill myself if he broke up with me (i know i am a dumbass) and now everything else is going downhill too, i can't do this anymore but i am too much of a coward to do it. I've been crying nonstop since he broke up and i can't eat anything because o hate my body and i've been so nauseous since he broke up. Everything reminds me of him and it hurts so much. It's not only about him tho, everything sucks, i can't get a job and i am a disappointment to everyone in my life. I really can't do it anymore. I don't even have my meda anymore even though i doubt they would help. I am really thinking about overdosing again but idk if it would work because the other times i tried it didn't work either. I just hate my life so much and no it doesn't t better eventually, i've been telling myself that forever but whenever it gets a bit better, it gets a lot worse immediately after. I just can't do it anymore

Edit: this is a throwaway account so the people i know on here don't know it's me

Edit 2: i just realised my life literally has no meaning anymore, i have no goals, i am unhappy, i have nothing i enjoy and i just wanna die, i am literally just staying alive for other people",4
"I was doing so good, the birds all sang in the morning, the aroma of the flowers; I had not been enticed by that smell in such a long time. I had managed to clean my room; got rid of the giant stack of clothes, the water bottle collection and opened up the curtains to let the sun radiate my small lumpy mattress. Lost 5 pounds in 2 weeks from eating right and hitting the gym. Went out of my way to interact with people, like I used to love. I was planning to make a cheesecake with my niece and make strawberry flowers. Then I realized how pointless all THIS is. I'm NEVER going to be happy. I guess that's just how it goes. Like a swing, bro. Now I'm here indecisive on whether to buy the poison that has released me from the shackles of existence countless other times or return to my prison cell and â€œface it like a manâ€. Either way there is no way out.",5
"Hi everyone, i don't know where to start but i am 23 and i am on my 6th year in college majoring engineering physics. I don't even want to go there. Since i was a kid i am in obsessed with computers and art, but my parents think that they have no future prospect whatsoever. And now i'm 6 year deep in college and failing here and there. My parents are disappointed and angry at me.

Today i skipped an exam because i just can't drag myself to the campus just to at least show up. It felt so horrible and i can't stand it. So i took any meds i have and start swallowing them. All this time i've been cutting but all i can manage is just shallow cuts and then bleed for a few minutes, so today i want to try a new method.

"And this time I cant really hide it. The last few times its happened I've been able to hide it from my friends beaches I only had two clase with them, but this year I have four. They've never really seen me slip into a depression before (in fact they didn't notice the first time when it was really, really bad) so they've come to the conclusion that I've started cutting again. They're not exactly wrong, but its not even ounce every two weeks, and not for the reasons they think (bullying/ people being less than kind). They really don't know as much about my mental state as they think they do. Should I do something? Is there anything I can do without freaking them out with my suicidal tendencies?",3
"I knew that wouldn't last long. Ok story time. You last heard from me saying I'm leaving the sub, now I have a crippling addiction to self harm and want to die because of it. Needless to say I did something wrong. 
I'll explain, I was enjoying some YouTube when I saw â€œBeautiful?â€ by illymations. It was a very triggering song for me and I sniped my skin after a year long clean streak ( if you're confused because I've been gone for four months I didn't cut in that time) and gained a handy dandy addiction. I used anything I could get my hands on, then one day my dog was biting me really hard and I went on the floor crying thinking about how everyone hates me even my dog. Then I really wanted to die every day. I have the same schedule every day, wake up and snooze till I make my lunch, I never eat breakfast, switch t-shirts, bike to school and say hi to the crossing guard, go to each class feeling like garbage and cutting in pe and English, biking home feeling like a failure, eating and being apathetic, doing my homework till I pass out (so like two pages in) waking up and doing more homework then going to bed at 2 then waking up and doing it all again.

"at first I was mad, wondering how could he think that his life was worthless enough to choose to kill himself. I mean, I'm depressed too. I know what it means. But he actually did it. He killed himself. He's dead. I have him between my friends on steam and I see the ""last logged in"" day always getting more far. First two days, then a week, two weeks, four weeks. He's never going to log in again, because he's dead. I wonder if he did the right thing. Life is fucking hard. I should get a job. I should go back to school. I should get a license. I don't want to.

"Hi, I'm an eighth grader at a magnet school. I have ADD (attention deficit disorder), symptoms of depression, and I'm suicidal. For the past 3 years I've slowly been less and less motivated to do anything, even what I enjoy. I just want to go to sleep forever and forget about all the stress of school and a difficult social life. I get very stressed over school as the stakes go up, and my mom is constantly reminding me that I'll be a failure if I get too many B's. It doesn't help that my friends began ignoring me more and more when we started middle school with new, better people to hang out with than me. I'm treated like a tag-along now. My former best friends only talk to me and listen when they're bored and nobody else is there to talk to. I started having thoughts of suicide near the end of seventh grade, but it's really gotten worse this year as more is expected of me and my friends cast me further away. 
I decided to finally talk to someone this year, since my previous hints of needing help went unnoticed by my mom. On a day where I felt very low mentally, I told my mom I was suicidal. I broke down crying, and she hugged me. However, she said, ""Don't EVER even think about killing yourself. Do you know what that would do to me?"" I was a little upset about her reaction, as she seemed more concerned about herself. But I kept telling her more. I told her about how I thought I had depression, and she dismissed it as ""stress"" and said it would stop if i started to be positive. I was taken aback by this. I love my mother a lot, but she's never been good at giving advice or helping with my mental health. I got mad at her and began yelling about her never understanding or helping with my feelings. I was a little too extreme, but the anger was not irrational. She yelled back something about her trying to help with the grief counselor (1. She didn't help very much. 2. She was there to help us deal with grief over a family death, and she didn't help with my suicidalness). What made me feel worthless was when she yelled, ""What do you want me to do about it?"" and told her I wanted her there for me to talk to and she went on about my grades, what have I told you, learn to deal with your emotions better, etc. I ran off crying to continue my homework. A few minutes later she came in with her phone and my dad was on a call. She had told him. She was mad about me not focusing on my homework and I needed to hurry it up and finish and stop crying. I kept crying, upset she didn't help, and a few minutes later my dad arrives. He was upset that I wasn't working on the project and ""wasting time"". I kept crying until he started yelling to stop crying. I stopped, tears welling in my eyes. I love my dad too, but he can't control his anger very well, and he follows his parent's ways of discipline, which is what he grew up with. As he lectured me I started clawing my arm to calm myself like I always do. He noticed me leaving scars on my arm and got angrier. He told me to stop and said this: ""Do you want me to do it for you?"" This really upset me, but I said nothing to avoid an argument. He got me to finish the project. He said he cared about me and loved me, and he left. No discussion of my mental state. My mom called him when i started crying later and he wasn't mad this time. He told me to go to sleep and feel better. I didn't feel better when I slept.
I just needed to get all that out.... I've been considering suicide a lot, and I know there's ""help everywhere"" like hotlines and such, but it won't help. I need people I care about to talk to. I lost my grandma in December of 2018 to cancer. She listened and cared. I have no one I know of now. My friends don't listen, and I feel like they think I talk about sad stuff too much. I just need to know what to do, because I honestly don't know anymore. The people I care about most can't help me, and I feel worthless. I never know what to talk about, and when i get to talk for once, my friends look at me different than they do at other friends. They look lost, bored, and like they want me to hurry up and get it over with. Then they go back to talking to the other people. I just need some advice... if you read this whole vent then you are an amazing person and I hope you have a wonderful day.",2
"&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... 

&amp;#x200B;

Letter to my depressed lover.

I see you. I know you're in there. The man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt

deserving of happiness. He is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless

basement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. At times it feels like there is no hope, at

times it feels like there is no escape. You are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your

body, your mind and your soul, you question whether you'll ever be strong enough to fight

this mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. Will you ever be able to feel

the sun stroking your skin again? Will you ever see the light again? Will you ever feel love

again?

Why are you here? How did you get here? You never asked for this, no one would.

A tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression. Tyranny is not fair, it is not

understanding, and it is cruel. The tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but

to succumb, he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no

longer a threat to him. The tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too

mighty to outthink, too present to escape.

But let me tell you something about Tyrants. Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.

Behind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a

heart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn't want you to

see the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn't want you to know love,

because love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.

But how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves

the way for another form of tyranny. You don't want to kill your tyrant, you'll be left with

blood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you'll have to hide, and what is the

point of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of

darkness?

No. Your tyrant won't be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that

your love is strong enough to turn him around.

The man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the

sight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is

surprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The

man that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around

him feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you

never knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone's day. The man that I

love will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and

attention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that

he can make anyone's darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,

it will be the man that I love.

Love can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,

comfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,

with a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your

&amp;#x200B;

tyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all

along he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were

never your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that

realisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are

facing yourself. But don't worry, it's just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he

won't wish to do that anymore though, he'll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will

realise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your

tyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who

doesn't believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man

who can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.

So you will take the child's hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who's

to say that you won't hurt him? But you will give him your word, you will promise him that

he is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you will know that you are telling the truth. The

child will weep in your arms, and you will hold him tighter, you will tell him that he is loved,

he is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he will never be alone.

You will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. And although at first it will

feel like a relief, it won't be easy. You haven't seen the sun in so long, its light will feel

blinding and uncomfortable, your body will still feel weak, and as you'll barely feel able to

look after yourself, you'll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? But

you will surprise yourself. Through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the

cool grass underneath your feet, you will find strength. Enough strength to lift yourself up,

carry the child, and start walking. It will be challenging, and you'll worry that each step

might be your last step, you'll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get

back up, but you'll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural.

Eventually you'll look up and realise that the sun isn't as blinding as it was when you first

came out, you'll see a path, and you'll know how to get home.

On your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a

burden for me. What if I don't want him? What if I don't love him? After all he was once a

tyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don't even love you anymore? You've been gone

for so long, what if I've stopped waiting? What if I've given up? What if I've found someone

else? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you've both already been

hurt?

But all this time, I've been waiting for you. I've been worrying, I've been crying, you

disappeared so suddenly I never understood what had happened. I made it my mission to

find you, I was up day and night trying to save you, I called on you a thousand times, I

searched for clues in every corner, I even tried to negotiate with your tyrant, but to no avail,

it only angered him more. I tried to get help, but no one could help me, and in the end, I was

left weakened. That's when I realised that I was exhausting myself, and I wasn't helping you.

So I did the only thing I could do. I stopped trying to save you and trusted that you would be

able to save yourself, and as I waited for you to do that, I held our space, I nourished our

space so that you could come back to a loving and nurturing home, one where you could

one day feel whole again and heal.

&amp;#x200B;

When you come home, I will welcome your little boy with open arms, and love him, just as I

learned to love the little girl who once held me hostage in a basement. The truth is I already

know your little boy, I've seen him in your shadows, and I've already grown to love him. You

also know my little girl, she has been living in our home throughout our entire relationship.

She has loved you as much as I have, and although at first she was afraid of you, she was

afraid that you would hurt her, she grew to love you, and she learned to trust you. When

you were gone for so long, she began to worry, she worried that perhaps you would never

come back, she worried that perhaps you didn't want to come back to us, perhaps you

wanted another home, a different home, perhaps you had stopped loving us.

But I reassured her, and I told her about the love that we shared, the hours and days we

spent looking into each other's eyes, as time stood still and the world around us vanished,

and we questioned, every day, how we could be so lucky. Our love is the truest love I've

ever known, our love is the deepest love I've ever known, and I know that a love like ours,

never just goes away.

One day my little girl will meet your little boy, and they will love each other as much as we

love each other, the four of us will build a home so whole, that all our fears will be replaced

by trust, our anger will be replaced by love, and tyranny will be nothing but a distant

memory.

This isn't going to happen overnight, we don't want you to exhaust yourself trying to come

home, we don't want you to run and fall, we want you to make wise and calculated steps, so

that you can slowly but surely come back to us.

If I could, I would be in the basement with you, but you don't want me there, and if I force

myself into the basement, my little girl will turn into a tyrant again and our home will

collapse. So although I'm not in the darkness with you, know that I can still see you, and I

am still here, holding our fort, waiting for you to find the strength to love your tyrant

unconditionally, so that you can bring him home for us to nurture and heal him, so that he

can learn to fearlessly trust both of us.",0
"So these past few months my mental health has been getting worse and I don't know if it's because of these two friends I have, because I don't want to put all the blame on them. So I met one of them at the beginning of the school year and the other one I've known for a while but we never really talked and they were really nice to me and we had lots of fun hanging out after school since we were on the same bus. But as time went on they kinda got mean? One of them would sometimes slap me or punch me in the stomach but when I would stand up for myself they would be like I'm over reacting or something. The other one just confuses me since one day she would be praising me saying â€œyou're so smartâ€ â€œ how are you so good at everythingâ€ then the next day she'll be like â€œ you're so fucking dumb you're and idiotâ€ â€œaren't you smart so like you're supposed to know thatâ€ â€œdon't you even know fucking anythingâ€ just to make it clear I never really liked having those types of compliments since it made me uncomfortable since it's like what if I all of a sudden don't meet their expectations or something. I feel like my â€œproblemâ€ is just me overreacting but I've been trying to distance myself but on the bus while they're next to me I can hear them talking shit about me. I keep to myself around them I don't talk to them but they still talk to me asking why are you ignoring us. Again I'm probably just overreacting but I just need advice on what I should do since I've been getting more anxious and what they say about me gets to my head sometimes. (Sorry I'm not really good on explaining things so if this get confusing sorry) :(",1

"I have been clinically depressed for 3 years. Actually, it's just been pushing through and demanding solitude because I've run out of people to talk to. 

I have heart disease but Ihave slowly been losing weight and eating better. My doctor asked me the routine questions:

â€œWhat degree are you graduating with?â€

â€œIs there good money in that? Enough to buy a home?â€ 

Then she says 

â€œIt doesn't matter what degree you get, if you become an engineer, or how much money you plan on getting. You'll be dead so early that you won't be able to even attempt to achieve or enjoy any of itâ€

I'm starting to think I don't have depression and I'm just a bitch and I don't know how to tell if that's the case. The weirdest thing is, over the last month I've been increasingly feeling well. My life is shit becausd I missed lits of school and so I worry a lot, but that's normal. Other than that I feel.. fine. I don't feel depressed. Could it be that this is temporary or does this mean I don't have depression. The other thing is I was given pills but the thing is I don't want to take pills that might fuck me if I'm feeling ok atm. Advice?????? I need to make some decisions fast",3
"8 months ago, the love of my life left me. I put everything I had into salvaging the relationship, but in the end even offering to uproot my whole life for her, it wasn't enough. I sunk really low, but I had a friend who helped me through it and did everything in his power to help me out. I went to theropy for a bit but found it far more stressful than useful, so I turned to self help books. I started to think more positively, have a bit, more confidence in my self, and felt like I genuinely self improved. That countied until a few days ago. I got rejected by someone I really cared about, and it didn't go well.

After farther reflection, I haven't made progress on any of the goals I set to fix myself, even though I put in all my effort. My little confidence I gained is shattered. For the last few days, I have though about sueicde a lot, to the point where I don't go into work anymore because there is no point. That friend I had has moved up in life, to the point where I feel if I reach out to him I will just be a burden anyways. I am not close to my family at all, and if they knew I was depressed they would tell me to suck it up. I don't believe in religion, it's likely we live in a computer simulation so nothing will matter if I go. I am going to die alone, so why wait for it to happen naturally?",4
"Hi. I have had a bit of a rough day and honestly it feels like my thoughts are actually killing me. So I really feel like I need to express my feelings right now.
So my thoughts are just gonna be thrown out there so without further ado....
I think I suck. At everything...my job, having friends, just...everything really. It honestly feels like I cannot just work like a human being.

Now don't get me wrong, i don't hate life. I have things I rather love about life such as my family and my job including the people I work with.

And everyone keeps telling me how ""nice"" and ""good"" I am at my job such as winning a rather ""employee of the month"" sorta thing but as strange as this seems....

I struggle to believe them. Now of course I'm not calling them liars I just find it to hard to believe. I know that sounds rather stupid but I honestly just can't help feel this way.

As I said I truly love my job and everyone there but that is honestly where most of my self esteem comes from so constantly thinking I'm horrible at it is obviously not a good cycle.

Now as for everything else apart from my job, well I will just break it down like this:
I'm at overweight, ugly, shy, embarssing and awkward guy that honestly anyone could cringe at talking to. And of course I'm trying to overcome some of these things like the overweight part but...I'm honestly losing hope at this point and it's giving thoughts of doing something silly to my self.

Sorry about this silly dump of self pity but I actually couldn't think of what else to do.

Thanks for reading and have a good rest day.",1
"i'm just so tired. it feels like the only rational decision at this point. im never ever going to feel relief. i'm stupid, i'm unreliable, i'm trapped. i feel so trapped all the time. life is just a cage. i want to sleep. i think i'll finish up writing notes and go to bed. hell, if everyone's asleep by then i'll just pour myself a cup of bleach and i'll be dead in the morning. i just hope everything's over soon",5
"I can't fcking take this any longer, this post probably won't help me much but I'm so desperate that I'll try anything to have a glimpse of hope. I'm so confused that I can't even write a proper text begging for help, a very simple act can become so complex and overwhelming to me. 
I'll try to write this as coherent as possible but since english isn't my main language and I seem to have lost all my intelligence, so please forgive me if It starts getting confusing.

So basically, I have no idea what to do, my depression is getting so bad that I don't see any other way out besides ending it all. I feel no pleasure what so ever, not even masturbating gives me any pleasure. I feel like shit on a daily basis, from overwhelming sadness, anxiety and rage to paranoia, overwhelming suicidal thoughts and even homicidal thoughts. I don't want to hurt anyone besides myself thought. I'm such a failure, I'm 18 and still a virgin, I'm fat and all the freaking times I joined the gym I found myself just giving up weeks later. I have no social skills, or better yet no skills AT ALL. All my life I was illuded by my teachers, parents and friends into thinking that I was smarter than average, and the worst thing is that was the only good thing I saw on me, but I'm not smart at all, I'm just a dumb piece of shit. I tried everything I could to treat my depression but nothing seems to work, meditation (minimum of 30 minutes per day), medication (multiple antipsychotics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines), psychedelic drugs (LSD, magic mushrooms, DMT, you name it I probably tried it). I go to a psychologist and psychiatrist but I feel no better, probably worse than when it all started, the worst part is that I don't even remember when and how it started. Now I wouldn't say I bias drugs that much, I mainly smoke a bit of weed every now and then, mostly weekends, and regarding psychedelics I done them rarely and with every bit of damage reduction I could think of, perhaps I did indeed disrespect them a bit (mostly taking them without prior planning leading to uncomfortable sets and settings) since I can't enjoy them anymore, I panic and my mind instantly tells me to take xanax or any benzo I can get my hands on. However I DID bias Xanax, so much so that I ended up on the hospital a couple times for taking too much of it and blacking out, while in school which just fucked my reputation in school. My friends tried to help me as much as they could, but my mind is so fucked and confused that nothing seems to help. This text is getting long but I still have so much to say, I'll try to not make it too long so you don't get bored quickly. My grades are down the hill, I'm currently in 12th grade and about to fail, and honestly I CAN'T stand another year at that school, I rather hang myself than go through that again, specially since I live in an isolated island in the middle of nowhere and resources are very limited here, there's nothing to do here and there's no chance I'm getting a girlfriend here (or anywhere to be honest, nobody would love a fat piece of shit like me).

Life is unbearable, I see no reason to stay alive, all I do all day is playing fcking LoL and let me tell you I hate that game so much, makes my blood boil and gives me urges to just cut my wrists. I can't make basic math/physics/chemistry/etc.. which just makes me feel even worst, cuz I need it to get to college, but I don't understand shit in school, since I can't study or focus, my mind just bombards me with horrible thoughts that echo in my mind till I put myself to sleep, I have no control over my mind anymore. I started learning guitar, and ended up giving up. I tried to learn how to program, but It's too overwhelming and I'm starting to lose any motivation I had for it (not that I had much motivation in general).

Here's some backstory, when I was a kid I got shot in my eye with a air pressure carabine, which left me with about 10% vision on said eye, made me get fat cuz I couldn't do exercise for about 2-3 years and I ended up getting a bad lifestyle in general, all day in computer playing games. This combined with more trauma I went throught and my midly toxic family, lead to me becoming the disgusting person I could think of. I know this is getting too much information and confusing please forgive me, I'm retarded.

Right now all I can think of is how to kill myself, I've tried it before with pills but ended up failing, so this time I'm thinking of hanging myself, and will do it eventually.

Just thinking of all this makes my blood boil, I Hate life so much, I hate my fucking family, I hate my fucking school, I hate myself, I wanna shoot myself in the head and end it all.",5
"Previously I posted in r/Assistance that I got out of debt reselling stuff... Everything was going very well until I wanted to make an order for things I already got paid for. Accidentally deposited to a phishing site that looked and acted exactly like the original one. Now instead of being 2000 USD in debt, I'm in 12000 USD debt.

"hey there everybody,

you know when you can't get out of bed for days at a time, well what's your favourite thing to do while stuck in bed?

i like to sleep. it's weird but when i'm depressed i don't listen to music much. except music that makes me feel nostalgic, occasionally. normally when my depression shifts into a more passive state i listen to lots of music. lots of youtube but that's not terribly stimulating though",5
"I'm in kind of a hole. Almost 4 months of no work now. All i do is get high. I don't go out with friends anymore. I don't leave the house anymore, only to buy weed. I've gotten kind of anxious of people. And very very bitter in general. 

Does anyone relate? Do you have any tips of how to get out of this? 

I'm in therapy. And i promise myself every night that tomorrow will be different, but that usually only lasts like a day or two and then I go back into bed.",3
It used to be something I did once every couple weeks at a party when I was a teen. Now it makes me happy. I love waking up still hungover with brain fog. It gives me this fuzzy feeling I used to feel with my SO. I know it's terrible for me. I still work out but that only gives me an hour high. I've realized if I'm sober my thoughts consume me and when I'm drunk everything's ok. My family and friends wonder how I do it but I guess I like the depressing hungover feeling.,3

"Is it bad that I kind of want to just catch the virus already? I have a lot of health conditions and if I die from the virus, oh well it was tragic. Just get it over with. My odds of getting it are pretty high anyway, seeing that I live in the epicenter of the US outbreak and have to go out in public for work. 

I'm already a burden to everyone around me. I'm an inconvenience and my pain is over dramatic. I don't have the right to complain and don't want to annoy those around me by saying anything or accidentally letting on that something is up. The way I feel is disproportionate to the severity of my problems and I should be over it. Dying by COVID-19 would solve that, honestly. I don't really want to die, especially not from suffocation and pneumonia, but it feels inevitable right now.

Sorry for the rant. If you read to the end, have a good night and wash your hands. Maybe it'll end this thing sooner.",3

"The reason I drink is to self medicate because I saw my friend pass away in a car accident when I was 19. We were both stupid and I challenged him to a race using our parents cars. Basically, he understeered into a tree. I have tried therapy but it didn't work for me. I was also diagnosed with PTSD and depression. I stopped taking my prescription because it didn't work for me. I feel that I have blood on my hands because I was the one who made him do it. 

My parents and grandfather came to me and told me that they were worried about my drinking problem. I sometimes drink a bottle of Vodka a day. I just want to drink myself to death because I'm too scared of killing myself. My granddad tried to relate to the situation by telling me about the things he was in Vietnam. I walked out because I was upset about everything. I now think that I was out of order and I would do anything to apologise. But at the same time, I feel that they shouldn't have bought my grandfather along because he is getting Parkinsons disease so I don't want him to worry about me as well.",4
"hi. I'm not sure if this is one of those things where if you have to ask it then there is a definite answer, but I'm not sure if what I experience is truly suicidal thoughts.

when I don't feel sad I become very thankful and when I try to express to God thanks for what he has given me, I feel guilty for spending my time self harming or being self destructive. I feel I'll never be able to truly convey how thankful I am for what he's given me and I'm back to square one, just wishing I was never born so I wouldn't have these thoughts and emotions.

I don't really care about anything and many of my thoughts are just wishing I could disappear or wishing I was ""less"" in every possible way. I want to not be alive so I don't feel the emotions I feel. I do not often contemplate different ways to kill myself, it is moreso just wishing I wasn't born in the first place or hoping someday something else will happen to me that makes this decision for me.

the majority of my thoughts are wishing I was dead or never born, and even when I'm happy I just wish I could stop feeling and the answer to that to me is death. is the way I'm feeling considered suicidal?

thank you for reading. any comment will be appreciated and answered.",5
"Another thing. My mom recommended I consider a grief therapy group or just a normal therapy group. I don't think I'm still grieving but I might be. I was in a process group many times, but I only sometimes felt okay with it.

Some of the others had an idea of what I deal with, as far as crippling depression and at the time, a bad home life. But they didn't have DID or BPD. At this point it's either one ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸. And the therapists, it didn't seem like they really knew how to help, like maybe they have had a personality case before but not on my level. 

I'm actually considering getting back into a group. Who knows, maybe this time they can actually help. I'm trying to not be so closed off. That's how it gets worse. Start shifting personalities and when I interact with my mom or anyone calling me, it's me but not me. Hope that makes sense. 

Hope you guys are having a comfortable day, sending good vibes your way.",3
"Hi, 

First post on this sub in a while but I'm at a loss of what to do

I'm so fed up of feeling numb and tired and like I don't want to exist and my brain is so fogged that I cant think straight

I'm trying everything - taking the pills, doing the therapy, seeking advice and just nothing seems to be helping

I don't like my job, but I also don't want to resign without anything else lined up and all of the experts and forums and advice systems just suggest trying to 'think in a more positive manner' and I'm really trying but it just feels hopeless, I get 5 minutes of 'maybe this will be OK!' then immediately back to the grey reality

I've started applying for new jobs as my current manager has suggested that we get through year end then if I'm still feeling the same way then perhaps I should look elsewhere

so I kind of don't see the point in actually trying until year end as if I'm not staying then who am I impressing?

I have a 1:1 later so I guess I'll find out if it's time to leave

&amp;#x200B;

has anyone had this ? can anyone help?

sorry just a brain dump

cheers",2
"The reasons why:
- Severe depression. No cure and never getting better.
- 30 year old virgin. Still don't know how to make friends or talk to girls.
- Not able to focus myself and get into the field I want...so stuck at crappy jobs.
- About to be fired from crappy job #9 for being late too much. (Late almost every day cause I can't sleep nd can't get myself out of bed in the morning)
- Massive debt due to school loans, car repairs, and me being stupid.
- Bank account at $-111. Could have afforded the make the account positive today if the bank would waive the fees one more day. But they won't so I can't.

"When I was in the 10th grade I started to lose my memory and developed painful symptoms in my limbs, I immediately knew it was extremely serious and possibly terminal. Every few months I would get more sick and it has remained that way for the past 6 years I have been getting worse every few months.

My disease has become so severe that I cannot continue school or study from cognitive impairment, I can barely eat anything without getting pain and it is impossible to gain any weight.I can barely walk outside because of shortness of breath, I cannot leave the house in the summer.the disease is extremely painful and disabling every day is a battle with pain, and controlling symptoms.

several doctors have diagnosed me with a neurological disease which they say is untreatable and not curable.

so for the past few weeks I have been visiting gun shops while I lie to my parents and tell them I am going to the gym.

everyone treats me like crap especially my parents.

my body has reached its physical limits, I cannot endure any more pain from the disease it is impossible, so I am going to buy guns and kill myself.",3

I eat so much because food is the one of the few things that make me happy anymore.

I have been working for this company for almost four years and I know what I am doing. Then when I answered him he went and followed up with the other person to make sure I was telling the truth. I have never been dishonest with anyone at work so that really pissed me off and hurt my feelings. I am so tired of not being trusted. I once got accused of stealing $5k at a credit union I worked at long ago. I was never charged because I didn't do it and they couldn't prove it. I didn't do it and I don't know if they ever found out who did but it caused me a lot of hurt and grief. It is one of the worst feelings having everyone think you are something, like a theif, when you are far from it. I am still trying to lose that 50 pounds I gained from that bout of depression. I think my managers bullshit today stirred that shit up.

"we dated for a year. i broke up with her because we were arguing all the time and she was always getting mad at me. alas, i could've been better about not making her mad but anyways, it happened. she tried to reach out the first two weeks after it happened but i felt that we needed time to mature if we wanted to get back together. i still loved her and wanted to be with her, but i felt we needed time. about a month later, i got back in contact and she had started to try to move on. had done stuff with another guy. i fought. and fought. and fought. and fought. things started to pick up. we were hanging out again. it felt like we were back together. i kept fighting. kept fighting. kept fighting. kept fighting. till about 3 months later when she said she didn't feel the same anymore. and she'd done stuff with 3 other guys. granted, she's single and she can do what she wants. i just wish she would've told me sooner. she said she'll always have some sort of feelings for me and that i was the first person she loved. all of this to say, i still am so in love with her and want to spend the rest of my life with her. i really do. i don't want to live without her. for the first time since i was bullied in middle school (i'm in college now), i'm having genuine suicidal thoughts again. i don't want to live without her. i can't stand the thought of not being with her. and her being with someone else. i want that to be me. i want her to love me again and see that i can be the man she wants and needs. i don't know what to do with myself. i've hardly been eating these past few days and just genuinely haven't been hungry. if i don't work during the week (i work a part time job landscaping and we work if the weather permits, lately it has not) i just lay in bed and sulk and sleep. that's all. i don't know what to do with myself and i don't want to live without her. she's moved on and likes someone else now and they spend time together. and i can't take it. i don't know what to do.",4
"Everyday I feel better I feel the pain flood back into my heart. I'm stuck in a terrible spot, I hate my family and now that they know I have depression (friend forced me to tell a teacher) they treat me like I'm weak. I hate it, I know I suck but I'm strong enough to not take my life yet so just stop talking to me, please. I'm in love with my best friend and that could not be going worse and I want to cut my wrists, slit my throat and just bleed out soon. I would throw myself off a building but I want to do it soon. I just I can't take it. Every moment I'm not good enough for him and someone else is in his arms I want to do it more. I hate myself more everyday.",4

I'm on meds, trileptal, sertraline, lorazepam. I haven't been to my therapist in a while because I don't really want to talk about it. I think about flipping my car on the highway a lot.

I just keep thinking about how long i have left in life and I am already exhausted I'm only 24 and I'm tired of living , i don't have a big problem but i keep overthinking how exhausting living is and how many years i have to live i for some reason don't accept living, I'm sure it's just thoughts that comes out of bordem but I want to know if you can relate.",5
"I tried it last week, it didn't work AT ALL. Media is a scam. I think for it to work it's gotta be super deep and you gotta bleed for a long while before anything starts to happen.

... My ideal has always been carbon monoxide, but idk how to make that work. Isn't it dangerous (lol) if the house catches on fire if I'm just burning firewood or something in a bucket in a carpeted room? (recommendations?)

But in the process of thinking I was going to die, I did not regret anything at all and even felt peaceful for the first time in a long while. I think it's a good choice for me personally so I need to figure out the CO plan. However, I cut my wrist on a whim and know rationally that I am young and have family and people who I know will be disappointed/devasted if I take my life, so I need to wait until I'm older so that, to put it morbidly, at least my immediate family dies of natural causes first. But it's still very saddening to live, especially knowing death comes so easily (despite my strong survival instincts).

***What do you like about living?***

I'm looking for little things such as ""some beds are very comfortable,"" because ""things will get better"" is the stupidest BS I never want to hear again. Therapy/social workers are also just normal people anyways so don't tell me there's help either. Or share a funny joke. I once called crisis line for a funny joke the lady was like ""wat? wat? do you want to tell me ur problems?""

Hell no. If I talk about my problems I'll just be reminded of them again and get even sadder than I originally needed to me. It makes the problems seem worse than they are.",2
"I'm trying to understand what's going on with my current SO, I don't fully understand depression nor do I understand self harm. 
I spent 4 years with my ex who was severely depressed and had suicidal tendencies at his worst points. I tried so hard to be there for him but I eventually gave up when he forced me to leave him because he knew I would be better off without him. 

Now I'm with my current boyfriend, who has been amazing and my rock, but he just revealed that his cuts are actually his own doing. I've only seen it twice. He's a normal happy guy with some family troubles, sometimes financial but he handles things rather well and optimistically. It's hard to gauge him at times because he's generally a happy guy but he breaks down easily when things start to pile on, understandably so. He is nowhere near how I would describe someone who is depressed, but now I'm not so sure because of the SH. 
Can someone help me understand what he might be going through? Should I be worrying for his life? I'm heartbroken because I hate seeing this pain he's going through. I thought it was something I wouldn't have to go through again, it was hard going through it in the past. I feel selfish for feeling like this, I feel almost upset that this is happening. Not at him, but at the situation. 
I don't know how to go about this at all, I'm just trying to see how I could help him.",4
"Literally everything is falling apart. I don't know how much more I can take, or want to. I understand that pain makes you stronger but at this point I'm just numb, and I'm not learning from these setbacks.

"TLDR: only I can make myself happy again and I know for a fact I'll never do that, I'm hopeless

â€”â€”â€”

I'm only making myself feel worse because I have so many things to do and I'm not doing any of them because I'm lazy and want to lie in bed all day. Then the stress of it all just builds up and the stress paralyzes me into inaction even more and then more stress piles up and so on

I'm digging myself a hole, I'm making myself worse off and ruining my own life

And at the end of the day it's up to me to fix myself. It's up to me to get things done and to get my life in order, to make myself happy again

But I know for a fact I can't do that. I'm too lazy, too tired, can't focus on anything or anyone other than myself. I'm pathetic 

I'll never be able to find the will to fix myself so why am I even still here? Just to stay miserable until I inevitably kill myself down the road because I'm incapable of helping myself

Nothing will ever be able to fix me. It's all up to me. It's up to me and that's scary because I'll never be able to help myself. I can't, I know for a fact I can't and I won't 

I'm wasting so many peoples time by reaching out because I don't believe a single kind word they say and don't follow any of their advice because I'm too lazy to try

"(I'm not a native english speaker, sorry for all the grammatical errors) 

I feel like I'm a fucking idiot and that the only reason I succeeded at school was because I was working hard, until now. I'm in my first year of college and the second semester started about a month ago but I feel like everything is falling appart. Two teachers barked at me while strongly implying that I was fucking dumb, I studied for several hours for a test and I ended up failing miserably while most of the class (who didn't study at all) found the test super easy. The worse thing is that the place I'm studying at wasn't even the one my high school teachers recommended me to go, thinking it was ""too easy"" for me, but I went to study here anyway because I felt like I wouldn't psychologically handle the option my high school teachers were recommending me to go to (in fact the day before my math finals in hs I was paralyzed on my bed for more than 30min and couldn't stop cyring thinking I wouldn't pass it despite the days I spent studying it). So currently I feel like that I'm just a dumb idiot and that everyone else is simply smarter than me, and the sole reason as to why I succeeded until now was because I cared about my grades but many didn't. I don't know what to do, I don't even know if I even deserve to post something here, I find myself ridiculous and I'm starting to skip meals.",2
"told my mum this morning that i can't do this anymore when she saw me in hysterical tears before school. i explained that i'm not getting the help i need and i have suicidal thoughts all the time. she said she knows i've been through so much shit but i'm doing so well and i'm entitled to feel sad &amp; like i need a break. 

i'm not coping. it's like everything is going too fast for me and i need time. i've been mentally ill most of my life and i've only been here a little less than 15 years. i've only had one depression break from school once before and that was because i took sleeping pills the night before and couldn't wake up. my mum just thought i was super tired so i was â€œoff sickâ€. I've still never told anyone about that, i was hoping to fall asleep and never wake up. 

I feel like a burden to people so i find it hard to ask for support. that's why i often resort to cries for help. i feel trapped in my own mind. life is exhausting and i can't control my emotions. I want to be happy but my own fucking brain gets in the way of everything.",5
"And I really want to help him somehow but I just don't know how. I don't understand how he feels to be honest, since we are just so different I guess, but I try. What should I do?

It's been almost a year since I was put on antidepressants and nothings changed. They've tried different meds and different doses but it doesn't work.

I've been diagnosed with PTSD recently and they tell me that my depression is from the PTSD but Jesus I feel like I'm just another mark on the books of a fucked up people.

Regardless of the verdict, I will have made my disgusting and horrible actions known to the public so history cannot repeat itself, and little girls will be safe from the predator who stole so much from me.

It's difficult accepting and understanding what's happened in the past has effectively shaped you in a negative and positive way. But most of us stop there. I'm stopped there. The negative way, it's so easy to get caught in that loop. We can be right about some things but it doesn't change anything. I say I can't believe I've gotten this bad for good.

"So last week everything got to me.

I've lost my son, wife, car, my home even and haven't eaten in 5 days as I have nothing to my name. Living off nothing but tap water for substance. I'm week and ill due to this.

My parents won't help, they say I'm a wimp for attempting.

My father said I was worthless and amount to nothing before offering to kick my face in for being a ""puff"" (rich as he's never worked in my entire life a day and mum's always provided for him while I've worked abroad, owned a home and much more but yeah).

My friends avoid me and don't want to hang around me, o only have a place to sleep thanks to my mother, but it's a rock hard floor and my father won't let me stay, eat or do anything there so in the day I'm cut lose to wonder the streets in the rain and cold. A problem as we've had a lot of major storms and even flooding here recently.

So last week I went to the lake I frequented as a child and hung myself. That was meant to be it. But in typical pathetic fashion I failed here too. The rope snapped.

I woke up a few minutes later, dizzy from the fall, unsure where I was due to the lack of oxygen. Eventually I recovered and went back to my parents to sleep. Wet, drenched, in pain and hungry. The next morning the bias from my father began.

I'm 24 and I have nothing, only a few months ago I had everything and a newborn son. My ex wife took all that, took him thousands of miles away. I miss him more than anything.

But nobody cares I'm hungry, cold, alone. Nobody even cares I attempted suicide.

Not a single friend wants to spend time with me. My family hates me. My son isn't there to comfort me.

All I can take pride in now is my ability to end everything again soon, to finally have this all over, and this time I won't fail hopefully.",4
"I don't really know what im expecting of righting this but at this point i'm willing to do anything to stop this unbearable pain of existing.

I'm gonna give you a brief overview over my entire life and what exactly it is right now that lead me to the decision that my life is not worth living anymore.

Elementary School was hell. Had a teacher that sat me behind a bookshelf from which i wasnt even able to see the blackboard or participate in class because i was ""distracing"" the other children. The teacher videotaped me ""misbehaving"" in class to ridicule my parents and parentsmeetings. I was a smart kid. I was able to write and do basic math before i went to school. I was bored. When i was finished with my stuff I walked through the room and helped the children that were struggling. I dont see any misbehaving in that but maybe im wrong. Final report card was straight A's. Teacher still recommended that i go to a school for idiots. In my country this recommendation is on the report card. When i applied at ""normal"" schools not a single one wanted to teach me because of that recommendation which was just straigh up bullshit. In the end i found a school that saw my potential and didnt care about the recommendation. So i was able to get a decent education.

While all of that was happening home was hell. My dad was violent and abusive and my mother never intervened when he punched me in the face etc. i dont know if she did not care or if she was afraid. it doesnt matter to me. I felt and still feel abandoned. 

From age 9-12 my older brother was raping me over and over. Not like once a month or something. EVERY SINGLE DAY. sometimes even multiple times. But who should i have asked for help? my father that is violent me? my mother that doesnt do shit? He even invited his friends to watch and spit on me.

With 14 i had the realization that i wasnt normal anymore. I wasnt talking alot. I stopped enjoying literally anything. Thats also when i started to cut myself.

Fast forward to me being 19. I finished school. Got my highschool diploma eventhough i was suffering from severe depression as i found out later. I also had 1 friend. Lets call her L. I got a job over 100 miles away from my parents. I moved out. Lived there in terrible conditions since i made almost no money. But i think i felt better. Im not sure since i was stoned most of the time. After 3 years living away from my parents L tried to commit suicide. I blame myself but i dont want to get into detail of why that is. She survived. I was there for her. I took all my years vacation to be there for her. 

6 Months later i live with my parents again since i was breaking down and wasnt able to take care of myself anymore. i admit myself to a mental hospital because i was highly suicidal and L urged me to do it. After i admitted myself L blocked me on all social media up to this day. This was 3 years ago. I stayed 3 months in the hospital and learned alot. I learned that i suffer from depression, paranoia, narcissm, have borderline personality disorder and have symptoms that might be a psychosis but no one can confirm or deny this. I was talking about all the stuff that happened to me. But i learned nothing to cope with that stuff. Or accept it. Or stop thinking about it constantly. 

Basically i was worse than before. Everything was fresh in my mind. But no one taught me how to deal with that stuff. But hospital said i was ""healed"".

I moved out from my parents again and got a job in a callcenter since that was the only thing available in my hometown. I got minimum wage, had to have crazy amounts of knowledge, had extreme stats i had to reach or i was laid off and i hated every second. I was sick alot. Like ALOT. Every 2-3 weeks i had something. From colds, flu, migrane etc.

I stayed for a whole year. Eventho i was sick often i had exceptional stats. 99% customer satisfaction with extremely low talk time etc. Then i quit. I couldnt take it anymore. The constant pressure. Knowing that i will never be promoted no matter how good i am. Constant stuggle with money. I was miserable.

So i went into a different mental hospital. Did dialectic behavioural therapy instead of trauma therapy. Learned to use skills. Which is basically just finding something to occupy your brain so you stop thinking your sick sad thoughts. Does it solve anything? No, not at all. Do i feel better? No.

In therapy i found a girlfriend. She is perfect. She talks with me. She is understanding. But im struggling so hard since i have this paranoia that literally any person on this planet is just trying to hurt me. I trust her. I know that my thoughts are not real. But it hurts so fucking much. Just a few days ago she got her period. Almost 2 weeks earlier than expected. My thought process to this situation was. ""Well she was partying with her friends last weekend. She probably fucked a dude there, got Plan-B and one the side effects is that your period might come earlier or later than expected."" Like what the hell? How do you even come up with something like that? I feels like i just want to hurt myself. I should be happy. She is doing everything she can. And i cant appreciate it since my mind is just thinking up storys to hurt me. This literally makes me feel like im insane. Why would i do that to me?

Now im unemployed. Get my money from health insurance. Well for the next week that is. My psychiatrist told me that he wont be writing me sick any longer. He gave me no reason why he wont continue since he is 100% aware of my mental state. That means i dont get any money from my health insurance anymore since they think im healthy. Which means i have to get money from the state for being umemployed. Getting money from the state in my country means that you are required to apply for jobs. For ANY job that the state choses for you. If you dont apply (and show up to interviews or decline a job offer) they wont give you money. Like literally 0.

I cant work. I cant even apply for a job. Im not even able to keep my small flat clean or keep care of myself. 

I dont know what to do anymore. I just want the pain to stop.",2

"I thought my depression had lessened because i was feeling things again, but i have been sober for 2 months now and i think it was probably just the alcohol, because i don't feel like i have been becoming a lot more numb lately, not being sad feels good at least but i think a lot of the happiness has gone with it, i feel so bored.",3
You ever break up with your gf cus you want to be independent and you don't think you want to be with that person and you feel fine the first month and then after that it hits you that you'll never be able to hit that ever again or see that body or talk to them every night and you contemplate on how fucking stupid you are to do such a thing and then get depressed and a couple weeks later realize you made the right choice and then the cycle keeps repeating throughout the year,4
"I felt too overwhelmed balancing graduate-level schoolwork and a paid internship, and I felt like I wasn't getting as much done as I would have liked, wasting a lot of time. So I asked my advisor via email if I could end my contract early, for the research position I was given. 

He accepted the resignation, but I've been nervous bringing it up for weeks now. I was worried because I've been coming in late or on some days not at all. My depression is getting worse, and I feel like my antidepressant dosage is too low to be effective. I'm not sure which is a bigger black mark on my resume/needing a future recommendation for a job: not showing up to work because I'm having a depressive episode, or ending the internship to spare them from further episodes. 

It's the first time I've been employed as a STEM major, and I've completely messed it up. I only have rent money left and then, who knows. I feel so shitty and small, and mostly stupid. I can't possibly say that I've changed my mind now, it'll look too odd after all the rigamarole I went through trying to quit, emailing various advisors and internship coordinators. 

I'm so tired, and my boyfriend thinks that I've shot myself in the foot and yelled in disbelief. ""I don't know how to make it better,"" he said. 

I just don't know what to do. And I'm not sure what's more screwed up now, my financial status or my career path when grad school is over.",2

You've made promises you never intended to keep.
I've made choices so we could be together.
I've pictured a whole life for us.
And then you've changed your mind.
You've managed to destroy me. 

I shouldn't have let you destroy me. I was weak in the first place. 

What's the point of being alive and being alone? I don't have you anymore, I don't have friends. I have work and that's all. And work gets boring. You don't live just to work. 

I just feel like I'm ready to give up. I don't believe it can get better anymore, because if it does get better, it's only going to get worse afterwards. 

I'm done.",4
I deserve to suffer for everything I have done. I hope I continue to feel pain so I can make up for the shit I caused.,5
"Honestly, I don't value my life that much, and I'd rather never wake up from my sleep. I came in terms with myself, and thought maybe I could give that second chance to someone who deserves it more than me. Is that stupid? Or senseless?",5
"I've tried every path possible to stop my pain. Counseling so far seemed like it failed. I'm trying extremely hard at everything but the universe likes to play a reverse card and send me back to the put I just came from. I'm just constantly losing and whenever I do win it's only for a millisecond.

I'm literally extremely humble and nice but in a way I can't be used and the universe still trashes me for it. I'm trying just so hard.

People say it's going to get better but how it's been going only downhill and I'm doing nothing to cause this.

I always feel fake, empty, and soulless but all I want I to feel feel and be full of emotions, but the world I've seen is built to destroy me and continue to get me farther from that.

I honestly want to be able to be comforted by my friends by nothing fucking works I'm literally both an Anti-introvert and anti-extrovert,nothing works for me.

My counseler tells me to challenge my negative thoughts but really how do challenge that in a mind that the light gave up in.

I've got no where to escape but death and I'm 15.",5
"When I will turn 18 I want to kill myself. I feel like I am just a waste of space and my ""friends"" are staying with me because they pity me.

My psychiatrist knows and says it's common for people who have survived traumas and suffer from a multitude of mental and physical problems. I'm always afraid to tell anyone though or my therapist bc every time I talk about people get concerned. I don't know maybe I am alone in this but the best way to describe it is:

like a fly in a contained room. You'll always hear the buzz, and sometimes it constant and droning in your ear, but other times you can barely hear, like a soft quick buzz.

I mean its never gone away. I am only 18 but I have never had a time where I didn't think about killing myself. I'm okay now, the fly is rather quiet but like is this normal?",5

"I was diagnosed with borderline disability and it's making me suicidal and homicidal. I've never accomplished anything in my life I have no ged, no job, no licence all I want to do is get a ged so I can go to college to study a trade. Why do people with learning disability have to take the same test as people who don't have learning disability of course it would be easier for them but for us the test feels like a foreign language to me. Also I'm going to be homeless because of me nobody else fault my parents want me to stay but if they die I will be homeless anyways.",5
"It's next week, but I've had consistent panic attacks for the past week and it's becoming too much. It's too much. I've been falling off a cliff and I can see the end.

"Yesterday I stayed home from class because I didn't finish an assignment and when I told my parents they were mad. College is horrible. I can't get anything right and I feel like I'm in the wrong major, but it feels too late to change out for next semester.
During my time at home I couldn't stop myself from crying. I stayed in my room all day, not leaving for food or the bathroom. I just sat there and thought about ending it. I had a belt I could kill myself with. It felt like the only thing to do since I feel like I burden my family and friends. When I put the belt around my neck and pulled, I couldn't do it. I couldn't just leave.
My parents know I'm not doing good in school, but I could never tell them about what happened. I just need help but I feel weak or stupid going to get help. I really just wanna drop out and find a job I can work my way up from, but that'll disappoint my entire family.

Luckily, my mom isn't such an alcoholic, but she also drinks a lot. I remember, when i was a child, my parents often dont have money to buy tge food, so i used to visit my grandma, and take some food from her, to feed me and my younger brothers. i remember, once my dad came back home, so drunk, that he beated my mother,and btoke a glass door. There were a fucktone of blood.It was sticky and smelled horrible. When i was 13 i was raped by my drunk dad. Nobody knows about it. Also 2 months ago,i found a gf, but she broke with the me up. Also she was amphetamine addicted. She was mentally unstable. She had a lot of overdose. Honestly I miss her. I feel like i don't have future. I was born because condom ripped, and anti pregnant tablets wasn't working. I feel useless. I live in a small town in Western Ukraine. My town is a fucking shithole of the Europe.

It would make it so much easier on my family and friends. And in a masochistic way I like the idea of withering away, which is probably why I don't eat. I just feel so worthless and stupid. I'm going nowhere in life. My boyfriend doesn't love me enough and doesn't know how or bother to help when I'm down. I think he might just stick around out of pity but I can feel that and it sucks and it's not enough for me if it's not real love. I just really need to shout into this void for a minute because I don't feel worthy of taking up the energy or my friends or the time or a crisis line or something. I think I'm going to be alone forever, and I wish so hard that I was strong enough to not care about that. I wish I was enough.

I wish i could somehow be better and go back to being happy, but I know I'm fucked beyond repair. I have no hope in anything and I'm scared of the future because I don't see myself in it. I need help but I'm so embarrassed to tell anyone I have depression and idk why. I feel like I don't deserve their help. I should just stay quiet and suffer on my own.",1
"Hi guys. I've been struggling with a relapse into severe depression for the last couple of months. I've been seeing a psychiatrist who has changed me onto new meds, and I'm slowly starting to come good, but the last couple of days I've been in a deep funk, just not interested in doing anything, not eating, barely talking. I've spent most of my time in bed, or watching youtube, or both. I don't know if it's the change in meds (probably) or what, but I wanted to share a ridiculous moment I just had. 

My dog (a 5yo kelpie named Max) walked into my room, and nudged his butt against my knee like he does when he wants pats. I wasn't feeling it, and nudged him away. He came back, sat down on my foot, and let rip with a huge fart. Right on my foot. I started laughing - I haven't laughed in the last couple of days - and I kept laughing for a solid five minutes. I opened the window to clear the air (also haven't opened the window in the last couple of days) and all of a sudden the funk was over. It was like he poured cold water over my head and my vision cleared. I'm sitting at my desk in the fresh air, still smiling, and about to start on some uni work I have to get a jump on. Max is napping on my bed like the champion he is.

Things can be so dark for so long that it can be hard to imagine anything different. I don't know what your version of your dog farting on your foot is, but when it comes, try to let it pull you out of the funk. I'm not well yet, and probably won't be back to normal for another month or so, but I'm getting there.",1
"So there was this girl that I've known since forever, but years ago I ended up having a major crush on her. After, me and her started talking more and becoming close friends. We went for a few years of talking for a few months, her pushing away then a few months later texting me out of the blue and repeat. Almost 2 years ago we stared talking again and it was great. Her house every weekend doing stupid shit like watching Youtube videos, music, and Netfix till like 11 at night. We also ended up talking feelings stuff which I never do, like I'm an emotional guy, but I don't show it. But I kinda felt like I was like I was living for the weekends, that and spending time at lunch in school. Like we weren't dating, but we were super close friends and we had talked about how I felt about her, but she wasn't sure how she felt. After hanging out less and less for a few months, we graduated. That night she sent a text about how she felt and that I had pushed to much and we haven't talked since. That was about a year ago. I don't blame her, at the time I was scared of losing her and I just kept pushing. But it hasn't gotten any better I still miss her more than ever. I honestly feel like there is something wrong with me, holding on for so long, and I feel really lost not having her in my life. Part of really wants to try talking to her again, but I'm afraid that will just hurt her more than I already have. I don't want commit suicide, but I really don't want to exist. I'm lost and don't feel like its ever going to get better. None of this is her fault, I am the reason I am broken and she might be too.",4
"I might become homeless. Just had an episode and spent my savings, can't bring myself to work more than
15 hours a week.
I binged on xanies and fucked a stranger the other night, I've been hanging out with a married man. The man I really love can't handle me but won't let me go for some fucking reason. I have no support system, everyone's only halfway there for me because I'm just too unpredictable and sick for anyone to consistently keep up with my needs.

I just turned 26, I wanted to do something with my life by now, I can't even handle a ft job and my adulthood has been a clusterfuck of mental illness and grief. I need to be on drugs but I'm terrified of them bc I'm so low functioning that my life will be ruined if they make me any worse. It's been like this for years. Years!!!!!! I don't know how to get better, I see my other mentally ill friends not getting better, and the older I get the more worried I am that I'll have no choice but to concede to the reality of a lifelong struggle w/o much hope for anything even remotely resembling security/ property/ prosperity/ FAMILY

I'm jealous of high functioning people.
I just want to be that someday.
I'm so tired.
Thanks for reading",2
"21, M, in college. Homeless in college. I feel so sad, so mad, it's all really bad. I feel as if there's nothing to really do. I feel stressed all the time. The only thing that keeps me going is music. I sing and play guitar and write songs everyday and post a new album about every month. Currently learning how to mix and record music on my own. That's the only thing that makes me happy. Just going to continue writing and recording songs until I'm 30, then end it all. By then I'll hopefully sound really nice with all those years of practice. I've thought of this idea two weeks ago, and I feel a bit better. Don't worry as much, since I know it'll all end soon.",2
People say self isolating is bad and you shouldn't do it and should surround yourself with friends and family but honestly sometimes self isolating is less hurtful. Self isolation protects me from the disappointment of other people's actions. I can be there for every single other person whatever reason and whenever and the second I'm sinking no one seems to notice or no one seems to take it seriously enough to really care. When all u get is disappointment when you see these people it gets draining so yeah that's why I self isolate. I'm sick of getting hurt by getting disappointed.,1
But I still feel like it's an inevitable thing. Even if I am scared of dying I feel like at some point I'll just kill myself on autopilot,0
"I post here and never get any responses but whatever.

I'm going to be turning 20 this year and waking up every morning is getting harder. I feel so lost and like I have no direction. I took a mental health day off from work and all it did was show me how much I don't do. I feel like I have no hobbies, I try play games but I lose interest after 5 minutes, I try work on Writing or Drawing and I lose any motivation almost instantly. The only way I can get any satisfaction is masturbation and afterwards I always feel disgusted with myself. I've tried going to school 2 times now and had to drop out halfway through the semester both times. I just want to stop existing but I don't want to hurt everyone around me.",5

"I remember the past few weeks were the ones in the summer where I wasn't able to see you much. I felt so sick, not because I couldnt see you, but because I knew I would. The fact that everytime I seen you, you acted as if you loved me so much. Why did you? I never understood and I couldnt comprehend. I didnt believe you the slightest. And even the day I broke it off with you for the first time, I didnt understand why you seemed to be on the verge of crying. I didn't even say it out loud that I thought we weren't going to last, you just read me like a book. Whenever you read me, did i seem pathetic? All I felt was numb. My heartless self watched you walk away, and the last feeling id feel for a long time walked away too. I wish I could tell you about it all. I loved you so much. I tell these lies, apologizing how I didnt appreciate you enough then, telling lies to my friends about how I really felt. My only desire was to die, the quickest way to get it done was to get rid of you. In the end, I didnt die, but at the same time I did. I didn't even have enough energy to tie a knot or swallow any meds, it even felt so heavy to blink. Im horrible for acting like i hated you after, you acted like you hated me. I dont blame you for it, for me it was just a way to not let my pride down. We grew back together, we were so close. It got to the point we felt for eachother again. But I didnt understand why I was still fucking numb. I didnt want to be with you, I wasnt ready. I wanted to die. Everytime I almost did it, id somehow end up back where I started. I hurt you so much. Somehow, some way, we got through it. You never found out how I really felt. We made it. Im better. I love you so much. Everyday I'm wallowing in self hatred, because of the pain I caused you. Yet you had believed you were in the wrong? I don't understand that, i never will. You're always in my mind. I want to die, but I push through it for you. So I can see you once again every day. My greatest fear, will be the day you say ""I love you"" for the very last time.",4
Boom clickbait. What's like ya know? The easiest quickest to kill yourself? Jumping off a building seems too cliche plus there's the social awkwardness of getting past the secretary at a business building to get you to a top floor.,5
"It's your average story everyone's heard: no friends, broken family, bullied throughout elementary and high school, rough breakup, only escapes through drugs and self harm. I just can't take it anymore i feel so worthless, I'm turning 18 this year and i think i can no longer go on like this i've wanted to die since i was 11. why is life so painful every day is a constantly struggle for me and i can't even find motivation to keep going on. I cant even picture myself as an adult, i see nothing. These are all just words i cant even put together properly without autocorrect cause i'm crying too much, i just want to feel okay. How does being loved feel like? I've only felt it once with someone who changed their mind and started caring about somebody else in that particular way and broke off all contact with me. I'm so tired of people giving me â€œtough loveâ€ and saying my decisions are selfish, i know i am, it's just making it worst. I just want it all to stop, but it never did. â€œIt gets betterâ€ is burned into my mind but when does it? I've been trying so hard to continue on and make improvements but it always ends back at square one. I've never been this insistent on dying in my life, there are only liars and shitty people on this earth. Nobody seems to care or listen unless there's something in for them",4
"I want to live. I'm a little, cheerful girl. I love music. Whenever I'm about to go to sleep, I take my pink mp3 player to my bed and listen to my favorite songs for hours while imagining myself as a skydiver, princess or a superhero! As I dive into the blue sky I scream so loud that my throat hurts. Maybe if I'm loud enough I won't be able to hear my mother's epileptic seizure as the nice paramedic asks me what I've been reading and if school is going good. I try to ignore my grandma crying while my grandfather just looks away from what is happening. School is going good, I'm really enjoying my art classes. The teacher says that I have some potential and that I'm a pleasure to have in class. Maybe because I rarely talk. I like when my teacher praises me, it makes me feel like I'm special - I think as I sit on my bed, with one of my CDs playing in the background.

I'm in middle school. I live in the city now. My school is bigger, more modern and it even has a cafeteria. It's always crowded yet somehow empty at the same time. I no longer have art classes. My teachers say that I'm smart but kind of lazy. All of the girls are so pretty. My cheeks are chubbier than theirs, my legs are thicker and my belly is sticking out. I skip my lunch. Looking at pictures of gorgeous and thin girls on the internet makes me feel full. I hate PE classes. I'm the only girl that can't play volleyball. I hit the ball really hard and now my hoodie is stained red. It hurts but I pretend nothing has happened. Nobody notices. 

High school is scary. Boys don't really like me. Maybe because of the way I dress or because I cut my hair very short. Starving becomes binging. I really hate my thighs. I'm the class clown. I skip school every day for a week. I overdose on medication several times. One time I almost fall down the stairs and pass out in my bathtub after overdosing on some pills. I try to kill myself. When in the ER one of my teachers is there. She looks at me. I can barely stay awake. One of the nurses tells me that I'm selfish. After coming back from hospital my teachers say that I'm the laziest student they've ever had. My mother forces me to lie so they won't put me in a psychiatric facility. I go to the psychiatrist once and never go back. Now my grandma sleeps in my room and they look through my stuff every day. I have to ask to go to the bathroom. My mom makes me stay in the guest room with only a bed, a desk and my textbooks. Dinner tastes awful. I want to die. 

College starts. My major is not that great. I have literature classes. I'm a very average student. Sometimes I remember my elementary school art teacher. I feel like I failed her. Boys still don't like me. My cheeks are still way too chubby. My body is covered in white thick lines. People stare a lot. Some ask questions some just avoid me. I still imagine and fantasize before going to sleep a lot. Skydiving turned into jumping off a bridge into a river, grand parties and colorful dresses turned into lonely college dorms, oversized t-shirts, and old sweaters, I no longer am a superhero, now I'm the one waiting for someone or something to save me. I no longer scream, I no longer put up a fight. I remember loving music but now it just gives me a headache. I'm an almost 21-year-old, tired woman. I no longer want to live. 

Goodnight.",2

I dont even know why im doing this, idk what im looking for by posting. So... im very ashamed of my problems to the point where i feel ashamed writing this to the strangers that i wont ever see in my life... Since like 15 years ago my problem has been bad breath... and i really mean bad... cant erase it even directly after i brushed my teeth ... i have been trying to heal this sickness for a long time now with little success. Been to many doctors (free health care) i dont live in the US. Obviously im unemployed and cant afford to pay for the doctor, i stopped trying to go to the doctors after one of the doctor just laughed at me and my sickness... not literally but i could just feel how he didnt care at all and gave me a vibe of 'its not a sickness go home' So imagine me struggling to even talk openly to the doctor about it and receiving the 'ur nuts not sick' threatment from him. Im sure for people that dont have this problem its hard to understand why is it so hard for me? Let me put it like that , how would u feel if u stepped in a shit and couldnt wipe it off?Would u be comfortable walking around? standing next to someone? talking to someone? Obviously i dont even need to talk for someone to smell it, breathing thru nose is like same result, i got anxiety just by standing to someone, going to the shop is like climbing mount everest for me. I will achieve nothing in this life, none will want to have anything to do with person who smells... none will ever take serious someone like that... I just want to be able to interact with people...",5
"I think I'm going to kill myself some time within the next week, but I wanted to make sure I'm doing my due diligence before making any rash decisions. I've already fixed my diet, created a stable exercise routine, received therapy, reached out to my support group, and contacted the suicide hotline.

I'm not going to explain why I want to commit suicide, but I do want to ask what I should think of before choosing to make the ultimate decision. I'm not talking about, ""Think of how sad your mom will be!"" Rather, the idea that if I killed myself in my apartment, the police might accuse my roommate of murder, or if I were to jump off a building, someone would have to identify my mangled body.

Can anyone tell me what else I need to consider before killing myself?",5

"When I was 15-16 years old, I posted here in my darkest moments. I couldn't see any reason to keep living. I thought I was nothing special and the next 8 years seemed like an endless slog. You can look through my post history if you want. 

Since then, I graduated college and graduate school. I have traveled the world. I swam with bioluminescent algae in Indonesia. I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world, and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn't kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become.

Before you think about killing yourself, remember that you don't know how beautiful your life could become. How could you? You have no way of knowing until you get there. But you need to be alive.",1

I have had a few other points in my life when I had these thoughts and even tried to give into them. I just wish I wasnt a pussy. My problem is that I want to die but every time I try I end up either chickening out or waking up alive. I deserve nothing but death but nothing ever works. I'm drowning in my own self destruction and I'm scared someone's gonna try to help me. I love my friends,boyfriend, and my dad but I'm so tired of trying to be an interesting person for everyone but I'm scared their going to see that I'm really just a blank paper and leave me. How many more times do I have to re write my suicide note until I have a use for it?",5
"I've been combatting them for years and they are so strong they prevent me from being a functional member of society. I've (sort of) attempted suicide twice within the last 8 years. And I wish I just went more balls deep with it when I did. 

I've been inpatient in mental hospitals, I've done IOP programs, PHP programs, DBT, CBT, etc. for over 13 years and even after following all of these things I've learned, the suicidal thoughts always win. I've been on prescription after prescription and some may help lessen the frequency but they never actually go away. 

I can't tell my therapist (or any professional) these things because I'll instantly be admitted. I'm already $1000+ in debt with medical bills from hospitalizations and therapy, and I can't afford another useless admission. All hospitalizations are is just a cash grab and a reason to house suicidal people and bankrupt them while profiting off of their health insurance. 

I don't even have the energy or willpower to go to work anymore. But my boss will fire me if I miss another day of work. But I can't go to the doctors to get a doctor's note or provide any excuse as to why I didn't come in or else I'll be hospitalized. I don't care if I get evicted and lose my cats and all my belongings and have to live out of my car. I just can't function in a work environment when feeling this way. 

It just feels like a vicious circle/catch 22 that I can't seem to fucking break. Everyone around me just calls me weak and leaves me because I'm such a burden. I've always had this small fear in me of the â€œkilling myselfâ€ process - the fear of feeling my skull hit the pavement if I jump off of a building; or the fear of feeling myself asphyxiating as a noose constricts all blood flow and airflow to my brain; or the fear of feeling all my organs shut down before my brain does if I overdose. But lately, those fears are becoming less and less of an issue where I'd rather just bite the bullet and be done with it.",2
"I live abroad (Netherlands) and I my friend from Chicago is really struggling with depression. I want to do anything I can in order to help him, but I can do only so much from this far, and I feel useless/helpless.

"Was freaking out yesterday, broke crap and screamed and cussed about his money problems and stuff, then calmed down. Well he's back at it again today. Saying I don't do anything around the house, and admitted that my brother has apparently been texting him and talk crap about me behind my back as well. Saying that I should do more to help out cause he apparently thinks I can keep up by myself with our two story house and doesn't realize I'm depressed cause he's an idiot. Then my dad start screaming about how I'm making his life hard and how I should just leave. And that he's gonna start charging me rent and if I can't afford I can get out of his house. I have work in a few hours and I don't think I can go. Not only cause I need him for a ride but how am I supposed to function at work after this. I'm literally holding one of my dads handguns in my lap that he gave me for self defense if ever needed. I've never thought so hard or wanted so bad to just quit being a wimp and pull the trigger? Should I? I don't see a point in going on. If I do, I'll just have to go through this all over again. I want it over. I'm also thinking of sending a photo to my brother, at least to scare the crap out of him. Maybe then he'll think twice before talking behind my back to a man who's mentally unstable again.",2

"I'm tired of faking confidence, because if you're not confident, no one will talk to you. I'm tired of faking happiness. I'm tired of being me. If you look at my post history, its all just complaining because I have no one else to tell, so I come to reddit. Complaining is all I'm good for. I dont have any worth, and my whole life is evidence that proves it. If I had the balls to actually kill myself, I probably would, but I'm afraid of hurting myself and death. I just can't take it anymore. I know that no one will save me, so I guess I'm just doomed to a life of below negative self esteem, perpetual loneliness and feeling sorry for myself.",1
"My friends keep talking about how they need therapy and I just stand there thinking about how I have tried starving my self and the fresh yeets on my ankle that I made in the basement of the library we meet in with a random pair of scissors I found. 

No one seems to notice when I'm sad but when the more popular people are sad everyone notices and everyone cares, no one even says anything when I bearly talk and when I do it's just a mumble.

People always says that you should talk to people when you feel sad or depressed but who do I talk to when every time I try no one understands.

Sorry to bother u I just needed to vent",5
"as the title states my parents always thought I was lazy in my highschool days, but I was just unbelievably depressed. Can anyone else relate? 

was I lazy at times? Hell yea brother but isn't everyone at some point? They'd call me lazy if I hung out in my bedroom, didn't shower, ect went on for all my highschool days even when I was on a football team my whole highschool life never came home till 6 and was gone Friday/Saturday nights out with friends, cleaned up as much as a teenager does. 

My point being why didn't my parents ever sit me down and talk to me and explain it? I remember having tears coming down my face as 14 year old me held a knife in the kitchen as my step dad walked towards the laundry room I had a sigh of relief that someone would help but he didn't mention it or see me or talk to me. I feel like if they would've just sat me down after seeing these signs they'd know and I'd be way better developed then I am now cause I'm just learning these things now. I had no idea it was even depression I thought something was wrong with me, still do till this day. They determined I was the quiet one and didn't like to talk much but up until highschool I never had that problem, I felt like I got sunk into a depression and never really came out of it and now I'm stuck being profiled as this guy I'm not, even when I speak I get spoken over like it's a primal thing or them trying to shun my words? 

I don't want people to think my parents where bad they were great but I just don't understand it at all. For me when I have kids I'd make sure to see the quiet signs 

Thanks for listening",4
"I'm so tired of the rollercoaster ride of this mental illness. I know i have come a long way, but the depression and anxiety is always in the back talking to me. At times I want to give up because I'm so tired of facking and fighting the demons in my head. I try so hard to stay positive, but at the end of the day those emotions come back telling myself that it's not worth it.",3

Not being lonely because you have someone you can rely on seems so nice. I'll go to as many training sections that I have to. Go for a beer with the team. The trash talk. 

I went through middle school, high school and college without playing any sports. I wish my parents forced me into it or that I force myself. But now I'm 24. I can't run 2 minutes without being out of breath. I'm unhealthy. I snore like a pig.",5

"I suffered with depression for many years, and haven recently reached a turning point in my life where I finally feel good again, but somethings a little off, all my emotions are less extreme, sadness passes in minutes now and is nowhere near the intensity is was before, but I feel this weird longing to feel an emotion to that same depth and extreme again, has anyone else experienced this? Or am I going mad?
It's like I was so used to the emotion everything else feels uncomfortable now.

I feel so stupid for feeling like this, I'm lucky enough to (it appears so far) gotten past the darkness that defined my teens and early adulthood, and I have this sick lust to feel it again?

It also come with this constant creeping fear that this â€˜ok'ness I'm feeling now is a facade, that soon something will happen and I will fall back into my old state instantly.

The conflict of this fear and the longing is driving me a little mad.
I can't talk to anyone I know about it because I'm pretty sure I'm gonna sound insane, so I guess I'm asking you guys.

TLDR: recovered from depression but missing the depth to which I felt emotions before, missing the release that comes with sadness of that extreme, every other emotion feels a little uncomfortable now, Anyone else experienced this?",5

I took xanax to calm myself down but this lingering feeling of something might happen to me is really bothering me. I also have other bad memories of being left alone so I'm assuming those memories are also affecting me. I'm really scared and I hope I have someone or even a pet that can keep my company.

"I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try. I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but been unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars then needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later..

I just literally can't take anymore of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum. I am just so tired of fighting and so tired of going through life like this barely being able to breath and barely being able to survive and have absolutely nothing to show for it.",3

My reasons you will probably laugh at if I told you. Would probably tell me this and that and other shit. Tell me to get the fuck over it but again, I'm at the point where I look at ways to kill myself knowing I CAN'T. Because I know I will fuck up other people. 

I am in living fucking Purgatory.

"I never had a best friend. I'd never been part of a friend group. Or *a* group for that matter. I never felt accepted, not at my temporary job as a waiter, not in online chats, not in my class. Never had a girlfriend. Never kissed. Never had sex. Never had someone compliment me. Never had an unforgettable holiday trip. Never had a memorable spring break or summer break. Never went to a cool festival. Never had a great party. Never hosted one either. The list goes on and on and on. I feel lonely and my depression is physically weighing down on me. I have no motivation to do anything any more and my parents say they can read that off my face. 

I legit cannot remember the last time I had fun. Why would I even bother going on like this when I feel like I am just surviving each day rather than living. I am almost tempted to move to another country, start anew, and just go entirely crazy, but I feel like I would carry on the same way and be even more depressed. Everyone around me has so much fun but me. Last week I overheard two normal guys around my age discussing their plans for the summer and some crazy memories. I wanted to kill myself so badly hearing what I missed out on. FUCK",5
"And I don't know where to begin
Words used to come naturally 
And now they feel dead. 

So I'm not going to try. 

I don't know where my life is going and I don't know why I am here. Things seem to be spinning out of control and I just don't know how to stop things from moving. I got fired from my job for being sick, for being chronically ill. I'm doing the best I can, and being sick never effected my work performance. I belong in a hospital â€” but not as a patient. I am supposed to be a nurse nowâ€”I am 24. I was dead set on nursing school from the time I was a little girl. I'm supposed to be making little kids laugh as chemo flows into their veins. But no. I have a port a cath myself and nursing school seems so far away. I don't know what I am doing. I don't know what is going on in my relationship ship. I don't know what is going on with my body. I go to the Mayo Clinic in two weeks so they can see what the fuck is wrong with me. I just feel like I have no control and I don't know which way to turn. I'm trying my hardest to get through. I feel like I have no direction. Next week I don't have any work lined up and then the week after I go to mayo. Alone. And I am starting to freak out. I mean I have traveled alone before, many times. But this is different. I am going to be poked and prodded and scanned and all of these things and I'm scared. And I will be alone. My boyfriend, who lives with me, but am now in an open relationship with and he came out as bisexual recently and we are slowly drifting apart so he can see what living life as a bi/gay man is like, will experience what it is like to be alone. To be in the house without me. And I don't know what I will come home to. And Jesus there is just so much going on my head hurts. K. Done rambling. I'm sad. I hate being sad.",4

"I'm not a believer of anything spiritual or supernatural, but it truly does feel like I was cursed with bad luck or some shit.

A lot of it is just small things. Constantly getting the worst loot in video games, missing the public bus by like 30 seconds, etc. I always make small personal bets with myself like if I get a notification on Instagram I'll just be like ""I bet this specific person didn't like this post"" and I look at the notification and it's exactly that. This kind of shit is constantly happening everyday. By themselves it's not bad at all, but it really builds up and starts eating away at you.

And then there's bigger things. Like being 5'2 as a male is pretty bad. I have mental illnesses and some of it I can't even relate with other mentally ill people. I get bronchitis like every fucking year. And then tonight, I just got news that a field trip to Hawaii that I've been looking forward to for FOUR FUCKING YEARS has been cancelled because of the coronavirus bullshit. Of course it had to be the ONE FUCKING YEAR IM A SENIOR AND ABLE TO GO.

It just all piles up so fucking much. I feel like I'll just constantly have bad luck in life. It makes me lose excitement in things I'm actually excited for because I'm just in that mindset that it'll go wrong because of my bad luck. Makes me wonder if it's even worth living if I'm just stuck with this shit. Again, I don't believe in karma or the supernatural or anything, but this shit really makes me question it.",3

"I used to be concerned with my image too, until once I came up with a little thought experiment.

Imagine that you live in a world where you look to others the way you feel, and depending on how good you feel inside how good you appear to others. This is kind of real for hormones and these produce pheromones. Anyone can feel a certain way within, and this has a direct impact in others. Not only that, but the fact that most of the time you are not looking at yourself, the only thing you percieve of yourself is how you feel, so focus on just that.

&amp;#x200B;

We live in a world where everyone is self conscious, so never think people are observing you more than that people are just focused on how the world percieves them, just what happens to you, so come out of that mental trancestate and be one of the few people that can burst out of that bubble.",5
5 days ago i slit my wrists again. I was feeling like absolute shit and wanted a reason for why i felt like i did. My boyfriend found out today and it really got to him and it made me feel worse bc i didn't consider how he could feel if i hurt myself. I want to do it again but i know deep down i shouldn't.

I know what I should do but I really don't know how to do any of those things even if they are seemingly easy... I'm skipping classes and work and asking for assignment extensions, and I'm honestly having a hard time just staying awake and getting out of bed.

I feel like I'm just being lazy? I'm still on meds and seeing a therapist but I sometimes wonder if I'm just faking it... I just feel so defeated because now I can't even do basic tasks and I'm on my bed or couch all day and my best friend thinks I need to just get my ass up because I know what I should do? However I can't do any of those things that I should do...

"In October, I was assaulted by my then ex-boyfriend. Even though we had broken up in August, I had reached out to him because he was one of the few people who knew that it was the year anniversary of the first time I was assaulted. And then he raped me. 

Since then, nothing has been good for me. I've had to withdraw from the semester because I've been too depressed to go to any classes. My relationships are falling apart because I'm not acting like myself anymore and no one wants to be around me. Or maybe I just want to be alone, I don't know. I don't sleep at night because I don't feel safe in my own bed after what happened. And I feel like there's no one I can talk to about anything because they're all sick of hearing about it. Even the people I know I can trust aren't options. If I told my mom or dad, they'd make me move back home, and that would just make things so much worse. My closest friends would try to push me to get hospitalized, which my family can't afford. I stopped seeing my therapist because I felt like whenever I tried to open up emotionally, she would change the subject. I don't know what to do or who to talk to anymore. 

I've wanted to kill myself before, and I've actually had several suicide attempts. Something about this time feels different. I know what I would do, and I'm not sure if I'm more afraid that it would actually work this time, or afraid of the slight possibility I could still survive. I know I don't want to die, really, and that I just want the pain to stop. But there's nothing I can do that makes anything feel easier anymore and I don't know if I have the energy to keep trying. 

I'm not sure what I'm hoping to get from posting here. I'm not even sure if I want to kill myself yet. I just don't have anyone else I can talk to but I need someone to hear that I'm struggling right now.",1
"Exactly a year ago, I turned up at my gf's (now ex) house. She wanted to be angry with me that day, she was walking towards me about to explode.... But I picked her up and ran away with her. She forgot even why she wanted to be angry with me for, we went IKEA to look at new stuff for her apartment and then we went to a cafe in which I took a selfie of us. We were so happy and cute together. That selfie popped up on my one year memories.

Fast forward to now, we've been separated since end of October last year. She doesn't talk with me, she removed me from everything except Facebook. 

I am hurting every fucking day. I remember her, I remember all the good times we had, I remember the future plans we had with each other. I don't know exactly when she turned from loving me to leaving me. But I just wish she spoke to me about any concerns she was having. I made my mistakes too by not understanding exactly what she wanted. 

I just want that happiness we had a year ago. I just miss her so much. We both wanted to get married, but I told her, once I finish school or get a job, we will get married!

"Ever since I came to the States for college, I've just been in a depressive state of mind. School killed my passion for what I wanted to do with a shit ton of work and almost no free time to myself. I want to change schools/take a gap year, but I am unable to do that due to financial reasons. I don't have friends in school. I have classmates, but they feel more like coworkers who are just concerned about themselves and their own career, more than friends. My family doesn't feel like a family; it's a nightmare where everyone hates each other. 

I used to be a very optimistic guy with very little pessimism. But now, I feel like my pessimistic side has taken over me. I *think* that there's an inner voice that tells me that I should go ahead and kill myself because it's an easy solution to every single problem I have. I also noticed that I'm not being my original self anymore. I lose patience way faster than I used to, I get upset more easily, and so much more. I feel like I've lost my own self. I don't know who I am anymore. Everything seems pointless and nothing motivates me to work hard and live life anymore.

BUT I know I shouldn't act on suicide. I understand that it's wrong and selfish. And my reasons to suicide are not reasonable AT ALL. I keep telling myself that I'm just in a rough patch of life and it's just a small hill that I'd have to climb over. 

School, on the other hand, is just a lot of work. The stress piled up from the amount of work, family issues, financial concerns, **and** my depressive shit thoughts does not help at all. Further, my procrastination absolutely fucked me over this semester. I'm going to fail my classes and probably have to retake them. My parents are going to be crazy mad at me, yet I don't care for some reason. My concerns aren't at school, but at life itself.

I don't know what to do. I don't know what I should do. I can't tell if I became a lazy person and now I'm trying to justify my laziness or if this is just my body's response to a lot of stress accumulated over the years.

I hate the state of mind that I am in. I hate that I think too much. I hate myself for allowing myself to become this person.",2
"I don't like to complain and so I don't talk about my depression a lot to my friends/loved ones, I don't want to worry them or be annoying. It's been getting progressively worse recently though, I'm dropping weight like crazy (I've never had it interfere with weight before), when I do try to talk about it, things get minimized and nobody really gives a f*ck. I had my s/o tell me that I was â€œnot really sadâ€ yesterday, and that messed with me because not only has he not known me for the majority of my life, but just because I don't like to talk about my problems doesn't mean they don't exist. He really has no idea. My mom is a therapist so when I try to talk to her she just gets overly worried, and my dad generally follows her lead with that. I understand why they worry, a couple years ago I had a pretty bad suicide attempt and a near fatal overdose (od was an accident, I was just being dumb) within less than 6 months of each other, they worry that it'll happen again. It gets annoying though because I feel like I can't even say I'm sad without â€œare you on drugs againâ€ etc. Now that I think about it maybe this post doesn't make sense/ is all over the place, I guess it's easier to vent to strangers on the internet than the people in my life.",3

I've been at the edge for a long time now, but I'm just exhausted at this point. I just can't.

I can tell that i'm isolating myself from all of my friends. I rarely answer texts and if i'm invited to go out, i either don't respond or make up an excuse. Lots of people have told me they miss seeing me but no one has considered asking me how i'm doing. I feel like i'm being selfish by wanting them to ask me how i am rather than going to them and talking about how badly i'm struggling to just go about my everyday life. I also don't want to go to them with this kind of thing because it's a pretty heavy topic to just bring up out of the blue and i don't want to scare anyone. I don't even know if any of this makes sense so maybe someone else has felt similarly?",5
"Lately I've been experiencing more and more suicidal thoughts, I cry all the time and worry about everything. I feel like I have nothing going for me in my life and that the better years are behind me. 
I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 17 (I'm now 25), and have been on fluoxetine on and off, and on various doses, since then. On valentine's Day this year I was put on Zoloft after finally going back to the doctors. I have had CBT and counseling in the past but just nothing seems to work and it's all too much for me to cope with. 
I've spent the majority of today researching suicide methods because I just can't cope anymore. 
I'm sorry for posting but I just don't know what to do.",3
"The thoughts of a 30-year-old depressed guy. I am afraid of, well not afraid but the things I think about on a regular basis. I worry if my daughter will be taken away from because of my crazy ex-wife. I worry about what my daughter thinks or will think of me because I have no goals or ambitions right now other than to make enough money to outshine my ex-wife. I want to do all these things, but I am too worried about everything that will go wrong with them. I want to start a business and be successful, but I am afraid of failure and getting stuck right back where I am, which is like resetting my whole life. I worry about if I am going to get cancer because I am addicted to chewing tobacco and want to stop for my daughters sake because I don't want it to influence her life because I have been told it is bad for you. I worry about being alone the rest of my life because I can't seem to find anyone who loves me or is it because I am to shallow and don't think anyone over 150 lbs. is pretty. I can't sleep because my mind races and races at night and these things flow through my mind. I worry about looking successful to the people around me which holds me back because I don't want to show how unsuccessful I am right now. I feel like a failure and a worthless person. the only thing that gets me through the really really tough thoughts is my daughter. And if I wasn't here who would raise her. The pressure around me to do the right thing is tremendous but what is the right thing? Is the right thing what everyone thinks or what is socially acceptable? Is the right thing what I think is right? but then why do other people think some of the things I do are wrong? What makes them right? I think about the things in my past that I could have done differently but what's the point? I can't change them so why do I dwell on them? Do I need to even worry about them? I worry about how I am going to pay for things if I lose my VA disability but I don't want to go to my VA appointments because I feel it reinforces the fact that I am messed up and I come up with excuses as to why I shouldn't go. to try to reason with myself as to why its ok not to go. It's also a distance away which wastes 2 hours of my days sitting at home doing nothing. So is it helpful to go to an appointment and lie to a doc for 15 mins telling him that every things ok and I take meds, Which I don't take my meds because 1 I hate taking medication every day and 2 I don't like to think taking them helps but they do because if I took them then I might not be writing this. I know I need to do better but I work at a dead-end job that has no future for me. I am just a pawn in someone else's business story. I want to make more money, but I don't know where to go because no one is telling me where to go and I am afraid to start anything just to fail. I don't want to waste my time doing something and have that time taken from me by an unforeseen event. But why do I worry about an unforeseen event when I can't even see it coming. Is my life that messed up that I am worried about something that may or may not happen. I sit here typing this looking into my baby monitor telling myself I need to do better for my daughter. What example am I setting for her if I don't do anything with my life. I thought I had my whole life planned out then boom my world is rocked by an unhealthy relationship which everyone but me saw. Everyone told me I shouldn't have been with that girl. Everyone told me I needed to leave her. But as clichÃ© (why did I just look up how to spell clichÃ© in something I am only going to read) as it sounds, I loved her. Or at least what I thought was love. I was ready to spend my life with her, but she went and fucked two other people and who knows how many others. But blamed me because she thought I had an affairâ€¦. Which I didn't have an affair. I write this hoping my feelings will leave my body and I will not worry about them anymore. But for how long is it going to last? Is this really going to help? Maybe I'll post this on some reddit website and become famous for it. Ha who am I kidding. I am nobody. I am a middle age man who has been handed a fucked-up life and can't get out. But it's not as fucked up as some people's lives so why does mine hurt so bad? Maybe I am stuck on the materialistic things and want to hide behind them. Like having a nice truck but not as nice as the one I want because I am smart enough not to burry myself in debt and have that looming over me. I am content on doing nothing but am afraid of everything. I tell myself I am meant for more, but I don't know how to get there. I am smart but not smart enough to figure out how to make myself happy. So, am I really that smart? I can tell you all night and day that I am smarter than what I am doing right now but have nothing to show for it. I think everyone is out to get me in some way shape or form, I don't trust anyone, I think they all have some agenda to serve themselves but don't we all. Is anyone truly selfless? Now I am just rambling to ramble so focus, focus on why I am writing this. Focus focus focus why why am I handed a dealt of cards that has no instructions? is that life? What's the purpose? Why do I even waste my time? Why can't I win the lottery and hide behind the money at least I will be able to do the things that make me happy because I won't be constrained by money? But if I did have it would I really be HAPPY? I think it would be better than where I am. But why would I be so lucky as to win the lottery when there are stronger people out there who deserve it more than me? is luck a figment of our imaginations? are all the strings being pulled by some divine or supreme power? Some might say I am on drugs right now to think like this. I'm not. This is how my mind works and I think it's a blessing and a curse. Who will even read this? Now it's just becoming to long for the quick reader to think it's interesting and too short for anyone to take it seriously but I'm not writing it for them I am writing it for myself. I want to get better I want to do better. But where are the answers? Do I make up the answers and hope I get by? Do I tell lies and belittle other people to get through life? Why not? It feels like other people, all people do it to me. Who is coming to punish those who do me wrong? Do I do it? No, why? because I am afraid of the consequences. I am pressured by everyone to do the right thing. Maybe that's what governs people? Then why doesn't everyone act the same? Are there to many questions in this? Who cares? Its mine right, maybe I will share this so someone can laugh, someone can feel empowered to do the same? Someone can belittle me? I need to do better I need to push myself to do better. I started working out because I thought I might get laid if I look better. But is anyone even going to notice? I wasn't in shape before and got laid, sort ofâ€¦ I more or less have always found the girl who is in need and made her feel better, then when that wears off, I am aloneâ€¦ am I going to be alone for the rest of my life? At least I have my daughter, right? But eventually she will leave me too because no one wants to be around someone as depressed as meâ€¦ I wouldn't want to be around me. I always hear this saying on the radio or tv or what have you â€œ you have to love yourself before anyone can love youâ€â€¦ who am I kidding I will always be alone because I don't see myself loving myself. I am fat, ugly and stupid. I don't have any value. I don't have the ability to love anyone else because I just want to use the other person to make myself feel better. But how is that? Does that even make sense? Am I connecting with anyone? If this is circulating around and you are reading this far, then possibly? Should I keep going? Maybe I still feel like going. My fingers are starting to hurt but it feels a little better to not have all these things bottled up inside me. Maybe it's because I am pretending to type it to an imaginary audience. so, things I worry about. I worry about paying bills, but I am good at financial stuff. So that's ok but I still worry about them. I worry that I am not doing the right thing. I worry about what other people think of me but that's ridiculous. I should not worry about that right? I worry about the spelling in this, but I have spell check. I worry about sleeping all day when I have my daughter because she could hurt herself because she is 2. I also worry she is going to grow up and think I just slept all the time, but she doesn't know I was up until 3am writing a stupid paper about the things I worry about. But that's not her fault. I worry about making a good impression on the people around me because I don't want to be alone and the only people around me is family right now. I seem to piss everyone else off. Why do I piss them off? Because I am pushing people away so they can't hurt me. Is that an excuse? I worry about getting into an accident and not being able to take care of my responsibilities, but should I? I worry about being someone else's burden, I don't want to hinder someone else's life with my inability to love myself. It is no one's problem but my own. But there are people who want to help me or are they getting paid to do so because someone decided it was good for business to make money on others suffering. #cancer maybe that's too much. I definitely can't post this anywhere now. I worry about getting up in the morning and it being my last day. I worry that all of this will pile up and I'll do something I can't take back. But that's why I think of my daughter, I worry I'll be trapped in this life and these circumstances for a long time because I am too afraid to take a leap of faith and just try to make my life better. I worry about anything and everything. I don't care about anyone other than my daughter truly, her life is the only real thing I care about. She is so innocent, am I contaminating her life by being in it though? Is my negative thinking rubbing off on her and will she be like me? I hope not. I see the negative in everything. I can't think fast but when I do think at my own pace, I can figure shit out. I worry about being in a situation I can't think my way out of. I truly worry about everything. My daughter is being pushed into school. Well I think so. Her mother doesn't want her to not be in school, because she is ready. I think it's because her mom doesn't want to take care of her and wants to push her into school so someone else must deal with her. She seems too young to start preschool in my mind. Why do I care so much about what my ex-wife is doing or thinks? Maybe it is because I have to deal with her for the rest of my life, not like she is going away and I can't not talk to her because then the court will see me as being unfit to parent then I will lose my daughter. I don't want that now do I. I feel like my ex-wife has her life together and mine is falling apart underneath me but maybe she is just hiding it like I am trying to do? But I'm the one writing this so we will stick with my feelings. I don't want to lose my daughter but everything I do I am feeling like it is a movement on a chess board and at any moment I am going to get check mated. Who even uses a term like that anymore? Apparently, I do. I worry about who is going to care for my daughter when I am not around. I worry she will fall into something and I can't save her. Literally and figuratively. I worry my life is pointless then I think of her smile and watch videos of her, and it makes me happy. I worry I am a burden on people, and no one wants to deal with me, so I try to hide myself. I feel I am not good at anything. Or not good enough. I feel lonesome tired afraid and beaten down. I have to many struggles. too much on my mind. Emotionless. Defeated. Unintelligent, worthless, hopeless. Who thinks like this? I do. I have depression.",2

"(48M) I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for probably \~35 years now. I've been on pretty much all the different meds, had 2 rounds of TMS (30 sessions each), and have had therapy. Nothing has made me feel any better.

"I want to die, I want everything to stop and I want to stop my thoughts and my lungs. Every single breath hurts my body, it's like I'm struggling to breathe even though it's basic instinct. I self harm all of the time and recently I've done worse than I ever have before. My whole body aches and I'm constantly tired, I just don't have energy for life anymore. I want to kill myself and be done with it, but theres so many things I need to work out. Who will find my body? How will I do it? Will it hurt? Who should I give my belongings and pets to? Anyway, I just want someone to listen to me and to talk to me about how I really feel. Everyone always brushes me off. Nobody listens to anything I say, I feel so alone. I'm not sure if I truly want to die or if I just want to hurt myself badly enough to be hospitalised for a few weeks. I'm scared to truly die, but is it strange to want to hurt myself and be hospitalised for a while? I want to take a break from my life and be somewhere with people who understand and will take care of me. I feel like the only way I'll be able to escape is if I attempt suicide and am hospitalised, and they'll finally have to take me seriously. Is this a crazy thought? Does anyone else feel this way? I don't know what to do. I have too many emotions.",5
"i am feeling very, very bad right now. suicidal i guess. more like passively wishing i would slip into death with no effort or suffering on my part. i've suffered enough. 

i feel like right now is the first time all week my brain has had to pause and process or actually feel something and it's just aggressively hitting me with all the depression i've been stuffing down throughout the week when i didn't have time for it. well, now i do. so here it is. 

i tried journaling. i ended up just listing ways i could kill myself right now while i'm home alone. (not gonna. wish i would, or could, but i won't. not now). tried meditating. couldn't focus on it or let the calm penetrate the surface. i looked at my dog and immediately started sobbing, thinking about him living without me. 

i wanted to get some fresh air and let him run around, so i let him outside and sat on the front steps. he ended up sitting right next to me. wouldn't leave my side. i looked up and saw the moon (it was still daylight) and began crying again. my dog kept nudging me to keep a hand on him and pushing against me. it made me cry more. i talked aloud to the moon. to whatever is out there. to my late mom. begged whoever was listening to please just help me. ease the pain. do something. i do not want to do this anymore. 

sat there for a while and watched the moon move in the sky behind the bare tree branches. felt the cold air seep down to my bones. it felt good. felt good to feel something that wasn't sadness. it calmed me down. at this point i just feel numb. back to autopilot, i guess. better than life-shatteringly sad, right? 

i wish i could tell someone â€œi'm feeling suicidalâ€ and they'd drop everything to bring me chinese food and rub my back. without me saying another word. that's what i want. ridiculous, right? but instead i tell people that and then push them away. or i don't tell them at all. or i give subtle hints and they are completely ignored. 

actually, i wish the aid of other people would help me at all. i THINK having someone support me in this way or love me or kiss my wounds would fix it all, but it wouldn't. i'm just terrified of the thought of dealing with this alone for another single second. i am terrified of myself. of my brain. of my sickness. my trauma. my darkness. i want someone else to come pick up all the pieces and feed me chinese food and rub my back while they do it. 

if only.

"I'm drowning over here. I'm failing every single person in my life, being criticized by every single person in my life, being controlled by every single person in my life, and I don't know how to deal.

My abusive ex is fighting for custody of our daughter. He'll be granted overnights in a few weeks, when he's never spent more than six hours with her. She's going to be so scared. She's too young to understand why her mom isn't there. I've tried suggesting we transition slowly but he's refusing to do so unless I give him six more hours a week, ""in good faith.""

I have two weeks to pay $2k to a court appointed person, that I didn't ask for and can't get rid of, or I'll be held in contempt of court, resulting in a fine or jail time, even though I'm unemployed for another couple months. My dad is well able to help, but won't, because he ""doesn't want to get involved,"" but not because he isn't financially able.

My boyfriend is completely minimizing AND demonizing my feelings. Every single time I point out a problem, he plays victim and turns it around on me. When he picks on me and it hurts my feelings, I just need to toughen up and trust that he doesn't mean it. When I get upset that he tells me what to do, I just need to let go of this hatred for imagined authority. When he's super stressed to the point of being 85% negative all the time and I'm feeling neglected and unloved because of it, I just need to keep my feelings to myself because he doesn't need guilt on top of his stress.

My baby has been sick so she hasn't been sleeping well. She woke up at 4:30 this morning, when she normally gets up at 6:30, and I was trying to get her back down. Well I also live with my parents. And my stepdad told my mom that I was yelling at my daughter and stomping around the room to intimidate her, which isn't at all true. When I told my boyfriend that I was being stern with her, not yelling, he said that maybe I should change my stern voice because apparently it scares people. 

So yes, let me just do whatever the fuck everyone wants me to do and be who they want me to be because I have no autonomy or authority over my over damn life. Let me stop expressing my emotions, which means stop having emotions all together, to please all these fuckers in my life. Let me change something I don't even feel I'm doing *wrong* just to make someone else fucking happy.

And if I'm not happy?

Well, that's just too bad! Because apparently everyone else's feelings matter but mine.

I don't want to die, but I can't fucking live like this. Every waking moment of my life is just trying to please someone else. It's putting everyone else above me because if I don't, I'll be chastised or belittled or berated. No one can just let me be me and do what I do because they think they have some fucking hold on me and should be able to control what I do and say and think and feel.

I can't fucking LIVE like this. Who fucking can? But there's no way out. I'm unemployed until the summer. So I have to live with my parents. I have to listen to their bullshit. I can't get my ex to stop stalking me and harassing me and insulting me. The court is refusing to hold him accountable. I can't force my dad to keep me out of jail for something I have zero control over. I can't get my boyfriend to be more considerate of my feelings, but I can't break up with him either because then I'll *completely* fall apart. Those good moments with him are literally the only things keeping me functioning.

I honestly feel like if I didn't have skin, I'd be shattered. Not even just shattered, in pieces. Like a broken piece of tempered glass, split into so many pieces that they're impossible to count, and I get cut by them every single time I move. Just a walking, breathing flesh bag of blood and fragments.

And there's zero way out. I've never felt so hopeless in my life.",4

"He wrote a note and everything. Nobody knew a thing, he was so successful, athletic, smart, social. He was friends with everyone. All my boyfriend can say is how depressing the air at school is, how low everyone is, how it just hit everyone. This person took their own life. They're gone.

All I can think about is myself. How many times I've attempted it and failed. How much of an asshole I am for wanting to put that suffering onto others, and yet how much I want my death to impact people. I feel like I'm not suffering bad enough if I don't kill myself. At the same time, I'm convinced suicide is no longer even an option taken how many times I've survived.

This other kid was so strong, so brave and so powerful that he was able to leap 6 stories up to his death. He wrote an elaborate note. He kept his mouth shut about his inner turmoils and nobody knew a thing. On the other end is me, I've done nothing but fail at everything including trying to kill myself, and I feel like my only personality trait is my trauma.

"A few years ago I was depressed and suicidal for several different reasons. I thought I worked through it. I thought I was better. But I'm 22 now and for about the last year, things have been gradually getting worse. I'm at the point now where I guess I'm probably passively suicidal? I have suicidal thoughts but I have no intention on acting on it. The urges to self harm have also occasionally come back, but I haven't done anything.

I'm frustrated because nothing specifically happened to bring me back here. It just happened. I'm really struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It feels like I put all that work in for nothing, I'm almost right back where I was and why keep putting so much effort into something that's futile and I'm always just gunna end up here again.

I'm not quite at my lowest low, but I'm afraid if something doesn't change I'll get there. I guess for as long as I'm scared of being suicidal that's hope.

Idk, I feel lonely and the few people close to me wouldn't understand. I know that sounds cliche but truly none of them have had depression, and when I've tried approaching it they say something cliche and unhelpful like â€œthings will get better I promise.â€ Or â€œtry taking a walk, the sun and movement always helps meâ€ Like yeah wow thanks I never thought to do that before lol. Granted maybe it's partly my fault bc I haven't really said the full extent of it so they don't know how bad it is. But I still just don't think I'd get anything helpful from them.

i've got bad highs with long lasting side effects 
my prescriptions descriptions can be passed off as books 
i'll pass you some of them if you're truly interested
i'm a case study, just to die off and to be added as another shitty statistic 
at least i made it on a list i've been written off my whole life so i can now pat myself on the back
i finally did it! 
hip, hip ..

hip, hip, hurray! 
hip, hip, hurray!
looking up at the sky
the clouds are grey
looks like gods raining down on my parade
sucks that i didn't have enough strength to stay 
i'm just tired of the pain 
this life is exhausting and if happiness is an award
well i'll never receive it because i'm not worthy of accolades",0
"my life is worth nothing, yesterday my roommate raped me and now i'm scared of him, me and my bf broke up, it's just time to end this, if i end it now i won't feel like i have anything that i might as well finish, i have set the time, 6:30 tonight. is there any better way than a gun",1
"I get to go to school, to have an education, I never got bullied, I was born with countless blessing, so my question is why do i feel so hopelessly empty, I've been crying myself to sleep for the past year or so and I feel things getting worse but I honestly don't know what to do, I've even been thinking of suicide on the daily, but inevitably I know I won't kill myself because I don't want to burden the people around me, I feel as though I'm not living for myself anymore. I've tried reaching to a close friend of mine, and it just turned into a vent session, and we started drifting apart after that, and I feel like it was my fault, the saddest part is that I feel like I'm doomed to living a life where I'm pretending like I have everything together when I'm reality, I tripped and fell into a pit of depression, please tell me, is there hope?",5
"I can't count how many times I've tried reaching out on reddit, each time to no avail. I have no idea where else to go or what else to do. I hope someone can say something that is helpful in the slightest for once.

I can't afford to see an actual psychologist or psychiatrist. I recently discovered a place in my city that offers free counselling for certain people. After a few weeks of consideration and paranoia I finally sucked it up and went there to inquire. I almost felt proud of myself for taking that step. Then I found out there's a four month waitlist. Fuck that. I can't wait that long. I need help now.

I live in a broken, poor city with little opportunity. I can't afford to move away. I was neglected by my parents as a child and biasd as a teen. I never had a true parental figure. I have no idea what the hell I'm doing with my life. Thoughts of suicide began when I was eleven years old. I've tried to hang myself once with a belt but it broke. I have no true family aside from my grandmother. The only friends I have are long distance ones whom I met on the internet years ago and only talk to every month or so. Every romantic relationship I've been in has gone to shit by my own actions. I've developed a strong hatred for most of the people in my life as well as myself.

Overwhelming thoughts of suicide and the pain of loneliness severely hinders my ability to get anything done. I try to sit down to work on things but it just doesn't happen. I just can't. My memory has gone to shit. I can barely remember much of my childhood anymore and I probably won't remember much of what you say to me 20 minutes after you say it. My focus is non-existent. I've been having a lot of difficulty reading because I just can't focus on the words. I am currently unemployed and job-searching is horrible. My resume is pathetic. I didn't graduate high school. I hardly eat anymore and when I do it's usually cheap unhealthy food. My good habits slipped and now I hardly brush my teeth. I haven't been to the dentist in over a year but I can just feel the cavities. I lost the one thing that kept me trying to move forward. The one thing that gave me hope of a future. Now I can't see myself anywhere in the future.

There's nothing for me here. I feel so alone. Everyday I fantasize about pulling out the big chef's knife and driving it through my throat one or ten times. I just don't have the desire to go on. I know that not everyone is supposed to make it. Not everyone can make it. I genuinely feel like I am one of those people. But a small part of me still wants to live.

I don't know if anyone will see this or care enough to respond. If you do respond, please just don't say generic copy-pasted shit. Believe me, I've heard it all.",2
I don't know why I am so fucked up but I never feel like I can trust my parents word. My siblings are completely self successful and on their straight path to be coming everything the world wants them to be but me? I'm stuck in reverse. Sitting at home too anxious or exhausted to even shower or brush my teeth. My parents tell me they love me and they don't care how long it takes me to succeed but I don't believe them. I want to... but a part of me will always never believe them.,4
"I had a patient who was unconscious due to a large spontaneous brain hemorrhage. I remember just gazing at their face and thinking, they don't feel anything. Nothing can hurt them or make them feel sad. Part of me wondered whether it would just be better if they didn't wake up at all and I realized that I must be very sad at the moment to think in such a way. Of course I want them to wake up, be well again, and for the medical team to strive to save their life. I'm just really in a sad place right now.",3

"Im a freshman in college. I feel terrible writing about all my problems on an online forum, but I've gotten to this point in my life where I just feel stuck and I feel like I can't confide in my friends or family. I feel sad all the time. I don't like myself and I don't think I ever will, but what gets me to care about myself the most is when people show they care about me because it reminds me of what makes me happy. 

But lately I just feel like a burden to everyone. I recently told my close (best?) friend at college that I hate myself and that sometimes, even though I would never do anything to myself, I feel like there's no point in me being here. She told me that she doesn't want to hear stuff like that and that she's going to distance herself because that made her worry about me all the time. And I understand and that I should be going to see a counselor but it just hurts. Because yea if my friend told me that I would worry but I also wouldn't push them away because I would understand that they just need someone. 

It hurts that I put my whole heart into all my relationships and that I would do anything for the people I care about and to lift them up but at this point it feels like they wouldn't do the same and I just feel alone. I feel like everyone is fed up with me and that I'm just sad and there's so many things missing from my life and I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know why I try so hard to be this amazing friend and person to everyone around me and it gets me nowhere. I want to fix it but I don't know how and now I'm just left feeling absolutely alone and with no one else to turn to. I just don't know what to do",5
"we worked together for like 8 months so we knew each other prior. went on like 5 dates, saw each other a few times outside of that. i left $20 in her apartment because i didn't want to wake her up and ask if it was hers, and gave her my hoodie at her work because she was cold

"I'll try to be as transparent as possible without revealing too much. I am a high school senior, about to graduate in \~3 months. It feels like my life has been defined by the pressure to get good grades; and while I have done decently well in that regard, it has come at the expense at my social life and a lot of other things I value. I used to love the sport I played; now it feels like a burden to even show up to practice. I feel the same way about the other extracurricular activities I'm involved in. I've been rejected to several colleges/programs already, some of which I thought I had a decent shot at getting into. Occasionally, I have what I think are real suicidal impulses, but I know that I'm too much of a fucking pussy to do anything about it. The closer and closer I get to graduation, the lower my work ethic stoops, and the worse I feel about the utterly pathetic excuse of a human being that I now am. The reason why I'm confused is because occasionally, I have moments where I enjoy myself. Where I enjoy life. It feels like I'm bobbling on a line between despair and hope and I'm not sure whether that makes me truly depressed/suicidal.",2

"Please be mindful when commenting on posts. This applies to me, maybe it applies to others, maybe it doesn't.

I'm not here looking for someone to fix my problems. It wouldn't be possible. It would take a novel to give all of the context, the background, the struggles, the attempts, the life. I'm here for comfort. To know that I'm not alone. To be able to express my anguish in whatever means I choose without fear of judgment and negativity. It is not helpful to trivialize my problems. I understand that we all want to solve these issues. That we don't want to see others suffering. Giving solutions to problems you do not understand is not helpful. Giving advice to someone that does not ask for it is not helpful. My problems will not be solved by a paragraph comment. However, I find comfort in knowing that I'm not alone. That comfort helps me cope, helps me push on, helps me make it through another day. That's why I am here. I really appreciate this place. Thanks for allowing me to share.",0

I tell her that it's okay to hurt me I can handle it.

"I hate always being reminded our lives are going to school, getting an education, hopefully get a good paying job and pay taxes. I know there are other stuff, Marriage or whatever. But as another year passes, I feel the years flying. I remember being in elementary telling my self in recess, â€œwow, I'm never getting to high school.â€ Here I am, I was a positive child and adults had hope for me. It's sad to see depression hold me down. If I need to be happy I need to change something. I hate taking meds and being on a schedule. People are gonna treat me different if they find out. My dumb arrogant self also lashed out at my girl best friend. I think she hates me. I said sorry like a million times, I wrote paragraphs to get her to forgive me. She recently came up front and told me she was feeling suicidal recently, and me getting mad at her just made it worst. I'm trying to fix it as best as I can. She said if she can get a hug but she still won't talk to me in class, hallways, or over text. Her reason is she doesn't like getting personal. And she's told me in the past she's had family problems, so I know she's stressed. I don't know if I'm annoying her but I'm keeping positive vibes. Just today one of my â€œfriendsâ€ with ADHD said his friend was gonna give him a gun and shoot two teachers. I trust one of my gym teachers the most in the school, more than my family. I mean the guys gone through it. I had him for class a year ago, and in that same year he was divorced. He knows depression and stress. Anyways I told him and he thanked me a bunch. I think he's speculated I have depression, he's a health teacher and I always talk to him so I know he knows somethings off. He sent me to the VP and told him the story. They both basically hailed me for keeping the school safe. And I'm grateful. I like being reminded people care for me, I just don't see it. And neither do you probably. Think of an old teacher or friend you always talked too, I'm betting they're missing you right now. 


Alright I know I wrote a lot but it just kind of blurted out, I knew I had some stuff going on, but now I've wrote it out I see the bigger picture of my self. I'm sorry if I'm not making sense, it doesn't to me either.

I love you all,

I have no money and due to my autism and physical disability's I can't work. I feel stuck and for the first time in years I legitimately want to end my life. I see no way out. I was foolish to believe anyone would help me.

"I think this could be it. I'm really just not able to grasp this world. This is not where I want to be. 

People are just so fucked. It doesn't matter where they come from, what they do, or even really how they act. There is just an insufferable defect in humanity's existence. I am 100% for an extinction event. I'm no longer in a panic about climate change or anything like that, I want it to accelerate. I don't want to be here when shit hits the fan, but I want it to happen. I am now certain that we are incapable of a better future where these defects do not exist. The same story keeps playing out over and over again, the only difference is now it is playing out on smart phones. People are just fucked. 

People call me a failure and I laugh. The tragedy is that there is no glory in this world. You could win a million bucks in the stock market and you are still going down with the rest of us. We see the way that the most powerful people in the world act every day. Some idiot decided to give them all Twitter accounts. Oh my gosh, what a riot. It has got to the point where the weak are still the weak and the strong just look dumber than everyone else. 

Obviously this is not the kind of attitude that anyone would want to put up with so I should leave to avoid pissing anyone else off even though I am absolutely right. I like to tell myself that having a better attitude means accepting a wrong position for the sake of getting along with everyone else walking off the cliff. Well there are two options, I can be right and go crazy stranded alone outside the herd or I can be wrong and feel good about myself because I have people walking into the abyss with me. What a stupid, stupid fate. Well there is a third option, I could kill myself. 

I don't even want to hear some people have it worse. I'm sorry but hearing about 6 billion people who have it worse doesn't brighten my day. Try harder, try again. You're not going to make me feel any better by reminding me my country, my tax dollars contribute significantly to their peril by bombing many of those people into ruins for the sake of politicians and bureaucrats who have literally become Twitter trolls. It's not funny, I mean it. 

I want to kill myself. I have had it in my mind for a long time but there was something spiritually holding me here. I wonder if that has passed. I don't see anymore goal posts. I'm begging desperately for a sign because as much as I want it to stop I'm a coward who fears death. But the pressure comes sometimes so hard, so intense that I'm not thinking about fear or any of that. Those are the moments where I know it might happen. 

This post may get deleted for inciting activism but for me personally I do not care what you do or what your social positions are. We are all collectively collapsing, so I don't care who you vote for or what you believe. These are just the thoughts driving me toward 5 and inevitably perhaps death. I'm not even looking forward to a girlfriend anymore. I can only imagine waking up every day and telling her we are all doomed, or better yet lying to her face and saying everything is alright.

It's almost time to go.",1
"Ive been going pretty good for some time. 
Got a flat, got a job, stayed clean for an almost year (except cigs and beers why I try limit as much as i can). 
I even had established morning routine before job like exercising and meditations. I were even writing daily journal which helped me a lot with memory and thinking. Exercising proved to be excelent whenever my attention started to go jumpy. I was going to sleep at exact time and woke a exact time same. It wasnt exactly perfect but it was better then before. 


And then i dont know what happened. Guess its the freaking weather and loneliness along with overthinking that got me back into this moodiness. 
I guess I kind off hoped my father and mother would be freaking proud of me to stop dragging people into the same hole i was in and using. 
that they would be proud i found the job and keep it , that i try even through i have health complications. But none of it happened. They each have their own families and im just a waste with no one to talk to except for my therapist and girlfriend. And I dont even know how to grateful to at least have someone since they dont understand how I am feeling. 
I just sit home trying to live someones else life inside comics and playing the same game over and over again even through i hate it. Trying to find a way to get away with assisted suicide because I cant do a shit right. 
Most depressing thing I realized is that it doesnt really matter how much i try to change myself. People instenctively hate me. That it doesnt matter if i try to live ""normal"" life. it still sucks. It doesnt matter if am clean or not , since no one cares. Everywhere i go theres this black cloud of my negativity transfering my bad ""mojo"" onto other people. Im burden to my gf since im most of the last month only sad piece of shit that cant do nothing to make this life better. Im burden even to her friends who took a pity on my cause im depressed shit. 
It doesnt even matter if i would die. No one cares a one piece of shit. All gonna be friends till I had money and drugs , they called adn talked about their problems , but now when im down theres no one. 
Im just waiting till dignitas answer me with mail so I can start preparing to leave this shitty hole called reality. 
Ive been trough so much.. Be it Abusive childhood, Abusive ex, Depressions since I was 11, Bullying, Drug addiction , anxieties, agoraphobia, so called ""desilusions"", Fake friends who destroyed any bit of my ability to trust a different human being, Being forced by a girl to almost having sex when i was 6, Constant Isolations ,School failures, being scapegoated, being hospitalised , tried to kill myself 3 times, Being left on my own my whole life with no support from my so called parents who just made everything worse. I cant get over it. 
I keep hearing all those bullshits like ""just change your thinking man"". How the heck am i supposed to change something that has been hardwired into my head for years when i was still a child. 


Id love to make comics, Id love to make music but i cant do anything else except for reading and playing over and over again , cause i have no energy to do anything. Worst part is I can hear laughing all the people I know. And even worse part is I know no one will answer this post again , cause theres just no other way than to ends this miserable piece of shit thats called my life. 
I hate all those people who think Assisted-suicide/Euthanasia shouldnt be avaible to people with mental illness. It is like saying ""people with cancer doesnt deserve to die a calm way."" 


All my life i was trying to be better.. To help people around me.. And it cost me dearly. 
It really brought me down when I realized it doesnt matter. It doesnt matter i tried to save my mom from alcoholic, It just made things worse for me. It doesnt matter I tried to cheer people [up.It](https://up.It) doesnt matter Im clean. I dont know how to form this sentence , so ill just say it doesnt matter how hard I try. It always come back and i have to start again. But im tired of reabulding and rebuilding again and again.

"So to put the question into context so everyone can understand where I'm coming from. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for years, really fucked up childhood but some better took me in when I was a preteen so that helped but I still feel everything. Now I've been to therapy a couple times and they helped but that was when my insurance covered it now it doesn't so I don't have a therapist. I'm debating on getting onto some meds and seeing a psychiatrist. Anyways point is can I date if I'm making steps to get better? I'm a 21 ginger virgin male with lots of insecurities and depression doesn't help. In fact I'm worried I have bi polar disorder because my symptoms fall into that category more so than MDD. My point is I constantly feel like any woman can and should do better than me. I have this crippling feeling every time I like a girl I think ""just stop, they can do better leave her alone"" literally ALL my friends are in relationships and I want it so bad. I want what they have but I have little to no experience, the one ego boost I have is I was once told I was the best kisser she's ever met and she been around the block a couple times. I'll be honest I miss her to, she was someone I would've been willing to lose the V to and risk the rejection because she was so nice and one of the most non judgmental people I've ever met and she was a nerd to lol. She moved States for school so our fun was cut short. Should I try to date? It's really hard for me since I've never been in love and don't know what to look for.

"*I apologize in advance for any terms i use which may not be common to most readers* 
I was once proud of this and now i see it as a neutral thing, but i joined the army. at first i loved the comeraderie, pt, rucks, etc. and basic was a lot of fun with the grenades, obstacle courses, etc. but now im an academic fail out from AIT (job training in the army). its really painful living as a holdover. for those who are thinking ""wtf is a holdover?"": a holdover is someone who for whatever reason failed from their training, got injured, or in at least moderately serious trouble. the job of a holdover is mostly sitting on bleachers all day near the drill sergeants officespace until the end of the workday. they will sometimes clean or perform some paper work on occasion. i contribute nothing, do nothing, and all the while watching my old friends earn the exact position that i spent the last several months of working my heart out for. im not angry at them, so much as i am just really... frustrated. because of my jobs academic difficulty, this is really not uncommon but ive been stuck here as a holdover for over a month now. 9 hours per day, 5 days per week, of sitting and doing next to nothing. i feel like a drain on society while also miserable with the ""work"" i am doing. 

i used to think that i wasnt contributing to anything while training but was fine with it because my job was to learn to be a soldier. but now i have no job, no purpose, and none of the old freedoms i had as a civilian as a consolation. i still have to abide by the ""battle buddy"" system in which soldiers in basic and AIT cannot ever be without another soldier around except for very specific circumstances. i am not allowed off base (which is less than 2 square miles of space). and i cannot have things like electronics during the time in which im ""working"" to pass the time. this has all made me thoroughly reexamine my reasons for every decision ive ever made.

at first when i failed out i knew id be sent to a new MOS (army job). id hoped for armor (tank stuff), artillery, infantry, or really just anything except for signals (computers, which frustrate me to my wits end), medical (im afraid of needles), and transport (i hate working on cars). and the drill sergeant said the best case scenario, id be sent off to be an IT specialist. i was nothing short of devastated. 

Just one month ago, i was what youd think of when you thought of a bubbly, outgoing, and motivated soldier. Today i realized i had an issue when a drill sgt that i very much look up to came back after being gone for a few months and she noticed that i was showing signs of being ""off"" before i even really said anything. 

I used to be really great at pt, and now im doing so poorly that i may get kicked out of the army entirely. im stressed, saddened by my prospects, and overall just ashamed of where i am. if it werent for my gf whose been nothing short of incredible, there is no way i would have ever made it this far. but now it feels like in the process of joining the army, i started walking from new york to california, i was getting close to nevada until i tripped, got knocked the fuck out, and woke up in ohio. and now im just staring at the map thinking how itd be so much easier to just turn back and cut my losses.

thank you for putting up with my long rant reddit,

"Everyday I could be fine but eventually the thought of my death creeps in to my thought and it makes me sad. I have been questioning what is on the other side all my life and sometimes I just think I should kill myself to get it over with. My friends don't help either most of the are sorta surface level and the ones closest to me are the most negative. I just want to have fun in life I'm only 16 why do I think about it so much ?

I don't even care to experience homeschool anymore
I am just trying to go to college.",2
"I battle with depression and tried to kill myself 2 weeks back, I chickened out just before I passed out and called a friend for help. Does that surreal feeling ever go away? How do you get your life back? I don't want to fall back into old habits as that's how I got to the darkest place I have ever been... But it's so damn hard! I am on meds and they seem to be helping but honestly I feel like I am staring at a black wall with no hope of escape!",1

"Can somebody on this sub go back in time, and stop me from making the decision to ""focus on my happiness""? Last year (2 days before my 25th birthday) I made this decision, and I fucking regret it. I'm realizing how hopeless my situation is, and I have the energy and motivation to throw myself off of a cliff now. I decided that I'm going to kill myself before I turn 30 unless things change. There's no way that I can live life so isolated, and trapped in my own head.

I just feel completely alone and I'm just pissed off I can't find it in myslef to just fucking do what I want to do already. I want this shit to stop.",4
It's finals time in school. I've been more stressed out then usual and my meds don't seem to work. Last night it just got to much to handle and I cut myself it felt good during the moment but now I feel terrible. I was doing so good I was almost a year cut free. I'm worried that my parents might mind out now and I'll have to have a talk with them. Why did I make such a stupid decision I hate myself for this.,2
"It's been a hard couple months. 

To break it down in a simpler manner; 
I'm a General Manager at a restaurant, working ~65 hours per week. My husband is 29 years old, diagnosed with Crohns about seven years ago. He has been unable to work for roughly 2 years. About a year and a half ago, he had a surgery that required removing roughly 6 feet of his intestines. Due to us not having health insurance until recently, hes been unable to do follow up appointments or get onto much needed medication to manage his disease. His Crohns is getting worse. We finally got him into the doctor's in January when we got health insurance. They've done several CT scans, and keep finding more and more abcesses developing in his intestines. He has another surgery scheduled for this upcoming Tuesday, but he had to go into the hospital again today, due to an abscess that is bulging out of his stomach. I have two puppies at home. With my husband being in the hospital, and myself working ridiculous hours, it puts a lot more on my plate than I have already with work. I feel like a narcissistic POS wife, because while my poor husband is in the hospital, I'm more worried about how much more stress has been put on me. 
I've been through a lot of trauma in my life. A physically abusive father growing up really messed with me, and I'm just now realizing the impact it's had on my every day life. I was in a 4 year relationship with a man who cheated on me the entire time we were together. He biasd me physically, verbally and sexually. Manipulated me, and really mentally screwed me over. I was the one paying our bills (on $13 an hour) while he sat at home for 4 years doing absolutely nothing. 
I've been through a lot like I said. Most of these situations I have put myself in. 
I'm constantly tired, unmotivated, and angry. All the time. I've reached a point where I just want to give up. I feel like I'm in a neverending cycle of problems. I fix one thing, and three more bad things get thrown at me. I'm working my ass off every day, plus some, and I have nothing to show for it, since we are so far into medical sent that we are scrounging for money. I'm 25 years old and I feel like I'm 50. I've had several panic attacks over the past couple months, many if which have happened multiple times per day. Anytime I go to the doctor for my anxiety/depression/ADD, they throw whatever meds they can pull out of their ass at me, and tell me to come back a couple months later. I have tried several medications and none of them seem to do anything for me except zombify me. I've tried journaling, I have tried exercising regularly, i have tried everything i feel like!!! I dont know what else to do. My friends are no longer existant, and I dont have anyone to talk to. Figured I'd come to this sub and vent, because I really dont have anyone else.",2
"I have run into 2 major problems in my life atm, it has been eating away at me for the better part of a month. I'll give you some backstory:

I have people pleaser all my life. I feel like I have always gone with the flow, with people's expectations of me rather than have my own. I have done that since I was a kid and I'm now turning 20 this year, And with that being said the first problem I have run into is, I don't know what I want and like partly due to the depression. But mostly due to the fact that I've never really done or said what I wanted to to outside forces shutting me down at every turn (school, parents etc.). Idk and it's driving me up a wall.


2: I thought hard about the people pleaser trait in my being a lot and I have come to this conclusion, I hate who I am. I believe that I am selfish and feel because I haven't done what I have wanted in my life I am inauthentic. So I go and look for outside validation and love because I feel like I am incapable of it. But when I receive it, and it doesn't hit the way I wanted it to or things are too fast or far. Like a addict I dump them and look for a new person to give me that feeling I long for. It's fucked up, because the other people care about me and I do to to an extent, but I prioritize my own feelings and shit first. And that realization fucked me up so bad. Real bad. 


Any thoughts would be great because I'm so lost rn. Thanks",2
"I am not sure if this is allowed so take down if it isn't, but has anyone tried essential oils for their depression/anxiety? If so, has it worked for you? I do not respond to therapy or meds so I am running out of options for managing all of it.",0
"These days I just feel like running around in circles. I keep making the wrong decisions, all of which coming from my inability to control my emotions. I am currently facing the consequences of my decisions and of course, am very tired as I could not see any way for me to feel accomplished. Additionally, I have imposed problems upon others, including my loved ones. It all began so well. I was in this perfect mint condition of being an average student from a prestigious high school in my country. The school's full of brilliant kids I can't seem to catch up with, and once I feel exhausted to keep on competing with them academically for scholarships, I stopped trying. My mom was having a perfectly stable job, earning an equivalent of 500 USD each month. Yet, the toxic environmental conditions of the city we lived in back then made me feel really oppressed, not to mention I was absurdly overwhelmed by the isolated feeling the school gave me. 

That was when I decided to stupidly leave my country for another place that seemed more ideal - a country in Europe, with inarguably better climate (because I love cold weather), better food quality, generally peaceful urban life in contrast to the busy city ruled by crazy drivers. It felt great for the first few days of arrival and my head was temporarily free from all the pressure, but all magic comes with a price. 

Basic things in life such as water are ridiculously expensive here - it's stressful to think about it in the shower. Additionally, I've moved to a new school. What made me so reluctant about it was the fact that it's an international school: small but sweet community, but with tuition fees that have considerably stressed my mom out. The prices are equivalent of what my mother made in her old job in 2 years. Life was good until Coronavirus struck. Apparently, healthcare in Europe is downright FRUSTRATING. (sorry European friends) Few countries took the quarantine procedure seriously, and the country I'm living in now isn't one of them. I want to go back...

Days went by and I discovered that lots of kids in my old school are currently achieving something. Something that I once considered to be my dream, but had given up on it just because.....emotions. 

Ughh I don't know anymore... I'm so stressed atm I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.

I have cut a few slashes to my arm once, though not noticeable, and very much want to do the same again. I have so much to think about. I feel guilty for putting someone like my mom to go through things so I could get what I wanted.

Dear Hell, please give me the strongest torture device for I deserve it.",2
"I am 28, no friends, no close relatives, no girl, no skills, still living with parents and my brother, no dreams, no nothing, not a single will to live.

Last January I almost drowned swimming in the ocean and while drowning, I realized it's okay it's gonna be over but I was rescued. So I tried to live these months to see if I can. But I do not if I can anymore. I need to stop pretending that it's all gonna be ok.

Yeah. So I have no future really. Why live.",4

It's so hard just to get out of bed every morning. Right now I just want to die. It's too damn hard just to be alive in this world. I don't want to keep going. I don't want to keep fighting. I just wish it would all end and I could have peace. All I ever asked for out of life was for love. All I ever wanted was love. This world took that request and turned it back on me in the form of a million daggers to the heart. I can't bear it any more. I want to die.,4

"I know. This makes me sound like a HORRIBLE PERSON. I meant to send the text to my brother about my friend but I checked the sender (after I got all my aggression and sadness/anger/frustration out through text) and it turns out the recipient wasn't my brother...it was my friend. I feel like my world is going to end. I quickly deleted it all as fast as I could, but she had still seen it all...or most of it, and that is enough. Me and this girl have been friend for my whole life. I am 16 and she is 17. As soon as I realized that I made a huge mistake, I started shaking frantically and my heart almost beat out of my chest. The more I look at this situation, the less my friend is in the wrong, and the more I am in the wrong. After this incident happened with me frantically typing away and sending horrible texts about her in front of her face, I couldn't even say anything. I was mortified. I I sent the texts (it turned out she had already seen them at this point) and simply walked away. I didn't know what to say. I seriously just took out all of my aggression on one of my best friends, over text, in front of her. And won't get into what the texts said too much, but basically they were saying: â€œ she always thinks she's better than me, and always makes me feel badâ€ and so forth. And guess what...I started the whole schpiel off by typing: â€œ *blank* is so annoying. I got so scared and angry at myself afterwards that I threw up in the bathroom and cut my wrist. I deserved it. I went home early , to filled with guilt and too ashamed to continue on throughout the day, and now here I lye, writing this on reddit in my bed, hoping someone could share some advice. Also, I already tried messaging her saying, : â€œI know you saw what I sent you...and I'm so sorryâ€ and so forth. In these texts of me apologizing, I wrote how some of the things i said about her were true, and tht I was really sad latley and depressed(I never talk about things like this with her, EVER because I've seen how she handles those types of situations....she simply cuts people off if they are feeling suicidal or sad. I feel awful and I wish I could turn back time to not send those texts, because now I fear I've lost my longest best friend for good, only at the age of 16. Please, somebody help me.",4
"I ADORE dogs. I love them more than humans, but I'm not the type of person who goes crazy whenever they see a ""cute little dog"". Actually I don't really lay a single hand on random dogs I come across to show them love. I just love their personality, and their loyalty. Almost at levels that it brings tears to my eyes even when I just think about their pure loyalty. 

Having a dog friend would help with my depression vastly, and the thought of it brings a smile to my face... Until I think of their eventual deaths. The fact that they won't be able to live long enough, and the fact that I knowingly make a close friend whose death will wreck me keep me away from this thought.

"I don't really know what to right tbh

I'm a 15 year old trans guy, came out when I was like 11 and waited on the Tavistock (the uk gender clinic) for like 3 years and then once I got there they distarged me cos I don't have any fucking friends anymore and my step dad was being a prick so that apparently means I don't know shit about myself, we literally only had like idk 3 meetings. I had been waiting so fucking long for this. I feel so fucking dysphoric all the fucking time I hate my body so fucking much. I just want enough testosterone to at least make my voice a little deeper. And what's pushed me to the edge is when I went out yesterday literally 5 people called me a girl and my mum and step dad have pretty much given up on calling me a boy and by my pronouns, they always call me a girl/thier daughter and use she/her. And even if I do get to transition this society is so fucking transphobic like just on fucking twitter or some shit and on every post to do with trans folks it's always so negative like there's a whole wave of even cis lgbt ppl hating us. Literally what's the fucking point. I've already attempted suicide over this when I was 12 and camhs did absolutely nothing, no therapist or anything. I have not a single friend except for like one online friend and literally every family member that was like â€˜oooh you tried to kill yourself this is so sad' has hardly spoken to me since plus I haven't even met half of my family and my biological dad hardly ever speaks to and keeps on arranging times for us to meet them cancelling like the only person that might actually be upset about me dying is my cat.

Anyway, I already have 2 codomsl pills with me right now and according to google I only need like 5 in one go to kill myself and there's probably way more in the house so yeah can't be arsed with life and I have literally ~nothing~ to live for so, goodbye",1

"i dont even know where to start, i am 14 and have struggeled with suicidal thoughts for a few years and recently it has gotten way worse and life has just been crap, the first trash that has happened is school, everyone i know says im so smart and should easily get good grades but i got behind on some of my schoolwork at the beggining of the year and now it snowballed up to here(i have all f's and d's in school now) and i cant fix where it is at now because its soo much, then 2 of my 3 aunts and my uncle all disowned and left the family. The girl i have liked since we met 3 years ago likes, and is in a relationship with one of my best and oldest friends i think they were togeather for about a year, then she ditched everyone she knows. so a while ago when my parents thought i was caught up with school they looked at my grades and discovered that i had horrible grades and as they were digging into me i told them i was suicidal and then the talk to me how i need to stay for them and shouldnt want to die. so they sign my up for a therapist wich i talk to twice which after that they stop taking me and just canceled and there are a few hobbies that bring my joy now and they are Piano, filmmaking, prop making, lightsaber fighting, costume making and cosplay, and video games. and so far my piano broke so i cant play that, they didnt sign me up for another semester of filmmaking cus they were too lazy, prop making is becoming un enjoyable, both of my 2 sabers broke, costume making is becoming to frustriating and hard, they say im too old for costumes and that i need to grow up and video games just arent enjoyable anymore. and as im typing this my parents think i got my grades back up to like b-'s and i didnt and now they want to check my grades just to see how im doing (they are still horrible) and i just want to die at this point, i feel like i have nothing left. i dont know what to do. and i know there are people who have it worse than me and are happy and i may just like an overprivlaged child going through a phase, but i dont really see any way out what do i do now.",2

"For the longest time, I couldn't see myself living past 25. This mostly came about towards the last year of University and got worse around the end of 2017, when I wasn't landing work. 

In 2018, I met someone and suddenly I felt alive again. I felt calm and collected. Although I was stuck in the same loop of applying for work, it didn't feel as tiresome. In 2019, I got accepted into medicine and moved overseas. My partner starts tearing us apart 3 weeks into my move... I drop out of med school because the stresses from the break up became way too much to handle. Especially since I was overseas.

Now I am back to applying for jobs in my old degree and getting nowhere. I am heavily depressed. I can't see myself past 25 again. I have this strong feeling I will die this year.

I thought I needed friends so I went out and talked to people. Nobody wants to hangout with me after school or work. I tried. My life is just pathetic no matter what I do and yes I never hang out with my so called friends.

"I have spent the past three days typing up a suicide letter, and as I near the end of it I find myself growing anxiety riddled and realizing how many people care enough about me in life that I felt the need to give an explanation to personally. 

So then I went back through and added a section for if I didn't die by suicide, because part of me just doesn't want to go through with it anymore after writing it, which I am pretty sure isn't the point of a suicide letter but I care about them so much that I don't want to imagine their faces when they read it. 

Everything has just been so hard recently, and I'm really tired both physically and emotionally. I am tired of all the losses, I am tired of classes, I am tired of the way some of my relationships are headed... I just want to rest and stop feeling so overwhelmed. I want to be there for my friends who are also struggling, one in particular who has been there for me more then anyone in my entire life and is potentially going through a similar problem as my own, but they haven't been answering my text messages and I can only assume it's because they don't want to bother me. Now that I think about it, I never want to bother them either, which is why I bottle everything up. I wish society didn't teach us that there are such things as â€œnegativeâ€ emotions that need to be locked away from other people's views. If we could all be honest with each other without feeling it's a burden on those we love I wonder how many lives could be saved and how many deep conversations could be had with our loved ones. 

I just feel bad because if anything I just feel like I'm in the way of everyone else's progress and just adding another problem on their mountain of problems. Everyone deserves better then me and I wish there was a way to get myself out the way that wouldn't potentially hurt them more then I already am.",1
"My dad is an immigrant and came the US in his 30's after he married my 18 year old mother who was studying abroad in his home country.

He quickly became financially successful and moderately famous in his industry. Things that came to define him above anything else.

My parents had me 11 years into their marriage and I have no siblings. 

I was homeschooled for most of my childhood and super sheltered from everything in life. Never allowed to have sleepovers, rarely allowed to have friends over, had every moment of my life scheduled and micromanaged. I was never encouraged to pursue anything except becoming a professional soccer player (which was never what I wanted to do, but something my dad wanted me to do as a way to live out his dreams through me vicariously.) 

He was never around. He financially supported me and my mom and lived in the same city as us most of the time, but was never there to parent me and was rarely even around on holidays or birthdays. He kept his things at our house, but came home maybe once a month, sometimes less. He always said he needed to be closer to work so he was staying at his friend's house (everything in the whole city is a 30 minute drive or less, and he never worked for anyone but himself.) 

Now that I'm an adult, I understand he was living with various girlfriends though he was still married to my mom, and she always seemed to be waiting up for him to come home and finally be a dad/husband. 

I developed severe anorexia at 12, and my family seemed to ignore it even though I stopped growing, lost 40 pounds, was rarely eating, and was exercising 4-6 hours a day. When I was literally weeks away from death with a BMI of &lt;12, my mom finally took me to a doctor after my grandma begged her to because â€œsomething was really wrong with me.â€ The doctor told her I was anorexic and recommended in-patient treatment and psychotherapy. My mom yelled at the doctor, said â€œthere's no way MY daughter is anorexic,â€ and stormed out of the office. 

For the next 6 months or so, I stayed at the same weight and, nightly, would sit down at the dinner table with my mom and cry for hours while she screamed at me to finish my food. I never went to therapy for the eating disorder and she denied every doctor who told her I was mentally ill. She was SURE I had tapeworms, a thyroid disease, celiac, or some other ailment that had caused me to lose 40% of my body weight. I stayed at a dangerously low weight until I was 16, which is the first year I went to school, and traded my ED for nightly sneaking out, binge drinking, and bulimia. 

When I was 16, I was almost arrested for trying to buy alcohol, and my dad found out and told me if I wanted alcohol I could just ask him. He started helping me sneak out and giving me alcohol whenever I wanted. I think he did this to drive a wedge between my mom and me, he always loved to have secrets that we would keep from her. He would take me around his 23 year old girlfriend and tell me to not tell my mom. In fact, he would blackmail me, saying things like â€œdon't tell mom about so and so, you would hate for her to find out about you sneaking out and partying right?â€ 

When I was 17, my dad lost all his businesses and wealth, and has still been unable to recover from the financial loss. He pinned all his happiness on money, and once it was gone he changed completely. Every time I've talked to him since then, all he's talked about is how broke he is and how my mom caused his financial ruin and what a stupid idiot she is. He curses my mom around me almost every time he talks to me.

He had a long talk with me one night when I was 16. He told me that I should never have kids because they'll ruin my life. He never wanted kids. He would be a multi millionaire and so happy and free if he had never had a family. My mom is a crazy lunatic and has only ruined his life and finances. 

I fell into a horribly abusive, 4 year relationship with a guy when I was 17. I bounced around from college to vocational school, and also had a moderately successful entertainment career. I've never been able to find footing anywhere. I feel like I can't connect with anyone. I really don't feel passion for anything and don't feel like there's any path in life that I want to take, though I do feel like I'm talented in multiple things. I'm awful at romantic relationships and friendships (maybe because I never had a healthy relationship example from my family, and never had long term friendships when I was growing up?) 

About a year ago, I was talking with my dad about how I wanted to get a job that made a lot of money like bottle service. He suggested I become a stripper. And so I did. I danced for a year, and he insisted I call him and tell him how much money I made every night, and he acted like I was so lucky because he â€œgave me permissionâ€ to do this. Like wtf I'm a grown adult who's been living on my own since 18, and god knows I was putting in the work all on my own for all the money I made. 

Every time I see him he's so negative and toxic and I realize now that a lot of the anxiety and problems I felt as a child (I've been suicidal literally since I can remember) stemmed from the insane toxic energy that always engulfed my family life. 

I've done a lot of psychedelics, and I really do have a good grip on spirituality and mindfulness, and know there's something way bigger than this earth plane we live on. There are light forces and dark forces. The thing is, lately, I just don't feel like I am meant to be blessed by the light forces. Like I was born out of darkness from a cursed family, and I am doomed to be miserable, depressed, and toxic just like my dad. He is not a good person. I think he's a narcissistic sociopath and it scares me that half of my genes come from that. 

His dad was a total narcissist, no respect for women, I felt unexplainably awful vibes from him always. My paternal grandfather had a very successful business when he was younger, but somehow that all dissolved and he ended up completely broke with nothing to leave to his family, dementia, and a mindset that his children should take care of him (which they did, until his death last year.) My aunt put herself through unspeakable stress and pain to take care of my grandfather, who was completely ungrateful for it. 

Most of my dad's family has ended up in a mental hospital by 70, and they're all completely depressed or mentally ill, and I feel the same demons taking me under every day. I've felt dark forces around me since I can remember. I've seen my demons during nightmares and sleep paralysis. I think my abusive ex-boyfriend was influenced by the demons that follow me around. 

I can't see anything good happening in my life long term. I fear I'm going to end up like everyone on my dad's side. I recently talked about a lot of this stuff with my mom and she started crying and said she's failed me in every way, she should've left my dad when I was little, and she wishes she never even married him because she was a teenager and literally only knew him for a few months before they got married. That hit so hard, because it just made me feel like my whole life was never even supposed to happen. I was just part of one giant fucked up mistake made by a naive 18 year old. 

I feel like I'm a lost soul, I wasn't meant to exist, and because of that the dark energy got ahold of me. 

I don't want to talk to my dad anymore. Am I wrong? I am questioning everything and I really hope I don't live that long because I don't see anyone in that family having any glimmer of a nice life over age 55. 

No one takes me seriously when I say my childhood fucked me up so much, because I grew up with a lot of material possessions, money, and a seemingly super involved mother. When people think of bad childhoods, they think of poverty, physical bias, druggie parents, things like that. Maybe I'm a spoiled brat. But either way I'm just not happy, I can't remember ever, ever being happy for more than a couple days at a time. What's wrong with me?",4
"I have no real life friends, I sometimes talk to people during school about mutual subjects but never get called up after school or on the weekends. I have decent grades and I live comfortably but no one likes me. I try to be approachable I try to be nice it's always the â€œshut up I didn't askâ€ or â€œgo away, no one wants you here,â€ I'm going to a therapist this Friday but I'm tired of living in a constant state of loneliness and isolation. I've begun to slit my area of my arm from my shoulder to the elbow. I don't want people to see or know that I'm in pain. Everyday I go to school with a smile on my face. I come home and cry. No one likes me. I have nothing. I am worthless. 

I don't know what I was hoping to accomplish by saying this but hey, that's my story. ðŸ˜•",5
"I found this link where I think there is someone who ""maybe"" wants to kill himself or do something in 4 hours.

The link was under the videos HYSTERIA CHALLENGE .. I leave it in the comments.",0
"I am a weak and small person that know one respects. I am treated like shit and abandon by society. I am aggressive to people. I think about murdering and killing others. I take out rage on myself and pretend to slaughter the people that constantly disrespect and hurt me. I like the grey sky that gives the depressing tone. I like gore and violence and doing things that I find somewhat happiness towards but I fall into this void of grief and sorrow. I am a hopeless one. I am loading the bullet and not caring for what anyone thinks. I don't care for life anymore. I am accepting my fate. I am glad that I am choosing to kill myself because it gives my a mature understanding of the cold and brutal reality of the human race. I don't go to counselors or therapists. I like being this way. Cold and sad makes me feel happy. I have lost interest in friends, activities and prefer to be alone. I am a sad and pathetic human being and wanted to say goodbye to the ones I cared about which is practically 0. I am a loser that hangs myself with a guitar string and is bullied daily. Thank you for the some out there that might of cared. I fell safe on the internet but not in real life. I hope my death is brutal and long so I can feel as much harm humanly possible to I die. I don't care if there is nothing after death. I am just typing to I feel a feeling in my heart. Goodbye. 3/5/2020 suicide date",5
"Laying bed listening to Joji and wishing I just didn't live on this Earth. I'm just so tired of existing. The stress is unbearable I don't know what to do. Just fucking venting on my phone because it sucks. Reasons to not off myself; 1) my sister moved in with my for university, 2) my mother.",4
"Growing up, people always tell me that I will be somebody and I can be whoever I wanna be if I put my mind into it, 10 years passed turns out I'm a nobody with no motivation to live.

Looking back, I wanna hug my old self and tell him to cherish every moment of being a young kid because the world is a harsh place to everyone and you'll also be a victim of society.

I'm nothing, worthless, and nobody. If I die nothing would happen... The world around me would still be the same...

People die every day, so what would make it different if I disappear? NOTHING! I decided to hang myself in the bathroom.

I cried with pain and satisfaction that I will be leaving this earth then the shower curtain rod in my bathroom broke...

It was a loud thud but luckily everyone's asleep... I proceeded to cry in silence and thinking about what should I do? 

I'm ugly, worthless, piece of crap, and a waste of oxygen... My acne scars make me feel like I'm nothing... Everything about me is SHIT.

I wanna die... or be murdered so I can blame somebody for my death.

I don't wanna live anymore...",1
"So, pretty much. I've been dealing with depression &amp; anxiety for quite a number of years, but I've going through a real low, rough patch at the moment. My self hatred has been growing rapidly &amp; to top it off, me and my now ex girlfriend broke up the other day. I was just wondering if any of you could just comment some positive things like inspiration and whatnot? Thank you all in advance. 

I hope everyone that's reading this right now are coping alright, you're never alone â¤ï¸",4
"Hi..I don't know where else to go. I am devastated right now, feeling like I'm spiraling out of control, I feel so fucking numb from crying my lungs out. Even my best friend is no longer supportive, my family, parents at home are shit. I have no real friends who care, and I can't be bothered to do anything right now, I just want to sleep without waking up to see another morning. I feel so fucking pathetic and shit, I cut myself regularly now and I'm having so much fucking self pity, I'm pretending to be normal because I don't want to lose my best friend, the only person who has helped me come this far from previous suicidal attempts. But suppressing it makes it so much fucking worse I feel like nobody fucking cares, no matter how many times I shout for help. No one close to me cares. I don't know what to do. I'm leaning towards paracetamol poisoning all over again, if I die I die, If I don't I try a different method. I just feel like absolute shit, jobless. I regret everything in my life, every fucking thing, I don't know who to trust anymore, I don't even have a fucking shoulder to lean on while crying my lungs out. Im in a LDR, from past 6 months, (not prior to that) as she's studying overseas, I can't even fucking have her hold me in her arms when I'm feeling like shit. She is the best and supportive, and my best friend but I can't hurt her by harming myself so It's a fucking struggle. I just feel so enraged and angry at everything..I can't fucking find a job due to covid-19. Sometimes it feels like If I had some money to get myself kicked off I can go near her and find a job and at least stay sane. But right now it all seems so fucking impossible I feel like I'm such a fucking mess and I just wish to fucking die right now, I feel so much burden when I inhale, I just want to die. I got no where else to go. I am planning on consuming meds tonight I just can't do it anymore.",2
"TL;DR: I'm feeling really down, have shut myself away, and don't know how to get through this anymore.

Hi, I'm Brendan. Im a 27(soon to be 28) y/o male, and I don't know what to do anymore. I've been trying to avoid posting because in the end I feel it doesn't matter anyway, but I have to say something.

This isn't a cry for help, I wouldn't accept any because I feel I should be able to get over my problems by myself.

I was diagnosed wish major depressive disorder at 15, then obsessive compulsive behavior at 23, with generalized anxiety coming in at 25. I know I cannot simply get over my issues because they're in my brain. I also know that it's all in my head, that's why they're called mental problems.

To get to the point, I'm lonely. I have like 3 friends, but I know if I had a girlfriend I would still be lonely. When I had one, who was amazing, I still was feeling alone. I really just think that it's all going so bad because I deserve it, and that it will make the good times seem better.

I'm not patient when it comes to my feelings. I want this feeling to go away more than anything. I've basically sheltered myself in my room for the past year and a half. I don't remember how to talk to people or act in public. I have a job, but only because I'm striving to not be homeless.

I'm sorry if anything I said upsets anyone somehow, I really needed to say something. I'm starting to lose the battle in my head again. I feel like I've been fighting it for much too long. I want to just give up fighting and give in to the sickness taking me over.

Not yet though. Trying to stay hopeful even when I don't know why.",3
"So I recently went to a therapist, because I have severe depression. I cannot afford to keep going, and I was hoping someone might have some suggestions or exercises in general to stop feeling sad. I'm looking for things I can do on a daily basis to improve over time. Any help is appreciated!",2
"My friends hype me up so much, and God love 'em for it, but there's just this enormous disconnect between how valuable they I say I am, and the level of value I feel and witness from potential dates and love interests. I don't know why it has to be this way. I don't know why I should be so painfully alone, and feel so unlovable.",1
"I think I really want and end now, I'm not gonna do it soon though everyone will be so beat up about not being able to to help.
I'm gonna just get back on with things and work and get another job and earn as much money as possible and I'll eat and workout and I'll do everything I planned to with this year.
I'll go to all the therapy and the assessments.
I'll stop with social media and wean people away slowly I guess and I'll move away again like every knows I always planned to and then I'll go.
I've been here before and then I felt hope that one day I'd be okay but I'm back there again, I never ever wanted to feel this again. To be honest I'll probably end up feeling okay but the fear of feeling like this again it's worth those periods of okay.
I wasn't meant to be here and I'm sorry to everyone.
I have every wish I've ever prayed for now and I still feel numb, i only ever wanted to feel happy.
I go out with euphoria as planned and I'll mention no one in my note you all deserve so much better.
I don't see anything else fixing this",2
"My family hates me. I have no friends. I have no college degree and have had 7 jobs in the last 3 years.

"I'm a 26 year old male. I'm always, ALWAYS worried about something. It could be big, or it could be small, but no matter what im always worried. When I say worried, I'm not talking about your everyday anxiety. I'm talking about constant panic attacks. Im 26, and I've had people guess I'm 40. The only time I have relief is in my sleep. Everytime things seem to be looking up, something always manages to go wrong. My anxiety has turned into rage over the years, and I'm getting closer, and closer to snapping everyday. I clean brathrooms for a living, and someone could so much as ask me if they could use the bathroom as I'm trying to clean it, and I want to rip their heads off there fucking shoulders. I'm almost afraid I might hurt someone soon, as I feel I have nothing to live for anymore. I've felt how I do for the past 10 years, and it's not getting any better. I'm a vile person. I've been told by countless people, that I'm a vile person. If you knew what I've done, youd think I was a vile person. Theres no turning back from the things I've done, that's why i have nothing to lose, and i feel it's time to inflict my pain upon others. The thought of disappointing my parents, and them seeing me for the monster I am comforts me. I really dont see me living this life much longer.",3
"My mom relies on marijuana and other pain relieving drugs to get through her day. She takes her frustrations out on me. Calls me lazy and other names daily. I fucking try my best, and its hard. Why does no-one understand!. She's gonna be so fucking upset when i kill myself, or will she? Life would be so much better for her. I wanna give up. Im exhausted.",4
"Every interaction just feels fake. I always want to be the popular guy (charismatic) considering I dont have many friends if any and hide away from people spending at least 15 hours a day in a room watching tv shows I've seen 100s of times. I just dont want to do anything. I have no interest in starting hobbys. I go to the gym and during the work out. Theres just a constant your not good enough, people are just being nice and dont really like you, they know your fake and try hard. Im conscious of everything how I walk, talk etc. I cant seem to accept myself, struggle with being authentic and just fill myself with information on the subject. 

I know I have to stop being a bitch and get a grip but it's like an internal battle and its exhausting. It's like I cant just let go for some reason.


I basically live in my mind with thoughts of being inadequate or fake in all areas, 
slowing falling into a victim role. 
I dont know who I am. If that makes sence.
Any suggestions or people who can relate ?",1
I'm so happy that I'm dropping out but now I got more things to worry about. Nicee,2
"I know we'd all like to believe the answer is ""yes"", and maybe it is, but there's a lot working against you when you find yourself in this predicament. 


Anyone else in this same boat? I was going to try to make a more comprehensive post, but maybe I'll just start with this and respond to what others say.",0
"Everyday, I'm wishing and hoping that the next day would be different. Hoping that everytime I wake up, I wake up in the reality not this nightmare anymore. But the more I hope, the higher I fall. Exhausted of everything it won't change. I just want to end it.",5
"The method of suicide I selected is hypothermia. There's a river near my house with 40 degree water Fahrenheit, 4 degrees Celsius. Being in there at night, no one would see me. I would tie a rope to a life jacket and confine myself to a tree so I don't drift along the current to a spot where someone would find me. Death would occur within a couple of hours of being in the water, and unconsciousness would happen before then. This method is easy to pull off because it doesn't involve highly intense pain, and I can get out if I really want to.

The problem is that this isn't going to work soon, due to the warmer seasons approaching. I have to quickly decide if I want to die. I'm afraid that if I don't act now, I'll regret it and have to endure life for another year, but I'm also not 100% set on death just yet.",3
"There are probably serial killers who sleep easier at night and with fewer regrets than me and I try so dang hard to be nice to people. I want to support my friends the best I can. If anyone else I knew said this I'd be reassuring them in a second. Why can't this apply to me, why do I hate myself",1
"So I like to help people through their suicidal thoughts. I really do. But sometimes when helping people I feel like a fraud knowing one day sooner than later, I'm going to end my own life. I always say in my head that I'm helping those who are going through a rough period in their lives and that it will get better for them. I truly believe that. I just don't believe I'm ever going to get better. I kinda know better for myself. This has been something I've lived with forever, what's the point in lying to myself.",1
"I'm 24, all I have is a shitty degree in translation, no job, no close friends. I feel like such a disappointment, my life is going nowhere, I wake up and I have to face that I'm a faliure compared to my sister and brother every single day. I see no point in living, I'm just a burden to my parents so I feel like it doesnt matter what happens in the future, I'll end up killing myself. I know is going to sound dramatic but I feel it in my cells - I'm going to kill myself at some point in my life. I wish I could do it right now but at least I wanna save some money to pay for the funeral and the other stuff. I don't wanna be a burden in death lol.",2

"I've made a whole google doc sheet about how I'm going to kill myself and it looks pretty good with 31 ways in the list. I don't have any emotional support around, my mum would just give me silent treatment when I say how I feel. I get anxiety attacks often a lot of times and it's really hard for me to open up around here. Should've just stayed in college than come at the wrong place (ie. Here). When I get any idea of my own, they'd shut it down or give no response. I don't know if I'm even going to survive in any corporate workplace.",1
"The reason I drink is to self medicate because I saw my friend pass away in a car accident when I was 19. We were both stupid and I challenged him to a race using our parents cars. Basically, he understeered into a tree. I have tried therapy but it didn't work for me. I was also diagnosed with PTSD and depression. I stopped taking my prescription because it didn't work for me. I feel that I have blood on my hands because I was the one who made him do it. 

My parents and grandfather came to me and told me that they were worried about my drinking problem. I sometimes drink a bottle of Vodka a day. I just want to drink myself to death. My granddad tried to relate to the situation by telling me about the things he was in Vietnam. I walked out because I was upset about everything. I now think that I was out of order and I would do anything to apologise. But at the same time, I feel that they shouldn't have bought my grandfather along because he is getting Parkinsons disease so I don't want him to worry about me as well.",3
"I'm sure that a ton of your day is ruined by your head that always screams you're not good enough or that you messed up. I know there's something in your mind that always pushes and locks away the good values of yourself, so you can only see the negatives. I know something like that is there. 

I also know that I'm just another person behind a screen, casually typing away whilst you decide to read this. Well, I love you. Like, I love you so bad and to lose someone like you would break my heart, it's okay to cry, it's okay to feel bad, it's okay to feel like giving up. But hey, I want to let you know that you're still here. And if you're sitting here, wanting it to be your final hours, then I'm glad that I still get to talk to you and tell you that I adore every part of you; every smile you've ever made, tear you've cried, every part of you from your head to toe makes me uncontrollably happy. 

I know you're beautiful, happy or sad, excited or angry. You're the most beautiful person to you, you want to know why? Because you've been going on for so long that you've shaped yourself, and you can never be wrong about yourself. You're the most talented and awesome person I've met. And you continue to amaze me everyday by how you manage to wake up day after day, even with the dreaded feeling that you can't do it, you're so amazing that I can't even begin to wonder why you don't want to be here. 

I love you, you're the brightest star in the sky, you're the shiniest diamond in the rough, you're the sun in my solar system. 

You've got this.",0
I've lost all my friends over the past year. Got dumped by me gf last year. Nobody checks up on me. Girls don't even wanna talk to me. I'm so lonely. I don't think I can take it much longer. I'm tired of praying. I don't believe in god anymore. Every time I pray it brings nothing. Everyday that passes makes me realize how worthless my life is. I just don't know what to do anymore.i think I'm gonna end it in about a week after I have time to get things together and write a few notes.,4
"Throwaway, because all my friends and such know my account. I know they care, and that's what hurts me the most.

My head has always been a conflicting cloud of thoughts.

I keep thinking if I were to die, maybe everybody would be happier. Maybe I'll stop being such a fuck up. Maybe everybody would think of me as this better version of myself after I'm gone.

I'm young, and I know there's so much ahead for me, that maybe one day things will get better. But it's been so incredibly hard, and I don't think I can do it anymore. My stay at the psych ward made me behind in school, it made me feel selfish for wanting to work on myself, that I was causing pain for others.

I sometimes think that maybe if I was gone, people wouldn't need to worry anymore.

I wouldn't need to go chat to certain people to feel better.

I wouldn't stay in bed and cry all day about how much I just want to disappear.

I've been thinking about hanging myself, but after reading about how much it gets fucked up, I'm starting to think of a different method.

I don't know.

I just feel as if today is going to be my last.",5
"It's a very long story but to shorten it a bit. I'm getting kicked out of crisis housing for having my dog which they knew about, on the property. Just gonna state here that she was apart of my agreement because she's going to be a service dog for me. 

They've now changed there minds 4 months later &amp; saying that I can stay but she can't. I'm basically being forced to be homeless &amp; no one really seems to care. I've been reaching out to those I love... but nothing. All too busy or something better. 

I know they say don't give up, it'll get there but when? For the past 2 years I had cancer, after I found out I was in remission &amp; this program a youth organisation had accepted me, the Australian bush fires started which effected my family home. I lost my granddad as well now they're doing this. Just when is it gonna end",3

"I see memes everyday and occasionally nose exhale, but shit I just don't have that same vibe anymore. I hate being alone all the time, I won't even speak for an entire week because I have no one to talk to here at college. Doesn't help when my only friend group at home is breaking apart slowly. Shit hurts. Can't fucking talk to anyone, don't know how to keep conversations going even over text with new people.",5
"This is a long text about what I'm dealing with.. just giving you a heads up.I hate embarrassing myself and I act in a way I dont like. I maybe acting in a way which balances all the embarrassments I deal with. 

I keep thinking about past moments where it's fucking embarrassing and then I hate to fight to being the person to desire to be. By embarrassing it means either people telling me on my face which hurts me and they know it but still choose to say it because they know Im boring now and I don't have the confidence they saw in me they used to. I'm on their side on this cuz I they are true. And I don't know how to help myself out of this. 

To be honest I'm lonely like literally lonely only because of me. I'm not open about my feelings and try to just move the conversation about general things. I only love people but not give back anything or show it. Theres not a single person who I have a nice relationship with right now. I mean to say I don't have but they do. Few of my friends care about me and don't want me to get hurt but that's all. I don't like my family because I'm thinking like this just because of their conditioning . I hate my insecure mom who is highly egoistic of herself and can't handle rejection or appreciation she gets defensive for very small things and also expects me to show love to her and give the attention she needs all the time and if I don't do it she gets hurt again and gets defensive. I hate that she's like that and that's in me . That is my biggest problem because I have conversations in my head to fix her cuz I don't want her to be that way and I do this therapeutic talk all the time with her and me. Im starting to get sick of it and handle this. I know all the ways she can't get offended and it's not hard and it's my problem to deal with convincing her. I can't fucking do it I wanna leave her but I can't live with guilt she has given me till now that I can't live by knowing she's gonna get mental if I leave her. She has friends but they're cringe as fuck saying I love you or I hate you. All they talk about is that. She wants everything without deserving it. 

When I say all this about her I know that I act like her and when I say I hate her I hate the part of me that's her. That part of me is not leaving me. I try to give people guilt trips unconsciously or give them situations where I get rejected and I won't take it properly. This feeling of being alone after someone shows that they don't like me is what I want to feel but I want to say to mind that noone likes me and I'm alone. 

Today I truly feel like I don't have a friend to share any of my feelings to because it is truly cringe worthy and embarrassment because I feel like this. I have a lot of potential in me . I have great looks. Im smart. I'm talenting in coding. I'm very funny sometimes. But my ego which judges me and judges others gets all its data and fucks me over and convincing me to feel shitty and unmotivated all the time. 

I can't say these things to anyone I know and I'm always confused with the way I think I don't know what's a good thought or a bad thought because they have their own points which are opposite. Im conditioning and people are trying. To get rid of me because they don't like me anymore. I'm boring and I don't want to settle to this but I'm setting. I hate that this happening but not enough.

This is very general when I say people or feelings but this insecurity in a college environment. Everyone is different here and there only a few cool people. Every friend i know is a confident secure person and deals with Thier problems with friends together. I can't have that.

My personality is dead because of the shit thats in my head. The therapeutic talk. The polar opposite debates about feelings. Numbness. And living with the shitty version of myself. I know this is mood. In other times when I feel genuinely happy I have an answer that says just keep going through whatever it is and it's easy. It's not really easy at other times. And we don't know how long should I wait for the next mood switch to happen.",1
"I dont know what to do anymore. I was 4 months away from getting married to my best friend of 10 yrs! He says he doesn't know what he wants . Everything was fine. He was actively planning the wedding with me, calling me his fiancee and handing out save the dates. He says he needs time, so I left the house and next week it'll be 1 month of our separation. Everyone is saying ""its better that it happened now vs later"" but it still hurts like hell. I ask for a reason to all of this and he says he doesnt know himself. He posts on instagram that he had to use 100% of his energy to let me go and that i will be happier with someone else. But the thing is I dont want anyone else and i will always choose him. I told him that and he doesnt say anything except not to push him. I love him so much and my heart feels like its going to explode and i feel like dying everyday! I know there are worse things that are happening in the world, and i feel stupid for saying this but i would rather die than to be without him. Not all relationships are perfect, yes we had our issues but we always found a way to work it out. This time around it really CAME OUT OF NO WHERE, it literally blindsided me. I feel crushed and i find myself just going through the motions as to not alarm my family, but I just cant do it anymore. I need my best friend back, I need the love of my life back....I cant tell anyone how i feel because they instantly tell me he is an idiot for leaving you and that i will find someone else. But i dont want anyone else. I just want him...sometimes when im driving back to my parents house (i had to move back in with them) i find myself longing to just drive the car off the road, so that way if i die people would say it was an accident and not that i intentionally did it myself...",4

"My mood fluctuations have not changed over the past year at all, despite me starting medication. However what I have noticed is that I'm able to contextualise thoughts and feelings a lot easier these days. For example I'm feeling fairly rubbish at the moment, but instead of the thoughts of loneliness and inadequacy I used to get with these feelings, I now just look forward to not feeling like this. It comes in waves and always has done, but I'm feeling it is affecting my productivity a lot less than it used to, obviously I'm more productive when I'm not feeling like this, but by Monday I probably won't feel like this.

I used to have thoughts of ending it, still do sometimes but I'm glad I didn't. I'm much happier now that I know it's not constant. I hope anyone who currently feels as though they're in a trough can see that it won't always be this way, and there are sunnier days ahead.",5
"I called the hotline, and said exactly that. And honestly I don't know what I was expecting. But what I got was a dude who read off a bunch of questions. I answered. Then I got transferred to a sassy lady who informed me that she could either send out a team to collect me and take me to the hospital, or she could call 911. 

I repeated myself. I can't afford the hospital. The lady told me those are my options.

I've been dealing with some mental health issues since I was a kid, but they've really exploded in the last 2-3 years. I get why people with depression kill themselves. 

I don't want to die because I'm sad. I want to die because this is going to happen for the rest of my life, and I cannot agree to that. I never thought I'd be a person who would do this, but I've been strongly considering it even when I'm not sad.

Help. I don't want to hurt myself, but I can't do this again and again. I can't.",3
"I, like I think many people here, like to sometimes exist in a fantasy world, where we are worshiped or heroes or even the creators, as a means of escaping.

I, like I suspect many here are, am a massive anime and fantasy nerd, but also am very into science explaining stuff. 

The other night I types ESP / Psychic into Google Scholar and I stumbled upon a great book called Psychic Deadness- Michael Eigen, which so aptly describes a lot of the sentiment I can feel from this sub. 

If you are able to, give the first few pages a read and maybe this can help you articulate your own emotions better and find the source of a lot of the suffering",0
"I thought everything was fine, we even had plans to hang out that day, she said she loved me, I said I loved her. Then that night she told me she couldn't be in a relationship with me.

"I dont deserve love. Im fucked up and im a mess. The reason why i dont have a relationship is because i feel like people deserve something better than me. Im shit. Im trash.

I have no friends texting me, im just the guy in the group no one is best friend with but i still hang out. Im alone. Im lost. Im drinking again, dont know what else to do to numb the pain. Maybe my death will end this. I deserve death not love. Maybe ill die tomorow. Maybe in 10 years. Only time will tell. I survived 4 suicide attemps for this life and nothing is doing better.",4
"On mobile so if my formatting sucks, well that's another thing I've failed at.

I've been fighting my whole life to survive. I was severely biasd and neglected as a child. My childhood was a constant battle, being beaten, starved, mentally biasd and broken down. 
As a teen I was sexually assaulted at 14 by step brother then my â€œbest friendâ€ at 15. Still being mentally biasd by my mother. Which led to a suicide attempt at 16, I took a bottle of Xanax and oxy. Sadly, I was found woke up in the hospital having a tube being shoved down my throat and the taste of charcoal. Soon after I got in a relationship with a man who cut me off from my friends and family. Beat me and made to tell me how worthless I am on a daily basis. Got away at 18 almost 19. Which involved him stalking me and terrorizing me. Ive been struggling with a eating disorder that whole time. At 19 met my soon to be ex husband he was never abusive just clueless, everything I did was never good enough. Never validated my feelings. I had 5 children from 21-29. I left my husband at 30, got in a relationship with another man. Who ended up abusing me. He raped me, beat me, and mentally biasd me. He also introduced me to drugs. Now I've been struggling with addiction, and an eating disorder. I left him 4 months in that was last year. Pressed charges, my soon to be ex husband has given me a place to stay because he needs the nanny. But his mom is moving in. And I'm going to be homeless, I know my kids deserve so much more than a mentally broken mother who is so withdrawn. So I gave custody freely to him. I am so tired of struggling with my thoughts. I have been fighting my whole life. I can't anymore. 

I have a plan next week to get a hotel and make it look like a accidental overdose so my ex gets all the life insurance money. 

Btw this post can't even be linked to me, I have two phones. My main one is the one everyone knows about. I use a vpm on this phone. So there's no way they would know I posted this when I took my life. 

I just don't think I can do it anymore.",1
"Pretty sure this will get buried in all the other posts but I guess I need somewhere to vent... either that or i just want to remind myself what a piece of shit i am. 

I've been depressed pretty much my entire life, i never realised it, i thought everyone was sad all the time and had a constant pit in their stomach like they wanted to cry and had random thoughts about killing themselves. 
I've been going through this shit since elementary school. 
I've always been the akward kid that was overly loud and made jokes at my own expense in order to get others to crack a smile. 
I've never been good at keeping friendships let alone making friendships. Ive always considered myself a loner in a way, mainly because I always feel like I want to be alone. 

I've never been to a party unless it was for a birthday, never gone drinking with friends, never really had a conversation with anyone without it turning into an akward silence after a while. 
I'm currently a senior in highschool and I feel like I've wasted my highschool years. 

My freshman year I met this girl, she was great, caring, shy, cute, and seemed to truly listen to what i said. 
I never had the balls to ask her out which I suppose was a good thing because later on I found out that she was gay. 

After half a year, she got more and more involved with the highschool lgbt community which was full of just flat out rude people. 
This changed her... for the worse. She started spending alot less time with me, and before I knew it we had gone an entire month without spending any time together. I'd always ask her if she wanted to hang out but she was always ""busy"". 

She slowly started to do a complete 180 from who she used to be. She was becoming very self centered and was always saying how nice of a person she is. 
I eventually stopped talking to her completely because I realised she was destroying me. I was in love with who she used to be and I guess I thought that the harder I tried to be her friend, maybe shed start to like being around me again, i guess i was wrong. 
At one point i stopped even acknowledging her like she did to me and i guess this annoyed her because she would text me and ask me why i was doing it. 
I'd send a lengthy text explaining why and it's like she didnt even read it because she kept doing the exact same things that i told her were making me feel like trash below her. 

This friendship absolutely destroyed me and i became extremely depressed. I became somewhat of a hermit that would go to school and as soon as I got home would sleep until the next day. 
I still am really sad about what happened and I cant help but blame myself for not doing something or saying something earlier about how her friends were making her treat others. 

Well, basically, this kind of destroyed me self esteem and any confidence I had left. I was now the quiet kid at school, although my friend says that i dont really seem like the quiet type, I'm 6 foot 2 inches tall and am built like a ""viking"" as he says. 
I havent spent time with him in months because I can barely bring myself to leave my house. 
He is pretty much my last friend and i feel like I'm letting him slip away like i have with all my other friends and its destroying me but I'm too afraid to do anything about it. I hate myself, I'm a terrible friend and I dont know how to change it. 

I've always been known as the ""nice guy"" who helps in any way I can and likes to talk to anyone who is willing to give me the time of day. Now.... well I dont even know. 
There was a lady at the store the other day who dropped something, she had a cane and her arms full and I just fucking watched her struggle to pick her stuff up off the ground. What kind of fucking person just watches someone struggle??? Apparently I do... I just like, froze I guess, I couldn't move my body, it was like I was paralyzed and I had a pit in my stomach and I felt just really anxious if that's how youd describe it. 
I hate who I've become, I just want to go back to being the kind guy who always helps others instead of watching them struggle like a jackass. 

I dont know how to fix who I have become and I'm afraid it's going to affect me when I try and get a job this summer and when I go to college, I'm afraid I'm going to be this shell of who i used to be, someone who just watches things happen instead of giving a helping hand. I feel like agoddamn failure, mainly because I am. 

I guess this story type thing doesnt really have any point, just me talking to myself reflecting on how much of an asshole I am. If someone actually reads this, well, then I'd love any suggestions on how i can get rid of this damn shell. 

I left alot of details out, but it's 1am and I have school in the morning so maybe I'll come back sometime on my computer and fill in a bit more. 
Thanks for reading this if you did, I sincerely hope you dont have to go through what I've gone through.",2
"I'm 17, and I've been feeling this way ever since I was 15. I have no friends, social anxiety and I've been homeschooled since I was 5. And to top it all off, I have asperger's syndrome. I'd give away everything I have just to have at least one real friend who understands me and just to be normal.

My anxiety has gotten so bad that I can barely even go out anymore. I for some reason have a huge fear of kids around my age. I almost had a panic attack just for checking out my new college with my mum. I don't think I'll ever make it there. I like a lot of stuff that I'm sure no one my age likes and I get angry at my relatives for no reason. 

I hate being a teen. Why do hormones exist? Why is everything so complicated? Why am I losing my mind? I never used to have to worry about any of this shit as a little kid. I wish I could go back in time and undo whatever the fuck it was that made me this way. I come from a good family, so it's not family related. Only thing I do is isolate myself from the entire world + my family by just staying in my room playing games and watching videos. I can't do anything else.

The only thing keeping me alive is my family. I cry or feel like crying whenever I picture them looking in horror at me taking my life.",4
"I'm obviously not. Depressed as I'll ever be, walking through life numb, detached, lonely, empty, feeling dejected, with no light at the end of the tunnel. Stop trying to fix me and give me cliche advice, because at the end of the day I'm still going to be depressed.",5
"I've said my goodbyes. I think I'm ready and I broke up with my boyfriend, hopefully since he'll find out later and/or not at all or won't hurt him. I just have no more energy left for the life I'm living.",4
"My partner is the most happy, positive, loving person in the world. I have never met anyone like him, he's so special and he makes me feel things I've never felt before. But it kills me how much shit I put him through all the time. He sees me when I'm depressed and it hurts him, and I lash out on him because I'm not feeling well and I have mood swings. And somehow it bothers me even more that he doesn't mind, he doesn't get offended or angry, I could be absolutely horrible to him and he would just show me endless love and try to comfort me and reassure me he's where he wants to be.

I know I should be happy, but it bothers me so much. I'm constantly tormented by feeling like an awful person for doing mean things to someone so amazing. A little voice in my head never stops telling me he deserves better and I would be doing him a favour if I broke up with him. Yeah, he would be hurt for a little while, but he'd get over me and then he could find someone who treats him the way he should be treated. I wish I could treat him right but I feel like I have no control over my mood swings.

There's also a selfish part of me that thinks I would feel better if I broke up with him and didn't have to feel so guilty all the time. I feel like I'm going to end up ruining him, he's so positive and he brightens up every room he's in, but what if my sadness rubs off on him? I'd be hurt too if we split up but I deserve that, he doesn't deserve a monster like me.

That's it, I just kind of wanted to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading :)",4
"(Venting, throwaway account for privacy.)

My mind is blank. I cannot think. I don't want to eat. I don't want to try anymore. I've been trying for almost 30 years now. It hasn't gotten better like everyone said it would. It's just been a series of ups and downs, a rollercoaster that never seems to end. I fucking hate it.

My partner's grad program fucked us over with direct deposit again, so now all our bills are gonna be overdue. Again. We barely have food in the house, and neither of us have had the mental energy lately to cook what we do have. I could pick up more shifts to work all weekend for pennies to try and slowly pay a tiny bit of everything off, but I won't be able to make enough to pay everything. I'll work myself to the brink of death again just to barely get by, smoke to get through the day, and drink to fall asleep at night. Or I could just end it all.

My partner knows I'm mentally ill and tries their best. They go above and beyond any efforts I've ever seen, including my own parents. I don't want to leave them behind. I feel so guilty for feeling this way. But I just can't keep going like this. I want this to be over. And there's no end in sight. So I should just make my own exit.",2

"It all started 2 years ago when on my 15th birthday my friend gifted me a video game called CSGO and I though it was gonna be the best thing ever as I was new to gaming. Then I met a guy from the UK by the name Nukes on steam ( a gaming platform) and he was good friends with me for a year we used to play sometimes and chit chat about csgo trading and stuff. And then my next birthday I decided to buying a $100 steam wallet code with all my saving of past year + birthday money ( its a big deal for me as I dont have a job yet student nor rich) and Nukes told me his ideas and how it would be great if I could send it to him and he could get me profit from trading items in the game ( he was on steam for 3-4 years already) so like any innocent person I went with it. Then it started. Me finding out he lied to me and started blackmailing me, acting racist to me, forcing me to do stuff like shaving my eveybrows and calling his friend the n word on tape if I wanted my money back, I was naive and though if this is how I could get my money back it wont be a big deal. It went on from there, he moved on to asking my socials and always under the pretext one last thing you need to do, I was getting severely cyber bullied and biasd day and night but didn't tell anyone and use to cry everyday at night. He even went on stalk my youtube channel make more false promises, message my real life friends when I tried to block him and lure me back. It has made me really sucidal over the last 2 years and now I can't live with this anymore. I never though like would be this bad and for my lost money I would lose so much more as far as my will to live.",1
"Hello, I genuinely want to die. It's been like this for months now (it somehow only grew worse), and I really thought antidepressants would magically cure me, but I haven't been feeling much of a difference.

I can't kill myself because of the emotional toll it would have on my family, so if I can't do that, what can I do?

I think the next best thing is to commit â€œemotional suicideâ€. Living each day being practically dead, yet somehow alive. I've been trying so hard to get better, but every fibre of my being wants to die.

If I lived each day being a zombie, with little to no emotions, I think it would be better than feeling constant dread.

I don't even know anymore, I just deeply loathe myself, but I don't know what to do. I'm even supposed to be at school right now, but I felt extremely shitty, and couldn't even manage to muster up a shred of self-esteem to present myself at school.",5

I am tired of it and I just want it to stop. 

I feel guilty for existing. It's like imposter syndrome but for being a person. I feel as though I don't have the abilities needed to make my dreams come true, to be genuinely loved by someone, to be resilient enough to withstand the heartache I feel now and the heartache that is inevitably to come. I feel too old to still be self harming and feeling like a ghost. I feel like I don't exist already, but somehow I'm still here. The existential dread is also unbearable and I don't know how to lift this crushing weight in my chest. I just want to disappear completely.",5
"I feel pretty down every month or so, very down. I usually feel self hate and loneliness.

"I don't know if this belongs here and I apologize if it doesn't. This post is meant to be rhetorical. No additional details will be provided and no feedback is required. Just getting some thoughts out of my head in hopes my brain can find a little peace.

Recently I've been dealing with a lot of negativity. I'm in jeopardy of losing my family due to some actions I've taken/decisions I've made. My girlfriend and her two little boys have given my life purpose. Before they became my life I would spend more nights at the bar than not, simply because it was something to do. I didn't do this to pick up chicks or anything, it just was better than sitting at home. If I lose them I don't really know what I would do with my life.

There's a quote from Ernest Hemingway that goes ""Every man hasÂ two deaths, when he is buried in the ground and the last time someone says his name."" I am by no means contemplating suicide or being buried. It got me thinking about completely severing ties with everyone I've ever known and starting life over somewhere else though. Essentially burying the life I've had so far.

How long would it take before my friends and family stop trying to find me? How long before I'm not a daily/weekly/monthly thought on their mind? How long before I'm a distant memory or not a memory at all. Could I even do it? I already go weeks without talking to my parents. Longer without talking to my family. Random amounts of time without talking to friends. There's few people I talk to daily and the only person I can say I talk to daily with 100% certainty is my girlfriend. 

I wonder if I could truly run away from it all and start a new life if the life I have now falls apart. Could I manage to find a new purpose that wouldn't be caught in the shadow of the purpose I feel now?",4
"I mean yes never feeling happiness, always feeling tired, and all that other shit that comes with depression would've contributed to this, but I think I'm just using depression as an excuse to hide the fact that I'm a terrible person.

I've had depression since at least the age of 10. I'm 17 now and until about a year or two ago my depression was never a huge problem. I was passing school, I had friends and I had hobbies. But one day after my suicide attempt I got a random boost in motivation, and I felt happiness for the first time in years. Feeling happiness only made me realize how miserable I am all the time, which led to me figuring out that I have depression.

Ever since I became aware of this, I started doing things like, failing school, ghosting friends, and dropping out of hobbies. Whenever I smile or laugh, I hide it and try my best to make myself sad. I fetishized my sadness, sadness was my happy place, and being happy was painful for me. I feel like I'm just putting on a play for myself to hide the fact that I'm just a selfish ass, who does nothing but play videogames all day. Now here's a good confession, I don't have a suicide attempt, yeah when the the day came I was to lazy to get out of bed and walk to the railway so I just didn't. Yet everyone I've told my story to has heard me talk about my suicide attempt, I told myself this so much that I actually forgot I never even tried for a while, but it's all a lie, just an excuse to make me look more broken then I already am. Some days I think of actually going there, and reenacting that moment to see if I'll actually do it or not, but I'm to lazy to get out of bed so as if I'd do that.

I fear that my therapist will find out. That if I get cured from my depression that I'm still going to be just as shitty as always and that it was just me all along. If that's true then that means there's no curing me, and that I'm just going to be like this forever.",3
"Man, holy fuck. I feel very neutral or passive right now. For the past 3 odd days I've just kind of been floating by. I've tried to kill myself twice in the past 5 months.

I have a truck, an apartment to myself, a cat, and a decently paying job (I'm surviving, ha). I just feel so goddamn lonely.

I've suffered from my trauma that didn't come to surface until I was 16. So I've just been dealing with that for a while and I can't seem to overcome it. I've tried a couple medications but they don't really seem to work. Killing myself seems to be only way to end my pain. I can't function as a human. I just get so tired, mentally and physically. I always hope for things to get better but they never do. Im just a fat sack of shit who won't accomplish anything in their life. I feel I can't say anything how I truly feel. I fucking hate being alive. I feel like I'm living for other people, no one is listening to what I want.",5
"Post in question: https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/fdwfoq/yesssss/

Everyone always says diet/exercise/sleep...etc to help combat depression. However, over the years I have periodically thrown myself into all of those and when I do my depression gets worse. Like instead of just existing now I'm adding more work to my plate that I do not enjoy. Anyone else feel the same way when they try the common recommendations?",1
"I started my current job almost a year ago when I was in a really good place mentally. I've been really depressed before, and so I recognize the signs for me: first, anxiety and weightloss; then irritability, short-temperedness, and lots of suicidal thoughts. I know ""it gets better"", and I will get through this. However, the last time I was going through this I was still in college, but now I spend 8 hours a day for five days a week with the same people. I don't know how to keep this from affecting my work or my friendships/relationships with my coworkers and even my boss. Help!",2
"This keeps happening, i dont know if its my ptsd or anxiety or a panic attack but i start to think about everything and i begin to panic and i am hyperventilating and feel like im trapped and i dont know where to go or what to do, i want to find support for everything and i just dont know where to go i have no one and nothing in my life i feel so alone and so desperate im terrified

"People keep telling me that if I kill myself, then the depression will win the fight. Here's the catch, they think I fucking care if it wins. I don't give a shit anymore. I'm not even using a throwaway account because I don't care about keeping it a secret. Why would I care if the depression wins? All I want is peace, and if it takes the depression winning over me to achieve that, then why should I care at all? I don't. 

Idk why I'm even posting here. I'm not sure if I'm subconsciously looking for help, or just attention. Who knows. I don't want to hurt my family, but at the same time I'm hurting them when I even tell them about my thoughts. I can't fucking win anything anymore. I don't know what to do. I'm so goddamn pathetic it's unbelievable. Sometimes I wish I was killed by a robber or shooter just so I didn't have to worry about my family wondering what they did wrong.",5
"Every time I go home, I'll start to overthink.

Then the feels would just all come attacking me.

Staying at the office just lets me forget the things that haunts me.

Sometimes I would just lay in the rest area for hours with a relaxed feeling and it would be the opposite when I get home.

The only reason I go home is because I have to take care of the family.

I even get good sleeps at the office than at home.",4
"I'm at the point where I'm fine with accidents that can happen, where it be I'm driving and a truck speeds and hits me, riding on train and exploding, walking on the sidewalk and hoping a car would hit me or I get snatched and be killed, walking alone late at night and some thugs beat me up. Heck if I had a sickness I wouldn't tell anyone and just die.",1

I have been recently writing my thoughts on a note app whenever I feel suicidal. Sometimes it helps. How about you? What are your ways of coping when it happens?,0
"So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried. Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. My psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but I've been putting off actually making the appointment because I'm scared.

You know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty? It's sort of like that, except in reverse. I've had my depression for well over a decade, more than half my life, and I literally can't imagine what it'd be like if it actually got better. Would I still feel like me? I know that things would improve, obviously, but change is scary, and in a bizarre way, my depression is comfortable. It's been a constant for most of my life and I don't know who I'd be without it.

TL;DR- I'm scared to try something that could work because I don't know who I'd be without my depression.",3

"Ok so while this is definitely not my first time going to counseling, this was the first meeting with a new counsellor. It was set up through my work's EAP service, which I've used before with limited success. 

Anyway, I had my first session this week and it was weird. First of all, it was in a very unconventional location. It was in an office (I mean literally a room with a desk and some office chairs), inside an organization not typically known for mental health services. So that was weird and it took me a while to get comfortable enough to start talking. 

Since this was the first session, most of it was just me explaining what was going on in my life and why I'm there. Anyway, near the end she remarked that I was a fascinating person and she really wants to talk to me more. That's my first time hearing that, especially from a professional. Then she asked me if I was familiar with the mbti, to which I replied I am not a fan. She also suggested I check out metaphysics because it might help me or something. 

I Dunno , I walked out of there feeling strange. On one hand, the counselor was nice and all, but on the other hand, certain things made me a bit uncomfortable. 

Anybody else have any similar experiences? Should I stick with it or find someone else?",3

"I don't know if this is the right place to post about this, but I thought I would give it a shot.

I've been an artist my whole life, ever since I can remember. I went through many years of art school, and while studying I was doing well. Art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and I've always wanted to be an artist more than anything else.

But I've also had mental health issues my entire life, and I've gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. I've been medicated since I was a child, so that's helped most of the time. But now, starting last autumn, I've gone into a depressive period that's a bit different than the previous ones. 

I think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. I did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so I think burnout is very likely. In any case, I started to notice that I didn't enjoy drawing anymore.

Drawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. It started to feel like way too much work - and that work was not interesting or exciting. The work was also difficult and just SO much. SO many lines. Honestly, when I think about drawing I start to feel physically unwell. 

I've been advised to take a break from drawing, and I'm doing so. I haven't actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and I'm going for one month. 

I'm just so terrified that I'll never enjoy drawing again. I can't even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. But I still want to be an artist so much. Plus, I honestly don't have any other hobbies unrelated to art that I could focus on. Nothing else really interests me.

I should also mention that I'm switching medications right now, and I'm about to go onto a full dose of my new medication (which is actually one that's worked for me in the past). 

I've never experienced anything like this, and I'm so scared. Any thoughts or advice would be super appreciated.",3

"People need to realise and understand just how much bullshit suicide prevention is.

Because Yes, lets put posters to the suicide hotline a bit everywhere, look, we're only helping!

The suicide hotline! yes ! of course! why didn't I think of that?

All those things are there to make other people happy and fool them into thinking ""They're doing a great job helping!"" 
You're really not.

How about this one? Force them to seek counselling 
Ah yes! Because talking about how I feel is going to make my problems go away! Of course 
Well, you'll get tools to /cope/ with those things, see - 
Oh! but it won't resolve any of the underlying issues, I see, you're only treating the symptoms of flesh eating disease.

Institutionalisation? 
Well, how about fuck you Sheryl. Because isolating me even more really is going to help. 
But YOU can rest assured that /you did everything you could/! Look! the problem is no longer visible to you!
So therefore it must be working! 
Pat yourself on the shoulder, you did a great job! 
That person surely isn't going to fold into themselves even more than they already have
as they just sit around looking at blank walls, waiting for there next therapy session with doctors that are too rushed 
or overworked to care or do any good. 
It's like facing the corner for ""adults"". Think nice and hard about what you did! See you in three weeks! 

Well, how about numbing him AND therapy? 
Listen Maribeth, why do you think that's going to work? Because there's an entire industry around it? 
That must mean it HAS to be successful! Everyone! Everytime! Guaranteed! 
Surely it can ONLY /help/ those poor depressed souls, because the good doctor and the books say that it works
Surely their one follow-up call to re-make an appointment will change everything when they failed to show up 
Well, they didn't want to be here, on to someone that actually WANTS to be helped 
And the cycle... continues 

Surely taking pills to numb me to force me to sit in emotional comatose will 
Cure me of my autoimmune disease that will end me prematurally anyways 
Find me nice stable jobs that can work around my frequent and random stays at the hospital 
Stop jobs from firing me for invalid reasons because of it 
And extinguish an innumerable amount of very real fires in my life that set me down this path in the first place

Even though I really really REALLY don't want to 
And it only hurts me even more 
permanently scaring the relationships that matter most to me 
never able to go back to how things were before 
inevitably helping me push myself to take the final jump

when they all finally shut me out

I feel stuck, Like an atom stuck on a plateau, trying to Fuse 
the only way to unlock my potential energy would be through quantum tunneling 
But you need to put outside energy in the system for it to work 
The only power that does work, is a firm grasping hand from ones we love the most, 
holding on with all their might despite the weight trying to sink ever deeper 
And the mightiest of tugs, going through that hill 
Holding on, as hard as they can, as they careen down the quantum waterfall in a burst of energy

They always leave.

"There are very few songs that strike a chord with my for being sad enough anymore? 

SO many songs are entirely about breakups and sadness surrounding that, but I'm not sad about that?

"My life, from an outside perspective, is objectively comfortable . I'm not terribly rich, but I have a roof over my head and food on my plate, with money to spare for my hobbies. I have a group of close supportive friends. 

I have depression. I've had it on and off since I was 11, but it's been consistently bad for the past year. Everyday is filled with excruciating pain and loneliness.
But I often wish it was worse. I'm ashamed to admit that I sometimes wish my parents died all of a sudden or that my house will burn down or that I'll get in a bad accident so that I'll receive public sympathy. I'll FINALLY have something concrete to complain about! Because guess what? Right now, I *don't* have much concrete things to complain about. At least not things I can tell people publicly.

I guess another way to put it is that I'm desperate for attention, although I don't like the connotation that comes with that phrase (as true as it may be). My head's constantly battling these dark thoughts. My life is a living hell, and I'm frustrated that nobody's taken notice, when it's my own damn fault I'm not opening up to anybody. 

Man... I'm just so tired. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up for. Everyday I think that this is the last straw. One of these days I'm going to collapse, but this time I won't be able to get back up...",5

"Hi. I'd rather not say my name, but I'm 15 and I've been like this since I was 11. I don't want to do anything anymore. Everything just seems... boring. I'm quite sick of everyday repetition. Wake up, eat, go to school, come home, eat again, then sleep. I've lost interest in all the games I thought were interesting before. Now it's just as dull as a pencil that hasn't been sharpened in a couple years. I don't want to do it anymore. My grades are dropping like the downwards part of a roller coaster. I hate everyone and everything. I hate them because they are disgusting. I hate them because they are annoying. I hate them because they do nothing to help. Everyone doesn't like me. They only tolerate me. They like to pick on me since I'm like this. They think it's funny if someone is a failure. Failures like me are disgraceful to everyone. I can't do anything right. I get yelled at by my mother for the smallest of things. I have religious propaganda pushed on to me everyday and it doesn't stop. I just need space. I want to feel the same spark of interest I felt when I was a little kid. Everyone thinks that I'm doing okay when they can clearly see that I'm internally suffering. I don't want to live anymore. Life was okay. Life was great. Hell, I'd even say that life was the best thing that happened to me. But life just started going downhill and it's still going lower and lower than it was before. If I killed myself all of my problems would go away. Everyone couldn't bother me anymore. Everything would be peaceful. I'd all be okay. I can't do it anymore. Everything is too stressful to deal with. I don't want to put up with this life anymore. It already sucks enough as it is. So why not just end it. I guess I'll just finish the things I had planned first. I just want things to be okay but they aren't going to be. If anyone wants to help me go ahead. I just want to be better.",5

I want to die, I haven't got a reason to live other than ruin my life. I've been told that I matter but the words don't mean anything when I've been told that I'm worthless and should give up. I've had to lie to my mum because I've been close to suicide multiple times. I turn 18 this year as well so then I'll be out of the support of my parents. I feel lost.

I got released a couple of days after that and it all felt apart. i'm failing my classes, i'm single now, i don't have friends, i got into a fight with my sister and now we don't talk, and i feel like shit all the time and i cant talk to anyone about it because i have no one. i feel like the only option is to kill myself.

"So depression sucks, it really does. The internal fighting of oneself, I'm just wanting it to stop. I'm not suicidal (this time) but other times it gets the better of me. This is the most candid I've ever been. I use to type long monologues into the google search bar of how I would like life to end, that would be the closest I come to speaking about my internal sadness. I would delete it along with my search history as I would hate for someone to view it and be concerned.

"My boyfriend and I have been in a long distance relationship since about five months now. We've known each other for much longer but just as uni started we realised that we wanted to date each other. Just recently, his close cousin died in a car crash. His father who passed away when he was about 14 also died in a car crash. Yesterday, I found out from his sister that he was in the hospital due to a car accident. Now presuming how much I knew that this accident affected him, I believe that he purposely did it. He kept telling me how he was going to do something stupid and how everything felt crazy on the inside and I kept telling him that I loved him and that I needed him. His sister and family will hardly reply to me when I asked what's going on and I don't know even know what situation he's in - dead, alive, coma?? It's eating me up inside and I don't know what to do about it. It seems like the best option is to just wait but that's too agonising for me. Should I try to get over him or wait till I know what's happened to him? I love him a lot but I'm unsure if he would be the same person after this and if we have an opportunity to live life together anymore. He's disappeared at times before and it's been every stressful for me- I break down constantly and don't eat until I'm starving. I know it sounds like our relationship is unhealthy but he has been nothing but perfect and loving and caring - I believed until recent that I was ready to spend my whole life with him. However, I can hardly help or contact him in situations like this and I feel like I'm wasting my uni life running after someone that I'm not sure I even know anymore. Despite that I know breaking up with him will hurt a lot because I thought that I was in it for the long run. I'm also doing medicine and I think this could greatly impact my degree unless I figure out what to do about it",4
I'm 16 and I have had frequent thoughts about dieing and killing myself. I think of new ways of doing it like cutting and hanging and stuff and have cut my self a lot.

"I've got my date set and all, but it can't come soon enough. I didn't anticipate looking forward to it, but I genuinely can't wait. When I first set it, I frequently became nauseous and dizzy thinking about my impending mortality, but as I get closer and closer to the day, the less worried and more ready I feel. It's becoming difficult not to discuss it with others or bring it up during conversations, especially because it's on my mind 24/7, it's the most remarkable thing that will happen to me probably ever. This probably sounds like an egotistical rant ""I, I, I, me, me, me"", but I do not care, for too long my life has been dictated by other people and factors out of my control and in my last 15 days, I'm gonna fucking focus on myself, nobody and nothing else matters to me now (when have I ever mattered to them?)",3
"I'm getting really bad grades in a class I used to be really good at. And in another class I'm being really disorganized losing sheets and not getting homework done on time. Truth is, Im exhausted from the moment I wake up so I'll just sleep when i get home, or I'll need to distract myself with a low effort activity rather than concentrate on homework to calm myself down from wanting to hurt myself. But I'm just lazy right? It's so frustrating being seen as careless when I'm just trying to survive. But my teachers expect me to get over myself because everyone goes through hard times. I'm already seeing a school counsellor who's not helping in any way and it's in secret because my parents wont let me see a proper therapist. Yesterday when I got 2 essays back I got E on both of them and I just wanted to tear my hair out because I'm trying so hard to balance everything out but it's not good enough. Seriously, all I can think about is killing myself and it's good enough that I actually come into school when I dont want anyone to see me because I feel too ugly, and I try to socialise with people and not zone out in class for like 8 hours. I just want everyone to know I have depression and help me out in any way but no. They dont give a shit. So I'll just fail and theyll never know why.",2
"So... I've wanted to kill myself for the longest. I've even made several failed attempts. I've prayed to God for death. For Him to take me in my sleep. And every morning after that, when I wake up, I cried because I still exist. I have grown to ultimately hate myself. I feel like the most trash ass human being...

When I try to express this to other people, it will either be met with the ""tough love"" reprimand, or I end up pushing that person away because of my negative energy.

I don't even know myself anymore. I don't have any more passion for things I once did (cooking, massage therapy). I attempt to develop motivation, but my depression and anxiety will team up with the PTSD I incurred from being robbed. When I notice negative self-talk, I'll try to change my thought patterns, but it always ends up back at ""The world would be better off if you were gone."" But I'm too much of a coward to try and take myself out again...

I just want to be happy, man. I want to be who I was before I figured out I was raised in CPS, who I was before being orphaned, who I was before being the state's property and another statistic.

Why the fuck am I still alive?",3
"I have been having more and more chest pains while I have a heart condition. I've been to the ER for it before but at this point as much as I want to live I don't think I'll ever be happy living. The more I've been thinking more about the world and people the more I realize how little control we have. We are attracted to people because that's who our environment and biology tells us to be attracted to, we do actions based on the same two things. As you can probably tell I'm a hard determinist. I don't believe anyone is special, I don't believe in love. Most days I have slivers of happiness but those slivers are over come with feelings of extreme loneliness. When I say slivers I mean a second or two followed by a dive into the abyss of sadness. Anyone I think I actually connect to leaves. I don't blame them either. I'm talking to this women who tells me that kissing for her is not cheating. I tried to understand why I would feel bad if someone I was with kisses someone else, is it my insecurity, is it my fear they will leave (under the umbrella of insecurity, I realize) idk. She tells me each connection you have is special but I'm thinking if they're all special, then, none of them are. And if this connection was so special why would the person sever it. I mean there might be a multitude of reasons but at the end of the day it becomes as if that â€œspecialâ€ person doesn't exist anymore. But, if y'all do manage to keep talking how does one person not feel the pain. I guess you both have to be in healthy relationships on your own (that could end at any moment) and have to not depend on a relationship. Isn't our end goal to produce viable offspring though. So wouldn't we be working, looking good, exercising all to make us an appealing mate. Is there any authenticity if you have no control over the people you bond with and they don't either. Is their anyone special out there to face the cruel oblivion with or are we, more so am I, destined to feel alone for the rest of my life. Ugh I hate this, I feel like shit and lonely but logic my way out of it but still feel like fucking garbage :( if we meet someone special shouldn't that be enough to make us happy, since some people never feel that. So we should be happy for being lucky, I mean I guess. Jesus, why can't I just be happy

"I'm fucking tired of people telling that everything will be fine and I feel like they're the ones that are ill for not seeing how fucked up the world is. Just look at this sub, every few minutes someone desperately looks for help and tells how miserable he or she is, sometimes without even being noticed. Now think of how many of all suffering people don't even seek for help because nobody gives a fuck, that's the human nature. It's just that it hurts. Even if someone ""wants to help you"" it's just because he or she will feel as a better person and then will leave you like a trash that you are so why even bother looking for help? Maybe depression is just a name created by people who are too scared of what reality is like. What if depression is perceiving the world as it is, while having good mental health means to disctract oneself from others pain? Or maybe I'm just talking shit, I don't even know what is real at this point. Fuck everything.",5

"Hi, I'm 15 years old. Currently been pulled out of school,due to many reasons, which is why I'm here so that I can clear my mind of any other thoughts that may lead me to things that I might regret later on. I'd like to share first my story so that no one would come at me.(ex. You're just 15, its just a phase. Pls stop doing this to get attention.etc) when I was very young I didn't really paid any attention whenever my father and mother would fought or when my sister( the 2nd oldest) would always ignore or would get pissed at me, because I thought that it was the norm. But things got worse when the whole family fought because of the sh*tty things my father had done and it all started because of me drinking a godd*mn cola, it went like this: ""who drank the cola?"" My father asked I was very scared so I didn't replied he asked that again and again until my mother told my father off, until they just started to shout at each other which forced my eldest sister to butt in, and the whole thing went to what my father did, such as adultery and bias. So it lead to my father pushing my mother, which pushed my sisters to fight my father, physically. I couldn't do anything but it really shocked me, and blamed myself for it. After the whole ordeal, it took 5 months to mend back the family. I thought finally, but I still had other problemsto face. I know that its stereotypical of me to say this but my asian parents(filipino) would always forced me to study when I never wanted any of this, I just wanted to play with other kids with no care in the world but I couldn't. My mothers way of teaching really left a toll on me cuz she would just hit me whenever I get the wrong answer or if I couldn't reply with the correct answer. I've always been the 2nd honor roll, but when she said this to me on the way back home ""pls don't drop your grades it would be really embarassing to my friends if you did"" that was jusy painful for me. others may think that I'm overreacting it was still really painful, tho I still couldn't speak my mind, I continued still, I was getting bullied as well for no reason. Years went by I was already in my first year of highschool in a prestige academy. I made friends, been respected, and I had little bumps in my grades but I still felt really great. Then one day one of my friends who is a guy told me to hang out with him, I couldn't tell that he had malicious intents. I was just really stupid. He cornered me ""can i touch your boobs?"" He said, I was shocked and refused but he was really strong and managed to touched me and resorted to attempted rape, afte I broke free, crying and running in the same day. I couldn't tell anyone nor my parent. So I just cried the whole night and proceeded to go to school and bearing to be with him in the same class. I had finally mustered up the courage to tell the guidance councelor, and due to that he got expelled and words got out because of the things he did and so I got harassed even more with the guys but I couldn't do anything and told myself to bear with it. I now entered my 2nd year of highschool which started the changes with me I became more irritated, a hot mess. I've been disrespectful to my mom, the reason we fight every morning. And another problem rosed up. A mistress of my father contacted me, I knew that she was just messing with me but I felt so angry. So I told my guidance counselor because I didn't know what to do anymore, so she told my mom and filed a case to my dads mistress, but the case got dropped because they said the account iwas fake when clearly it wasn't, I know I'm no professional but it was pretty obvious that it wasn't fake. I got even more mad because my mom didn't mind and told me it must be Gods plan (I'm christian but I'm not really on how my mother believes)now things really went downhill for me.I couldn't eat, I couldn't think of happy thoughts, I would just think of nothing, or everything is just useless even humanity, and that I wished I could just sleep and die from it. Things got even worse because my sister(the 2nd eldest), whenever I tell her shes wrong she would get mad at me,whenever I got mad at her she would get made at me, even tho she was in the wrong, but she was too prideful and wouldn't say sorry but I still did anyway. When things got even more hectic I started to hurt myself, my mom knew and told me angrily that I did it because of the internet. I couldn't take it anymore everything that I do is wrong, its like I'm the misfortune. I wanted to kill myself, which is why I went to the guidance counselor, and told my mom everything, so she pulled me out of school, and appointed me to a psychiatrist but the medicines was too much for me, in short it was painful, and it makes me go insane for some reason, and even messed with my diet(made me eat more). So my mom stopped me from drinking the pills, but the withdrawal was sh*tty too. I still get mad at everything and I really want to kill myself. I mean I don't know I'm still thinking of the pros and cons of me killing myself. Its just that I wish in my sleep someone would kill me. But I really wanna know if suicide is worth a shot, because I regret everything and I'm desperate( this isn't the whole thing sthst happened but its getting long that it)",4
"Started college 10 yrs ago. Was going to graduate soon but haven't been able to keep up w/ school since Jan. Depression, anxiety + giving up, self sabotage, isolating from friends/family. Can't seem to do anything. Feeling helpless, no motivation, angry, no confidence. Therapy and meds not helping. Have let everyone down including myself. What should I do?",2
"I literally cba to do anything anymore. It's a constant pain in my chest and I really really wish the attempted OD would've worked but I was too fucking into crying to go find more pills it should've been enough. I really really want someone to genuinely care about how I feel. For them to ask hey hru unprovoked no one does that then everyone says when someone kills themselves 'hey I didn't know they were feeling like that' I wrote a note and I just want to do it but I can't but I want and I will. That's the only thing I'm motivated to do. Force myself to commit suicide. Literary nothing helps and I'm sick of trying and I understand others are in this situation but I can't really take this cause I'm too weak for it.

Note: this is my suicide note, I don't know why I wrote it on Reddit I hope I come back one day and I'm able to say I didn't Kms but it doesn't seem likely right now I'm in a split of emotion.

"So I just talked to my parents today for the first time regarding that I want to get therapy. I just have a few questions (they may be hard to answer, so bare with me, I just want to know what to expect): 

1) idk if this makes sense, but some of my typical depressive thoughts seem to not be as accessible when i'm in a better (not happy though) mood. this makes it harder to talk about the underlying issues. could this be a potential problem?

2) what do they typically ask you on the first appointment?

3) if i've been really narrow-minded and close-minded to a lot of people around me trying to tell me to think more positive and eat more, etc., is therapy really best for me? would therapy be helping me become less stubborn and more open-minded?

4) for those who have gone through therapy, was it relieving to finally have the official diagnosis?

5) again, for those who have gone through/are going through therapy, what's the biggest change you've seen in yourself? it can be good or bad. 

thanks in advance!",1

"It's the worst catalyst to depression. Period. Remember all your problems? Now they are amplified. They feel worse because you feel like you have an escape in love but you don't and you never will. You start fantasizing over and over about the ""salvation"" of your life, the only source of possible happiness that you can imagine, and the more time passes the worse it gets. It hurts and it ruins your head it's either suicide or find salvation in that person. I've never hurt this much over fucking fiction. This person as I know it is in my head. I am in love with a person I created, I don't even know this person, just her exterior, yet I feel like I'm close to this person and it hurts not imagining a fake relationship. It hurts so fucking bad it feels good to think abandoning this world. No regrets. Why?
I am doing a favor to my crush and myself. Yet it still hurts I can't fall asleep. How does this make any sense? How strong is fictional love? Who is making me feel like this? I want to escape this hell. I already have crippling thoughts about my future and this just keeps coming up to me and it's so bad. So so bad.

But there was huge problem for me every time i thought about love or something similar i wanted to puke, no joke I almost puked way too many times, but after few days life became normal like usual.

Now i'm 20, after my hb I just stopped caring, I was really good student didn't even skipped school. But now I haven't been to school for 1,5 weeks. And the puking is coming back for no reason, but not as strong as it was. I feel like I lost motivation, fun and how to smile, getting worse vision, it's hard to concentrate on one thing. I'am getting easily exhausted, walking 2x slower than I usually did. I'm oversleeping no matter if i go to bed early, I still oversleep school. Also I'm listening to the one song like crazy obsessed, because it puts me at ease for some reason, even when i met up with my friends I still listen to the same song. Even when I'm going to sleep I listen to the same music. Don't know if it helps me or does it makes it worse. I started smoking 1 pack of cigs in a day, usually 1 pack of cigs lasted about 4-5days.

I feel emotionally unstable, like my eyes get teary for no reason. 


I think I have fever lately, and don't understand if it's hot outside or cold. 

Lately i been thinking it would be nice to not feel anything, like lock all the feelings, emotions. And have peace. If u know how to lock emotions tell me ;3

I have suicidal thoughts, bcz i'm ur typical normie but i'm hanging there by small thread, I don't have courage to do something to my body.

I had ""depression"" 1-2 years ago, talked to my bestfriend made it better and it was gone not long after that. but that was like lvl 1, now i feel like it's lvl 5. Oh u say talk to my bf agian, but last night when I went to him I was afraid to show my back, when he let me go first inside.

I don't wanna see any doctors, because if i actually had depression then it would only make it worse. (like totally im not afraid of seeing docs... I wouldn't even know where to go)

I hope somebody helps to get rid of that thread. TY.

Im struggling with depression and anxiety and ADHD symptoms, but the therapist that was supposed to refer me to a doctor to see about medicine hasnt done that yet. Its been almost two weeks and he hasnt returned calls or taken any steps at all to get me that medicine evaluation. I am not enough for my girlfriend. Not romantic enough. Not sexual enough.

"Hi, 

As the title suggests, where to go or how to help yourself where my options are severely limited?
My GP can only organise pills for me. I have no way of acquiring a therapist. I have been severely depressed for past couple of weeks and mildly since about November.

I don't have a trusted parent, sibling or a friend that I could open up to. I tried a while ago but I ask to support me in functioning day to day, pushing me to work and they just tell me they're sorry or they wish they could help. You know, the empty ""You can talk to me, it will get better"". Then they cut contact. My boyfriend just says he doesn't know how to help me and has phases of randomly complimenting me or texting me to tell me he loves me for two days straight then he forgets all about it. I'm sure he tries his best but I just wish I had more support and he says ""he can't help me anymore than he does"" everytime. I feel so trapped. I always have to pretend I'm fine. I always cover up with humor. It seems like I'm insincere or dramatic when I finally snap and just say I'm a mess. 

I can't afford a therapist. My university counselling office won't help me. They offered a suicide hotline numbers (?) and ""we're sorry but this isn't a psychological support that we do here"".

"Every day now for years, it's been exactly the same. Wake up, attend online school, get scolded by my teachers and parents for my poor grades and how slow I am, spend hours doing homework I struggle with, be overwhelmed and stressed about my life, cry and contemplate dying, go to bed, and repeat. On the weekends I'll either just sit in my room all day watching YouTube or nap all day because I can't even find the energy to get out of bed and do anything. I can't even find the will to finish my homework. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I don't have any skills, talents, or interests, and I can't even get a job since I live in the middle of nowhere and I'm terrified of learning to drive. I don't even really know anything about the real world. I'm just a husk of a person who rots in isolation in my room all day fantasizing about being dead. I am so desperately alone and I feel like a absolute worthless moron. My entire life I've literally never even had one friend. Every time in the past when I was going to public school and tried to make friends with people I always fucked up and made myself look idiotic because I never understood how to talk to people and form connections with them. I can't even make online friends. No one cares about me, not even my own parents. 

I just am so tired of trying to survive each day of hell by myself. I don't see how life can get any better when I'm already incapable of achieving anything. It doesn't help either that I'm so scared about the future. I don't know what I want out of my life, and even if I did, I'd have no idea how to get there with how far I've fallen behind everyone else and how unmotivated I am. I'm scared of fucking my life up even more than I already have. Maybe it'd be easier at this point for me to just drown myself to prevent having a depressing future where I'm suffering even more.

"Hey. 16M here. I'm just a wee little high schooler but I feel like I've been through a whole ass war with my own fucking brain. For context, my depression got intense at around 7th-9th grade. Finally it's started to slow down and I don't want to kill myself as much as I did in middle school. But not everything's is so hunky dory. I don't know if I'm alone on this and I doubt I am, but it's so hard to get motivated to do anything but play video games and smoke weed. Now I know I'll probably be told that the weed isn't helping with my motivation, which it isn't, but that isn't the issue. My issue is that I don't have any drive to want to better myself or to do anything other than what is fun to me. Am I alone here? Is this because of something other than my depression? 

I never do homework, I never study, and these days it's actually affecting all of my grades and that kills me because I could get away with doing *some* of my homework and get amazing grades on tests and 9 times out of 10 I'd pass with a C or above. But now I'm getting Fs in my classes and I just want to quit. I can't find a reason to continue being in this useless place we call school for my â€œeducationâ€.

I haven't been to therapy since 2014, and it was mostly for dealing with depression symptoms. Therapy helped me tremendously, and I felt better talking with complete transparency about my baggage with someone equipped to handle it. I went back recently and the interaction boiled down to them telling me 1) I was medicated at too young of an age (started SSRIs very young) and therefore my parents raised me incorrectly, and 2) Skepticism that the therapy ever helped me. He literally asked me, â€œdid that even help if you stopped going?â€

He told me his background was in social service, and he recorded the session for the school's records. He also told me that after this preliminary session he would refer me to a person with the proper training, but after our session ultimately decided he would take me on for appointments â€œI don't normally do this, but scheduling is too hard right nowâ€

"As the title says, my birthday is Saturday. The past 20 years I've never had a good birthday. My Mom was never stable, and my birthday was no exception. She'd would either view my birthday as a burden or if I didn't react in a specific way to something she would do for my birthday, she'd act as if the world collapsed around her and make a huge deal about how I don't appreciate her and she's a bad parent. (Maybe I'm just un-greatful like I've always been told) Regardless. As far back as I can remember, I've never had a good birthday. I recall vividly having a birthday party as a child, no one wanted to really play with me at my party. And I tried to isolate myself at a table when the cake was being cut (it didn't go over well with my Mom, she scalded me in front of everyone).

As birthdays go by, all I remember are sighs, moans, and groans whenever mentioned. Last year no one wished me a happy birthday (family yes, but if history shows they don't really care) my Mom said I should celebrate her on my birthday because she's the one that gave birth to me.
Later on I went to a pub I knew I could get into, and tried to get drunk but could barley manage. I had never felt so alone in a room of people, and it's not like it's a place I'm unfamiliar with, I knew the regulars, the regulars knew me, we're all well aquatinted. Yet still, I had never felt more alone. I ended up contacting a mate that sells me pot and got high with my weed guy. He's the only person that genuinely wished me a Happy Birthday outside my family.

Flashforward to present day, life is pretty decent, my business is doing well, I have an album releasing soon, I have a clean bill of health (for the most part) but the realization set in...

My friend (we'll call him J) is talking in the group chat I'm in, saying he wants to do social stuff soon, and I tell him that (we'll call him B) B and I are going to do stuff Friday and we could go out and do something all together. The chat goes cold. 

Time passes. 

Moments later, someone else in the chat (we'll call him C) says ""we should all do something Friday""...everyone lights up with agreeing with him. B then enters the chat and says my birthday is Saturday and ""we should be going out Friday for Matt"". C responds with ""that's fine"". Then everything hits me, I feel like a burden again, they probably didn't want to hangout with me, and now that B said something they feel obligated... 

I told them ""We don't have to for me"" ""I would rather you guys have a full night"". The chats been silent since. I'm a burden, people probably hangout with me because they feel morally obligated. I'm just a waste of space.

I'm probably being over dramatic and acting like a child seeking attention. But I know this post will waste away in the void. Nothing is genuine. I'll always be lonely.",5

But now i know they pity me and think im a defect produced by their parenting. 

If anyone i know finds this, please know its not your fault. I will never hate anyone more than myself. Im a coward. ive always known. To my brother, i want you to have everything i own. You can choose to throw it away or give it away. The plushies can go to dad, the makeup can go to mom. The clothes can be sold. The rest is yours. Im sorry i couldnt be the sister you admire

Thank you to everyone who inspired me and encouraged me to live on. Im sorry. Its not your fault. Its all mine.


edit: my parents heard me crying and talked to me. my mom says my problems are small and i should have a strong heart. My dad denied saying that stuff. i knocked myself out with sleeping pills but today i cant go anywhere without supervision so i guess im still alive. thank you everyone who replied, reading all of it made me cry a lot... none of you know me but you talk to me with kindness... its crazy... thank you for being here thank you",1
"My heart is screaming, my soul (and my right arm due to self harm) is bleeding and burning, I am feeling lower and lower each day that passes, I feel more and more like I will explode, several personnal reasons caused me to feel this way (sexual bias, poverty, loneliness, studies, ill relatives, I am also possibly underdiagnosed when it comes to my mental health) but I don't know how to ask for help.

I don't know what to say, and I would feel guilty saying this to the people around me because I will bother them. 

I told it to my best friend but she is suicidal and severely depressed and she started to self harm again after I told her I self harmed and I don't want to make her feel worse. I want to support her although I don't have the strength to do that. I told it to a friend and to my sister as well and although they are helping and kind, I don't want to tell them how bad I feel. I don't know how to.

I tried to see psychologist but I have to wait untill at least april. This is a free psychologist and I can't afford to see another one earlier if it means I have to pay. My credit card has been stolen anyway lol.

Anyway, my way of coping with all of this is to put myself in danger and make myself feel physically bad in the hope I will feel more valid in my suffering and that I will finally be able to ask for help and feel like I deserve it. 

Does someone else feel this way here ? 

Thank you for reading my messages, and sorry for my english.",3
"I use to drink often, I stopped. I'm very intoxicated so I might be all over. Shit happens right. 

I've been depressed for so fucking long it hurts to think about. At 13, 16, 19 everyone says it'll get better. I'm 23 and nothing's gotten any better.

I had a 3 year relationship and she threw me to the curb. I had a 2 year relationship following (after a break from the 1st, we only dated a year but were close/fuck buddies for a year leading to it) and we broke up tonight, fun fact we still live together until july. My depression doesn't stem from relationships, there's a plethora of things contributing to it. I think I'm out of my depth on this one. We were fuck buddies because I didn't want another relationship. I didn't want to give someone a chance to hurt me again. 

She was moving for school and I couldn't bare the thought of losing her so I asked her to date and we planned and did move in together.
I've punched myself in the face because it's less damaging then cutting myself. I think at this point if I self harm it'll be the end. I promised myself that long ago though I didn't follow through the last time I started cutting myself. This time I think I would, one pump of adrenaline is all it would take then I wouldn't be hurt anymore. 

I left all my friends for her, I moved an hour away for her. I dont see a point in living, I dont see a point in eating or sleeping. 

I dont know what I'm expecting fro. This honestly, I have noone but my sister and I hate being a burden on her (though tonight she may have kept me here). I know how I'd do it, it would be a 10 minute trip to get what I need. I dont want to but I have nothing and noone. No friends, out.of my family only my nana and sister talk to me. I've texted my dad yesterday and today about a car issue and that's the most we've talked in 2 days than I can remember. Usually it's around 1 a month, sometimes more sometimes less.

I'm a burden on everyone. I think the world would be a better place. All I can think about is putting a knife against my throat and givin' er. 

Relationships didn't cause this, certainly attributed. No friends, no family, noone to hurt if I die. I dont know what I was hoping to accomplish with this post but I think its pushed me farther towards doing it.

I hope you have a good day, thanks for taking a few minutes to read my messy/suicidal thoughts.

Tldr: have a good day.",4

"ive been clean from heroine for 2 weeks, and even since the unbearable pain of withdrawals have passed, the mental emptiness has not, and might not for a very long time. like many of you, i still think about ending my life every day. 

2 days ago, i was out on my porch, writing a suicide note. seemingly, getting the last rays of sunshine i would ever feel. I was content with that. Then, I heard my phone ringing. Who the hell is calling me on my last day here. 

My best friends twin sister had been diagnosed with Leukemia. Think about your BEST friend, and how their pain, is often yours, as well. I mean, why wasn't I already on my way to grab my car keys and see him and his family? 

After a few grief-stricken hours spent with them, I headed back home. Then, I realized; for a whole two hours, did I really just forget about fucking killing myself?

The one thing that took me out of my thoughts of death were simply thoughts about someone else. And it helped me realize why I ended things with heroine, and not with my life. 

I'm not one to know whether it is healthy or not to love someone more than you love yourself. All I know, is that a phone call from my best friend stopped me from killing myself. The circumstances of why he called me reminded me of the importance of me still being alive. Anyone who has experienced something like this, I encourage you to not see these instances as coincidences, but as testaments to the fact that you are meant to still be alive.

I don't really know how to wrap this up. I just hope you all know how much you really matter. Because now, I remember how much I matter. I know this won't help everybody, but I hope it will help somebody.

I am the scilent smart kid in class that always get good grades butt also i am not the tipical nerd in class that doesnt do anything but learning no I am in 7th grade and I have a class that is called science but it what i do now is make anything over a bicicle to race with.(It is for the looks) I have a boy who also does that class and we are sort of friends. butt he makes comments like: ""Sytse (my name), You ruined everything."" I really dont like that sort of comments because i am soccially really unstable. I have been trough a lott the last couple of years because my little sister(3 years younger than me) was alway angry. That really effected me. Also other classmates will kick me and i know it is al yokes en stuff but i really dont like that and i haven't been happy for a long time. when i am home is it also always that i am really tired. The only things that give me energy are drawing alone locked up in my room and watching youtube wit h my earbuds in. it also doesnt help that my little sister is really adhd or something. i mean REALLY ADHD. it isnt normal. and i cant have any attention because she always has something my parents have to see. My parents are the best, dont get me wrong butt i really dont know what to do. also i havent shared this story to anyone ever. my parents tell me that i seem depressed. It hasnt been proved yet but i am just not happy all the time. Not in school, not at home. the only thing that gives me some sort of energy is drawing. i can do that all day long.

I've been told it's normal with depression to be confused with your feelings but I don't know what my emotion is I can't pin point it unless I'm super depressed because then I know I'm super depressed but while I'm not I don't know what I am or who or what I'm feeling I feel like a liar and that I'm faking everything but I know I'm not.,0
"I don't want to self diagnose but i feel like i might have depression. I've had severe lack of interest in activities, emotional numbness, suicidal thoughts, and other stuff for the past 2 months or so. And during this time last year it was the same thing but it lasted nearly 6 months before i started to feel okay. But i know that depression can make you unproductive and drop your grades, but my grades in school are still really good (its still hard to concentrate in class i just understand subjects on my own) and i do daily tasks like showering and cleaning. So it doesn't really affect me academically but socially it does. Is this still depression?",5

I just dont think that I can ever have a functional relationship because of how bad my depression is. Also, I think that people get bored of me and see me as worthless sometimes. It really just hurts because I really feel worthless. Sorry this is all just complaining. I am just so hurt right now and I feel hopeless. Like I am not going to go anywhere in life.

"So when your child's suicidal, self-harming, chronically depressed, and suffering bias while you're away from the house, the obvious solution is to tell her that she's lying about everything and just needs to study harder because grades = good degree = good job = no more depresso. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wow. Genius, dad. I just need to stop FEELING and study my ass off. It makes so much sense. Why didn't I think of that?

&amp;#x200B;

And when I'm on the balcony crying and so close to jumping and you change the subject to this semester's grades again, I guess that's good too! Of course, grades are all that matter. 

&amp;#x200B;

And mom, I guess hating your child for being broken by your bias is logical too! I mean, how dare I make you feel bad by crying and trying to hang myself after you shook me and screamed in my face and told me I was no longer in the family? That's just what a child deserves for saying she doesn't love you! You're so damn right!

"A bit of context. I'm an American. I'm black. I'm big. I'm ugly. And I'm autistic. I work as an aircraft mechanic.

The more I go through every day, the less I see the point of continuing with this life. No one who's gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. People make fun of my quirks all the time - they think they're being funny, but they're being obnoxious. Besides that, the only friends I still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. My father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while I was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him.

Besides that, people will only connect with me as much as they need to. I clearly have problems that I do not know how to address. No amount of therapy has fixed those issues.

People cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. Society here in general doesn't like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. I know that I won't ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because I'm likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. I've been racially profiled many times when I lived in New York City. I happened to be stopped for every ""random"" drug search whenever I took the Staten Island ferry while carrying a backpack.

That being the case, the only value of any sort I can provide to society is in the job I do. I'm also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day I'm questioning more and more why I care. More money isn't going to fix me as a person.

The truth is, I'm a mistake. I learned a few years ago that I was adopted at birth. Probably before my new parents knew I would be as difficult as I was. I should've been aborted or left to die.

The prognosis for our world grows more dire every day due to global warming facilitated by old people who don't give a shit about us. There is no reason to believe things will get better - people reject science more and more, and we are going backwards.

Before long, I will have a gun. It will allow me to protect myself where I know law enforcement won't. But it'll also give me the power to choose when I want to die. That, at the very least, will give me peace of mind - knowing I have a way out whenever I need it.

I'm not some ""starving kid in Africa"" or whatever other bullshit people push to those who are discontented, but I have still been dealt a pretty shitty hand in life. I see no reason to keep bothering with it when so many things are wrong with me, and our future will only get worse.",1

I can't work during PA school because my days are 15 hours long including class and nonstop studying. I am never going to be good at anything.

"I'm at a cross roads. Yesterday, I had a mid term and showed up 50 minutes late. I had actually gotten up that morning to go and take it (my mom took the car extra early and came back late even though I told her that I needed to be at school). Unfortunately this didnt help the fact that I havent been attending school or doing the hwks and labs. My programming professor understood and gave me the slip to go back to do the labs and hwks that I missed. Though again, yesterday I was told that I'm approaching the deadline for this consideration very close and was suggested to take a medical withdrawal by my professor. This year just isnt my year. I feel withdrawn from everything and just cant bring myself to hold onto the shread of stability. Me missing my classes is also something I told my therapist and psychiatrist about. 

My professor wants to hold a meeting with me and my academic advisor to see if there is a way to avoid medical withdrawal and catch up on assignments. I appreciated the consideration until early today, when I realized that I most likely wont be attending lab today either. I cant keep doing this. This is the second time I've taken this class and its gotten admittedly worse. The first time was alright but this time...is terrible. I dont have a support group like last time and I dont have a team. My first time, I was turning in assignments but the lack on my part was not studying for the midterm but I still had a long stride of actually passing then. I feel so uncomfortable in class, I feel like a foreigner. I get sad because it's as if I have no idea what's going on around me and it makes me so sad. 

I have a sibling who faced this problem when she tried attending college. She got depressed, started sleeping in and never leaving for school. I dont know why we cant stay in college and actually graduate but it seems like a curse. 


If I leave school, I'm faced with having to leave my school job. If I lose my school job, I wont have any funds. My mother will be leaving me in our hometown and I wont be able to get help from her like I need . I know that if i withdraw, i wont be able to withdraw from one class, I'd have to leave all of them. I didnt have the best if luck from finding work without school ties. So, I'm scared to leave school. I'm diagnosed with depression and GAD. I'd be anxiety ridden and depressed knowing that I'll be holding my grad year back and I wont be able to conjure up funds. 

I wanted to love school. I know I can love learning but I cant seem to love that or anything else right now. I was supposed to be graduating this year but I souldnt be anyway due to needing more classes to complete. I had planned on passing this semester and taking up extra summer classes go shorten time but ...that's all gone. 

I dont know what to do. Should I schedule this meeting in hope of finding options where I dont withdraw and end up pissing away at the possible opportunities? Or just withdrawal, be possibly homeless and come back to school when I'm better? Its hard making a living without a college degree and im worried. I want to stop the self sabotage of depression but it's as if I can't.


I don't want to leave my home. I want to stay home all the time . I told my counselor this and it's as if she doesnt really get it. She makes it seem as if it's an easy fix and then I wont do it again. I hate the therapists I've had because they are very ineffective. I had one who turned out to be a child psychiatrist and she was a thousand times better but for some reason I cant see her in our facility any longer.",2
"Hi, depression is something I've been dealing with off and on for at least 15 years. I'm 33 married with two young kids, I come from a family with parents who want to be supportive but do not really understand depression and mental health problems. It's made worse by the fact my two younger siblings are already more accomplished than I am. Anyways I've been in therapy 3 times over the last 15 years and quite honestly it's been a disaster each time, I'm to the point where I no longer believe in psychotherapy as a legitimate means to help myself.

This recent bout has started late October and has been moving into the severe, life affecting depression the last two months. It's made much worse by having to look my wife and precious children in the eyes everyday knowing I'm failing them. My wonderful children 2.5 and 1 year old bring me so much joy but then so much anxiety that I am failing them, wasting my life in a malaise with no real impending problems. 

Probably the worst part is people who know me but don't live with me would never know this, even when depressed I can fake it in social situations and I would say people think I'm funny, personable and when I'm not depressed I have a keen mind and have had some mild success in business or other endeavors. So people would be shocked to read or hear how tortured I feel mentally. 

Like an idiot I fell into old traps, trying to just â€œtake the edge offâ€ with a couple drinks in the morning just to get through the tough times, Which the veteran depressed reading this will be shaking their heads knowing how much worse that makes it. Luckily I recognized it early enough and cut it out cold turkey and haven't had a sip in 10 days or so. Right now I just need some inertia to get out the door, run my small business and provide for them. Today is the worst I've felt in years, paralyzed by my demons, it's absolute agony. 

Becoming a father has been the best thing that's ever happened to me, but if I fail my children and wife I'll never ever forgive myself. I need to face things head on but it's that fear of what damage I've done the last few months being negligent and having to once again dig myself out of this hole. You see I know more major bouts of depression are in my future but I worry how many more recoveries I have in me, I make life so hard on myself with the inconsistencies, it's such torture. 

Thanks for giving me a forum to say this.",3

"I'm a teenage boy, soon 18 years old and I am not doing well at all.

Most tragic thing that keeps bothering me on daily basis is that few months ago me and my exgirlfiend were still in a happy relationship. I saw myself sharing a future with her. I might have committed too much in the relationship, because it was something I always relied on. We had this weird phase of not talking much before breaking up. She constantly said she was busy with school work, family and hobbies. I believed her. She is a very work active person. One day, about few weeks ago she called me and said she thinks she is gay. I was heartbroken obviously. I still am. She has been seeing this girl a lot too. I cant stop thinking about the ''what ifs''. What if she was secretly cheating on me? What if she never even loved me? What if she dated me out of pity for 2 whole years? I can barely sleep at night thinking about this.

Not only am I going through a rough heartbreak, I am also struggling with quite severe loneliness. It is hard for me to admit, because I enjoy being alone, but it does make sense that I am seriously lonely. Few months ago I stopped going to school and after consulting with teachers we decided that it is the best for me to do school work from home. I never leave the house to go see friends. Hell I don't even think they want to see me. I am pretty sure if I just ended my life not many people would even remember me. My online friends cant even play video games with me, which would mean a lot if I could for once just do something fun with other people.

I am currently seeing a therapist. She has seen me at my worst. I never told her I was suicidal, but I'm sure she might know that already. My only solutions I can think of to get out of this hell is medication and waiting for some kind of a miracle to happen. If that doesn't work I really cannot see myself making it to my 20s or 30s. It sucks because I do want to live, but living with depression, loneliness, anxiety, heartbreak and all that kind of bs doesn't sounds worth it to me. I am going to end up being even more lonely soon once I move out. In a way that is good, because once I end it all even less people will be sad over it. I wont hurt others by going away.",4

My parents who are both narcs all of a sudden want to start being caring and started telling everyone who asked the reason I attempted suicide was because I got rejected from my top university choice - it really and truly was NOT the reason I felt like I needed to die. 

I tried telling one of my friends about my attempt, and I mentioned in passing that I had my stomach pumped. She started asking me what it feels like and whether or not they replace the substance removed from your stomach like it was fucking cool or something. It was just insensitive. 

I can't bare the awkwardness. I just feel very trapped and everything just feels so strange. I don't know what to do and everything just feels so fucked up. I don't want any special treatment. I just want life to return to the way it was.",2
"It will get better for you, the person with more than a handful of friends worried for you and asking if you'll be okay, the person who actually has a significant other who you can always turn to, the person who has a community that accepts them and doesn't discriminate against them for their entire identity. The person who only has depression and not a literal learning disability that impacts how you interact with others, and they treat you horribly because of it. The person who's pretty or at least average looking but at least they don't have a disfigured face people avoid as soon as they see you.

If you're all of those. Or at least one. It'll always get better for you. And I am none of these!

So I don't want to hear ""life will get better"" because it fails to take account to the people who have nothing and who's been like this for years. That's me!! This is how it'll be for the rest of my life, no matter how hard I try to make it better nothing sticks. It always goes back to the status quo. Misery!

I'm so fucking done! I'm going to kill myself tonight, and there's literally nothing anyone can do that will stop me.",1

I feel like I'm dying every single day. I just can't stop thinking. Every single time I make a mistake I can't forgive myself and I spend hours each night thinking about it. I barely have any reasons to live. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm sorry if I bothered you.,0
"I don't wanna specify my age, but I'm young. Because of this my mom thinks that I'm faking and won't accept it.

Even when I tell my school counselor that I just don't want to be alive anymore and they send police to my house to check up on me, my mom won't believe me. Even when I tell her to at least get a doctor to diagnose me, she won't, 

As previously mentioned, the place came to my house and they suggested that I might want to get a therapist. My mom said ok yeah sure whatever. A week later and I remind her. She says yeah I'm on it, another week goes by and my mom tells me that she just doesn't want to pay for something that I'm probably faking for attention. 

All this is just making it worse.

I'm tired of being kicked out and biasd by the people I rent a place to stay from and to top it all off the guilt of seeing my dad pay for my living space in a shitty place because I can't get a job because every interview ends with, ""we would have hired you if you had a degree"" even though I always tell them before hand that I'm currently studying in my university and that I'm staring my 5th semester now. I only need two years for my degree and I'm willing to work long unfair hours but they still won't take me. I have been put on the back burner while my biasrs live a lavish lifestyle. All because my dad chose them over their victims. The biasr has a master's degree but won't even get a job because my dad pays for them. I can't even get a job! I'm tired and defeated.

"I know it's better to see an expert rather than stranger on the internet but I've been to 2 therapist and they haven't helped. 
I'm 23, male, fit and healthy, come from a good upper middle class family who support me well and I really have no hard struggles to deal with. Despite all this since about the age of 10 I've wished I was never born and would rather be dead. Really the only thing keeping me from suicide is that I don't want to put my family/ loved ones through that pain. This may be decent enough to keep me alive but still isn't much of a viewpoint to live from, there are times I resent my family because I have to endure the pain and stress of life just because of them. 

I would just much rather be dead than go through the stress of living and working for the rest of my life, call it depression or laziness or whatever but it's just my viewpoint in life and I can't shake it. 
Does anyone out there have a similar mentality and have ever thought or been told anything to truly shift them out of that mindset? Therapy has never done anything to help me shift out of this and I almost feel like it's too much of a therapist to be able to do so.",5
"And again, i'm laying in bed crying. i feel like a failure. i can't save money, i don't have a degree in anything, i can't drive, i don't have my own place. i quite literally live in a basement. a shitty one at that. 
i could move with my dad but that would mean living on the same property as the man who molested me for half my life. Wasn't my dad, but my step grandfather. 

i'm losing a will to keep going more and more. i'm tired of being belittled by so many people in my life. i just wish i got more support in real life and not just online. i mean i love the support but i just really want to be praised and told that everything is going to be better by someone in my life. i crave it but i don't get that instead i always get knocked down",5
"Just been in a really bad place mentally I'm grateful for all the little things I have in my life.
But the odds are stacked against me and I can't even think straight or even focus in uni or even drive properly. Everyone else has a better life than me I know I should stop complaining and just try to make things better for myself but that's so much easier being said than done. I've tried everything but nothing has worked for me . I see the guy that my girlfriend cheated on me with he laughs right at my face just a spit on my face to show what a failure I am. 

Sorry for all the self loathing but I just have no one to talk to. Might just drive my car off the bridge tonight",4
"I'm convinced that antidepressants don't do shit. I've been on bupropion, sertraline, risperidone and citalopram. None of them feel like they do anything. From the day I started taking them, I never felt the slightest effect. No dizziness, sleepiness, wooziness, grogginess, horniness, happiness, sadness, gassiness or any other ness. Nothing to indicate that they work. They're placebos meant to trick people into thinking they're working.",3
"I've been in a very relaxed relationship since September but ever since january things have been ""on the wall."" During winter break, especially after the holidays, she became a lil bit distant to me. We eventually talked and she wanted to be apart for awhile due to personal issues with herself and I understood and we went from a relationship to just best friends. We have talked about her issues before so I told her I will always be there for her and she insisted she didnt want things to change or grow apart. We were in a very adult relationship so I didn't want to ruin or friendship, we eventually became close and things were all the same as they were before we broke up. Lately though she has been going through things again and I am having a hard time getting through it this time. Last time I took it very mature and was actually the only relationship I have actually not completely fallen apart after the break up. This time I'm thinking it's just me though and my own low self esteem has caused issues more than anything. I barely get a text from her and we never get to hang out and it really hurts, more than anything I have every felt before. This has resulted in me doing things I have never done before that I feel ashamed of, caused me to take up nicotine again, and major other issues resulting in my school work in college to be a burden rather than something to help me. Sorry I just needed to get some stuff off my chest and things and I hope she never sees any of this. She is an absolute gem and I want to be the one to be there for her as much as I can but I feel like she is hiding from me at times and doesnt want to even deal with me anymore. The only part that give me hope and joy is when I see her in class and we talk and joke, and then I kiss her good bye and I dont see her for another few days. It's just alot of pain to see someone I care about so much just dissapear from my life like this. Or atleast it feels that way if I'm not over thinking it. Sorry guys!",4
"I am in the worst situation I have ever been in as I am about to become homeless. I returned to the UK after living abroad 5 months ago and things seemed promising at first however things went downhill pretty quickly. Finding a job has been a nightmare - i have decent experience and have had a lot of interviews but everywhere either ghosts me or rejects me. I get rejected a lot because I ""dont show I want the job enough"" but years of BPD and depression mean I find it incredibly hard to show my emotions. One company rejected me for this reason after 4 rounds of interviews!

On top of that, I was with a gambling addict a few years ago who made my life hell and created all kinds of debt for me (signing up to websites with my details, getting loans out in my name). Completely my fault for sticking with him so long but he has left me with Â£12,000 approx worth of debt so of course I am being chased on those debts too. I am also not entitled to any benefits. 

So finally I have ran out of money and am 2 months behind on rent, I let my rental company know today and was pretty honest about my circumstances (I said it was because of redundancy as it's less embarrassing). We agreed I will move out this week, not that I was expecting any sympathy but the lady at the rental company was a dick. So now I am homeless - I am not pregnant or super young or super old or anything like that so the chances of me getting any help are pretty much zilch. 

I am leaving behind the most amazing boyfriend that I never thought I would find and that's why there is so much guilt. I think deep down I am leaving this message in the hope one day he sees it and knows there is nothing he could have done. I have tried talking to him about this but he thinks I am just having a BPD episode and am exaggerating. There is no way he can help anyway he certainly couldn't help me financially (nor would I expect him to!) and he lives in the same house so staying with him isn't an option. 

My main wish is that him and my friends will be OK eventually and will understand that I am in a much better place!",2

Living through this hell, where i cant concentrate because i have intrusive thoughts so bad, i NEED something to take my mind off of the thoughts. And my parents tell me im not allowed to tell a doctor, because the intrusive thoughts could endanger my planned out medical career. Life has become too much to bear and i cant take it. Ive become so stressed my eye has started to twitch almost every time i blink. I cant escape, and not even suicide is an answer anymore. It doesnt help that it feels like everyone god damn hates me. Any mistake i make, i always have a thought like ""wow, that person probably hates me now"" and i cant live with my own thoughts. When ever i dont have a distraction, my mind starts saying violent stuff i dint agree with, but it says it in my voice, making me think im fucking crazy. Maybe i am fucking crazy.

"I've felt this way for a very long time. The feeling of inadequacy, the contempt of others, the anger, and the overwhelming loneliness. For such a long time, I've kept it bottled up, but now its beginning to boil over and I don't know how to handle it. This is my first time admitting to this and I think its easier to admit in anonymity than to my family. They wouldn't understand these feelings and I inevitably chase all of my friends away. I have no hobbies or anything that I am good at so I just wallow in my sadness. I dont want to be so absorbed in my own issues but its hard to overlook when it begins to bleed over into the things I used to care about like school. Being alive has never been a feeling that I can remember feeling happy about.I've come to live with pain and failure but I would just like the feeling to stop and feel even a modicum of ""okay-ness."" Despite everything, I cant say I'm better off and I simply do not want to deal with any of it anymore to be honest. I really want to get better and i hope that this is the first step to that for fear of the alternative.",5
"There's this thing that circles around my feed every once in a while, about how Eeyore is feeling low so he stays at his house instead of going out with Pooh and Piglet, so Pooh and Piglet go to his house, where Eeyore says he's not been hanging around with them because he's sad and low and not much fun to be around. So then Pooh and Piglet sit next to Eeyore and don't say anything, they just lend him their presence, with love and without judgment. And then, although he doesn't feel better, he \*does\* feel better.

I've got people like that, people who have straight up offered just to sit with me, who don't care how low I am or how un-fun I am to be with, they just love me. But the thing is, the thought of having someone just sit with me while I am dying inside -- I mean, I seriously can't even bear it. As much as I would be willing to do that for someone else, I simply cannot accept being on the receiving end of it.

What is that? It would be such a comfort to be so wholly accepted, to be so free of expectations and disappointment and pressure; but I can't even imagine it without spinning out.

"ive been having a horribly depressed episode for the past 6 monthsâ€” i am not diagnosed but ive been dealing with casual symptoms of depression for my whole life (im 18).
i finally went to my doctor in january and she gave me a referral to a psychiatrist, but wait lists here are long and its been over a month and i havent heard anything. ill probably be waiting much longer and that thought feels like torture and makes me feel worse.
im self harming, but i personally dont think its at an alarming level. there was about a month long period when i was **actively** suicidal, had a plan, a date, and the tool to do it. obviously i didnt follow through. the thought of suicide still lingers in my mind but its more low-key now...
when i was actively suicidal i was considering voluntary hospitalization. i know that route would get me treatment much quicker.
right now i feel like thats my only option with my current situation... i dont know if this is selfish, but i cant bare the thought of waiting much longer for treatment when ive been having on and off depressive episodes my whole life, and i believe im in the middle of my worst one yet right now.
but i feel like i dont deserve inpatient care since im not actively suicidal or â€œat riskâ€ of causing serious harm.

I just ask for one thing: i want to die.

im the kind of person that cant say no, and try my best to help everyone and to look nice to everyone but i feel so lost inside, i cant make choices. im just doing what that 'voice' keeps telling me but everytime i feel like im getting lower and lower. i've already planned everything for my suicide and if things wont get better, ill just do it. i have nothing to lose. 

sometimes i wish i could have a soul I can ally with to beat that voice... im just lost. i wish maybe something could help me, anyone... help me make decisions. idk i've always been so lonely, and i have big problems socializing because of this 'voice', i might have friends that love me but i feel like im just nothing, and THAT 'voice' just keeps pushing me away from them and from everyone. i try to make new friends, meet lots of people but in the end i feel bad and i end up ignoring everyone and staying hostage of that 'voice'.... i dont get it because when im with people and all i dont seem to be strange or anything i try to tell things so people notice i have problems but in the end im just closing myself with my own thoughts and cant seem to try anything to beat myself on my own game....

I don't really know where to begin but suicide is something I have been thinking about constantly. I don't want to wake up, I don't want to be anywhere or with anyone, and I don't even want to sleep anymore and that's the only thing that would numb my depression (because I wasn't awake to feel it). I feel so incredibly lost and I can't help but to want so badly to end it all. I keep wishing something would push me over the edge enough to give me the strength to finally kill myself. Everything's just so dark and honestly I could go on forever but my brother-in-law just walked in and I have to pretend like I'm okay again so I guess I'll stop there.

"I took an IQ test on queendom and got a score of 112. That puts me at or near one standard deviation below the engineering fields. The science fields are probably close to that as well. I feel like this is a result of my genetics, my economic background, and my lack of learning things throughout life. This IQ would qualify me to go into Accounting, IT, or the trades but I don't want to be sitting at a desk all day or getting dirty. I want an occupation that allows me to have a mixture of being outdoors and being at a desk or lab.",2
"So Iâ€˜m a bit excited about writing a post about it. Iâ€˜m struggling from severe depression since Iâ€˜m 11. Iâ€˜m also not the one whoâ€˜s crying over things happened in the past. It's about my condition Iâ€˜ve been living with the last years and want some advices about how to finally be able to handle it.

Everyday I wake up with great dissatisfaction. Always in a bad mood. No motivation at all. Always tired and sleepy and feeling totally lost. Iâ€˜ve lost interest in nearly everything - drawing, music, singing... Not knowing what to do, I fear the future ahead of me. I was once totally into Design... thought this is what Iâ€˜m going to do. However, Iâ€˜ve also lost the interest in it. It was a gradual change and I can't even explain why it happened since I was always passionate about it. 

Now Iâ€˜m sitting there - day by day - everything is annoying, not interesting anymore, not worth it and stressful to me. I feel like I fell into an Abyss with my head full of negative thoughts. I don't know who I am neither am I satisfied with how the situation isn't changing. I tried meditation once. It was a good experience. But Iâ€˜m not even in the mood to continue what might help me out of this situation. The only thing I'm currently doing is just playing games the whole day so I won't be confronted with all those bad thoughts flooding my mind.

Don't get me wrong. I'm really grateful for what I have. Being able to sleep on a bed, having enough food and embracing the small things in live. I don't like it fancy. I just want to find happiness and being able to laugh again. 

Does someone experienced the same? What did you do to get out of it?",5
Just sick of having to wake up everyday and live a life I don't want to live. Im no where close to where I want to be in life and i have no idea how to get there. And that would have been alright if I could at least be myself with people I like. But i cant even be myself because my body dosnt belong to me it belongs to everyone else except me. I just want to dye my hair pierce and tattoo my body but I cant do that because im a piece of shit that cant do anything right. Im a grown ass adult whole still can't fucking drive or have a job or even firends I can talk to. I have no one I can talk to I couldn't even text the sucide hotline or contact a school counselor because my anxiety make me want to peel my skin off when I try. I feel trap in a never ending cycle and sometimes it feel like death is the only solution but I'm too scare to do it. And people keep saying it going to get better but its not always the case. And i dont think thats the case for me. At best things would just be alright but it will never be great.,1
"You guys ever been tossed aside like last month's trash? Not a great feeling, especially when you already feel fucking worthless. My particular instance of this is made even worse by the fact that this situation arose from a douchebag throwing tons of money at the target of my affection. 

I don't know where the money comes from, but it's in large enough quantities that I have a suspicion the douchebag in question has some rich parents and hasn't earned any of this affluence himself. It's a real piss-off. 

I suppose what I should take away from this situation is that the girl in question is a money-grubbing whore. When I did have some disposable cash she was really sweet and affectionate. Not anymore since this fuckface entered the scenario. I'm really fucking fed up with this. 

I guess I need to just move on and write this girl off as what she's presented herself to be now, an entitled, money-obsessed bitch. 

Any insight would be helpful.",5

"I was called and told over the phone by my employer that â€œwe have to to cut tiesâ€ because of some comments, assuming bad jokes out of recall, I wasn't aware they upset my co-workers. My first reaction led me to punch my fist into a wall in a public area and now my mind is swirling with thoughts of candid anger. This was my first firing and I'm not processing it well. My first thought is why bother apply for other jobs when I have the reason on my conscience? Second, if I do try again, then I better embrace the bias hateful questioning about my termination. Third if I tell anyone, then I will lose everyone close to me. Fourth, if I tell my parents, I will be a shame and burden to have committed such an act. Finally, looking back, I'm tempted to end my life rather than deal with future repercussions about my termination. If you've been fired for first time, how did you process it?",2
I've been depressed and I seem to be getting increasingly depressed each day. I want to die so this can stop but I don't want to die because I know that it hurts and would cause my family pain (specifically my sister because I was the one who was able to talk her out mid-attempt and my father because when he was around my age he lost a close cousin to suicide). I want to know if there's any other ways of solving this because I'm aware of how final suicide is but I know if I try talking to someone about this in real life I will just say things to be considered fine so I don't have to cost my parents money for therapy. I've recently started keeping a journal of my thoughts which has helped a little but I have no clue what else I would be able to do.,4

But my case is closed to say the least, I'm 23 Y/ M I didn't finish college, I have no career, I'm unemployable and flat broke, I have zero friends, never been in a relationship and still holding on the V card, basically I'm one of those people who has no life, your average loser worthless piece of crap, consuming food and resources just to stay alive.

"I'm in a pretty bad place right now, and suicidal again after months of feeling ""better"".
Yesterday was one of my lowest this year. I was going to take pills and alcohol, as much as I could handle. The bottle was in my hands, when I heard my dog about to vomit.
I got up to clean it and she was stumbling around, and then passed out. I got so desperate, took her on my arms and walked 15min to the closest clinic.
I didn't even remember my plans till I got home with her at night.

She had a bunch of exams made, and is on meds and relatively better. I keep thinking that if I had took the pills I would've been at least incredibly high, and wouldn't be able to help her.

"Fuck you brain fuck you. 

I've tried my whole life to be healthy. I succeeded for a little while. I was a healthsy weight and ate healthy (didn't really exercise) for about 3 years. Then I went crashing back down to how I used to be. I'm currently almost 220 pounds at 5 foot 10. Chronic heavy drinker, binge eater, lack of exercise.

"What kind of feedback (or perhaps lack of) are best when someone is self deprecating? To disagree, to give alternatives, to change subjects?
I don't hope to invalidate a feeling or pretend like it isn't significant or impactful.

I recognize this ought to vary with each person and each scenario, though I wonder about responses that have made things better, easier, made you feel understood, or responses that were absolutely unhelpful.

Many times, it feels proper to simply be there with/for the person when this is happening, but when it is time to say something it is challenging to gauge what is best to say.",5

"I have found that one of the main issues keeping me from being productive and moving forward is my inability to believe in myself. That is, I'm too worried about what others perceive me to be, and never being able to relax and exist in the moment. I've had therapy and medication for depression but none of it helps. If I can't be better or get better, what's the point? Why shouldn't I just kill myself? I don't want to keep trying. Life is boring. All my wildest dreams always lead to me ending up alone in some way or another. All so I can die without hurting anyone. I've been going over the attempts at suicide I've made in the past, and wonder if I just can't follow through on anything. All the self harm and pushing people away are just half measures to the real solution. I'm lost and alone, 5 dollars to whoever wants a free pass to kill me.",5
"Okay, let me tell you something. This is not out of the blue or anything. This is from my experience as well others.
When someone attempts suicide or seems to show suicidal traits, you are not supposed to hit them with aggressive sentences like ""Are you crazy? What the fuck is wrong with you?"" and insensitive sentences like ""Maybe, try this, it will help you die easily"" or ""Suicide is for the cowards"".
For a moment, take a step back and stand in their shoes. Try to understand, why they took such a big step. Ask questions like ""Are you feeling fine?"" ""Are you okay?"" ""Do you wanna talk about it?"" and ""I'm always here"".
That's the sign of an emotionally mature person who knows what to say when.
Do not also try to justify their actions by comparing your pain to theirs. Their journey, their struggles, their hurt are absolutely different from yours. Their tolerance level is different. You're not doing any good by constantly showering comparisons in disguise of advices.
Be considerate, be kind and approach such people gently. So many of you have to learn this that it deeply saddens me.",0
"I'm 24 and still have terrible acne. I used to not hate the way i looked up until high school, but then I got hit with the acne. Huge cystic acne that left scars all over my face and is super painful. I used to look at myself in high school the mirror and say "" I hate myself and want to die"" as a mantra. I was holding onto the hope that it was just a teenage phase, and that I would get on with my life after. Now its been years and years and I still get new zits and cysts every day. It's painful, and they pop and bleed everywhere. I've tried all of the acne treatments except accutaine which my doctor recommended against for reasons in my medical history. To offset the acne I grew my hair long and made it my main feature to distract from the disgusting acne. It became such a large part of my personality that all my friends at the time called me goldilocks. 

Then recently ago I started balding really quickly. My hairline is going way back, and I'm starting to lose hair on my crown. Looking at old pictures of my dad it's all gonna be gone in a few years. I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror. My face is red and pocked and covered in acne and the one and only thing that I liked about my appearance is slowly falling away. I'm some sort of freakish middle age man/ greasy teen hybrid. I used to have moderate luck is the relationship department back when I had my hair, but noone will even look at me now. My hair was the only thing I was ever complimented on. Now I'm treated like some monster that noone wants in their pictures or their life. 

I've been trying to not off myself for a while now. My family would be devastated and that's the only thing that is keeping me from doing it. My brother is getting his firearms licence and wanted me to come with him, but I had to refuse, because I know if I had a weapon it would just be a matter of time. What can be done to make the pain stop. To stop caring about how awful I look and how much I hate myself because of it.",3

"I go to a small school, normally no more than 20 students are in a classroom, yet my teachers don't even realize I'm in their class most of the time. I have amazing teachers, and they always want to help students learn, but I'm always forgotten about. I'm not slow enough to need special help, I'm not smart enough to need no help though. I'm pretty quiet, and I almost always get interrupted by loud people. If I actually work up the nerve to ask a question in my asshole-filled classes, the teacher gets distracted by two idiots trying to kill each other and forgets about me. 

I know I probably sound like a spoiled child that just wants attention, but I don't. All I want is to not be forgotten, to not be interrupted, to not be counted absent in a class when I'm always there.",2
"My close friend told me, get help. Get help. Get help. And how I could be bringing others down by even venting, so I stopped.

Because I refuse to take medication or be â€œcommittedâ€ and the only other person who understands is my friend, who is also suicidal. 

People who don't suffer from depression, extreme loss in life, or daily struggles don't understand that we don't exactly want to die, but these feelings have to.

It used to be something I did once every couple weeks at a party when I was a teen. Now it makes me happy. I love waking up still hungover with brain fog. It gives me this fuzzy feeling I used to feel with my SO. I know it's terrible for me. I still work out but that only gives me an hour high. I've realized if I'm sober my thoughts consume me and when I'm drunk everything's ok. My family and friends wonder how I do it but I guess I like the depressing hungover feeling.,3
"Over the course of my life, I have attempted suicide four times. Each time, I was hospitalized, and each time I've tried again. The last times, it failed because someone found and stopped me. My ex boyfriend commit suicide last year. I have difficulty making plans due to a mild obsessive compulsive disorder, and just finding time. 
I have a heart condition that has been steadily worsening after a miscarriage, and due to it, I can't hold down a regular job and have since resorted to online work that pays like shit. I'm homeless. I have only two people in any sort of position to provide support, emotionally. And even though it's looking like the most difficult parts of life are ending and getting better for me, I don't honestly believe a life with all these new restrictions is worth it. 
My family is going on vacation soon. I wasn't invited. That week, I can complete the steps the way I planned, if I want to. Now the question is if I even have the physical strength for one last shot at it. 
Who knows? 
It might fail again. But I have no doubt I'll keep trying. It's the only thing I haven't given up on.
Meditation and such seems to point me in this direction. Tarot readings, horoscopes, all of it seems to be dropping hints that this is it. The main difference between all the times before, is that this time, I have nothing left to be afraid of.

"So i was at a party and got drunk, not i cant walk drunk, but drunk enough to make my metabolism fast enough to get rid of all the meds in my blood i guess. I just finished high school and at this party were all my classmates and the people i once called friends. 
I thought i could go there and talk to them and try to befriend them again. I miss them so much. Ive always been very shy and i thought i would drink because that makes me all bubbly and stuff, but this time it just did not work, i went right past the bubbly and the very drunk and a mess straight to i feel like i wanna die.

So there i was, kinda off my meds and feeling depressed and there was a pool so in a place no one would notice too fast i started getting in slowly. Then i just jumped. I tried to do it but my body wouldnt all i wanted to do was sink to the bottom and numb everything out and then justgo i guess? But my body wouldnt, i couldnt physically do it.
My parents came and 4 people tried to help. Only one of which i would have expected and its not like i didnt like them i just didnt think they liked me, definatly not enough to help and im sure they will dissapear now, except for the one, but he cant take care of me like i need it. I need someone to be there all the time and i guess thats not fair.
I guess thats not fair, because thats how i lost my friends. They didnt understand i needed someone to be there and i tried to open up but i also need checkups, because i will convince myself im just bothering. 
I wanted one of my friends to help me the most, the one id known the longest, the one i had always been able to come back to, but i didnt get that she just didnt have the time or the will to help me like i needed anymore.
Now i dont wanna take the meds because i truly thought i was better. Turns out i was just drugged all the time and it feels so fake now. I thought i was happy and out of it and that soon enough my doctor would take me off them slowly. That i was starting to understand how not to be depressed, but now i think the only way to do that is to feel it and fight it, not take drugs and make it ""disappear"".

"Feeling this way isn't a bad thing. Something that is said to much in our society is that feeling suicidal if a bad thing. The whole ""don't do it,"" line is just a rewording of our society sentiment towards suicide. You should just know that feeling suicidal, even to the point of writing notes and making plans isn't a bad thing. There is no shame in falling when you've been beaten. Feeling suicidal is a perfectly natural response to bias, depression, psychosis, or any other horrible thing; you can't go near a fire without getting hot. There is nothing wrong with you for feeling suicidal, for feeling like you hate yourself. Maybe the reason you hate yourself is because you've never been loved, so you see no proof that you are worthy of any. Maybe it's because you have been biasdv so thoroughly you've been programmed to hate yourself. No matter the cause, I cannot stress this enough, it is not a bad thing. The bad thing is whatever caused you to feel this way",1
I have struggled with depression since I was \~13. I (with encouragement from my wife) finally want to see someone about it. Should I go to my general doctor first and get a referral or just try to find a therapist? I am in the US and my insurance does not require a referral.,0
"When I was 15-16 years old, I posted here in my darkest moments. I couldn't see any reason to keep living. I thought I was nothing special and the next 8 years seemed like an endless slog. You can look through my post history if you want. 

Since then, I graduated college and graduate school. I have traveled the world. I swam with bioluminescent algae in Indonesia. I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn't kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become.

Before you think about killing yourself, remember that you don't know how beautiful your life could become. How could you? You have no way of knowing until you get there. But you need to be alive.",1
"Sometimes life can be too much. We can often feel like sharing how depressed we are is being burdensome to those we love but all of the people who care about you, would much rather hear about how unwell you've been feeling instead of seeing you crack or break down or have to go to your funeral. It may not be comfortable but we have to be bold in our sharing with our friends because at the end of the day our people are all we have. Please, if you need to talk, dont keep it in. Find someone to talk to.",5
"Had a birthday, I am 22 now. I still live with my parents. Got kicked out of my state university and am at community college now for the second year. Take maybe 1-2 classes a semester (anymore and I'll be overwhelmed). Work about 10 hours per week at a data entry job my parents work at. Still come home and put off doing any homework or studying so I can play video games. Skip class a lot. Watch the same few shows over and over. Don't have a concrete idea for my future or what I'm going to do with it. 

Still laugh at humor I found funny when I was in my teens. Lie to all my old friends (haven't made a single new one in college, all friends are from high school or before) about how my life is going. Don't exercise often (genetics allow me to still be skinny, expect for my face which accumulates fat beneath my chin. Not a good look.) Self conscious about how skinny I am and never wear short sleeves in the summer. Social anxiety about my appearance.

What is wrong with me?? Why can't I move on from certain parts of my life and grow up and be more responsible and mature? What could this possibly be??",2
"Idk guys my life sucks. I mean i have more than the most people have, but it seems like my life just gives me shit. I try to be positive about the most things but it doesnt help at all. I even did lsd for like 4 times now. And every time i used like 3 hours just for thinking about my life and the things that make me happy. It helped me. I know what i want in life. I dont care about cars and money. I just want a Family with a wife that loves me. But with that Knowledge comes the fear that i wont archive those things. Idk i feel so alone at the moment. So fucking alone that i made a reddit post just to express my feelings. 
Idk i guess im gonna smoke weed and drink myself to sleep tonight. I hope you guys are fine. And remember mom would be sad..",4
"So I think about death all the time and regularly think about situations where I get hit by like a bus or have terminal cancer, it's so bizarre. Because I'm not actually a risk to myself, I'm not in any way planning any attempt but as I fall asleep it seems like I'm always thinking about how an exit wound would look at the back of my head. 


I call passive suicidality 'living in the Grey'. It's an inbetween state, smack bang in the middle of loving life and hating it. It's so strange because health professionals are always asking if I'm having 'dark thoughts' and it's like, well, what really *is* a dark thought? When it comes down to it, it's the behaviour, the intention, not the thoughts, that are the true issue. 

Death is always on my mind. Not just my own, but anyone and everyone. I think constantly about different situations where people in my life die tragically, and how I would grieve. Would I crumple into a depressed mess or rise to the occasion and be strong for the rest of my family? Who would care if I died? So many questions all the time. 


Anyone else constantly have death on the brain?",3
"So I've been scrolling down this page for a while now and I'm amazed by how much people feel the same way as I have for a while now. It doesn't make me feel any better but actually more determined to take my life knowing people live the rest of their life like this. 

I'm 16 years old I left school at 15 quit college at 16 and have no qualifications to rely on. I'm extremely socially awkward and possibly have deppresion I don't know. See the thing is I also have a extreme fear of doctors and just having people examine me in general and this has been taking more of an effect on me than normal.

Around December last year I took acid for the first time. I don't remember a lot about that night as I entered an incredibly deep bad trip after my friend was kicked out of the house leaving me alone on my first time. As I said I can't remember a lot about that night but 2 main factors stuck with me 1. My balls felt HEAVY real heavy 2. I thought I killed myself on multiple occasions that night. I kept seeing images of a weapon infront of me each time different each time more deadly. Everyone time believing they were real I tried to use them to end my life. And it felt like I would wake up everytime alive and I would cry. 

Reading back on this probably should have mentioned before I was already suicidal as shit before taking oh well.

Anyway couple months progress I'm doing ok and I'm lying in bed smoking a joint when that sane feeling of heaviness occurred in my balls not as strong this time but still there. After a couple weeks of consistent around night time feelings of heaviness occurred I decided to Google (yeah ik) my issue.

To my absolute fucking horror I discovered I have something called a vardicole or something like that I don't want to go back and check as I'm extremely 0aranoid of reading something I don't want to.

Now before anything gets typed I want to say that it is 100 percent that condition (whatever the name may be) as the symptoms aren't exactly common among other conditions. 

As I said in extremely scared of hospitals and getting examined so something around that area has an extreme effect on me even thinking about getting it checked.

I've been doing good for a while now but I can't get the thoughts out of my head and I can feel myself spiralling until those final moments where I can find eternal peace. 

So this is what I ask of you reading this if you would help me. I'm terrified of searching what will happen to me if I don't get surgery but I also kind of want to know so I'm basing this heavily on trust if you were to do a tiny bit of research on the condition and only leave a positive comment ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT CONDITION PLEASE. Like if it will damage me do not tell me even if it can kill please don't tell me. But if you find anything that will be reassuring please let me know. Because I'm not getting surgery so please please don't tell me anything bad about it I am genuinely terrified to post this in case people just say shit anyway 

Also to find condition type into Google wierd feeling in testicle or something like that I'm not sure I'm sorry I know it's is a lot but if you could take time out of your night to help me it would mean more than you know.",3
"I posted it here and people didn't believe me back then, I cared about it before but I don't care anymore.

I'm serving in the military and I feel shit about it.
I feel broken inside, I changed in a very bad way.

I started having brake-downs and even wetting the bed.

I feel embarrassed, ashamed, and the worse part is that I still have 2 years left (I served 1 year so far).

I haven't told anyone about wetting the bed as I'm not 4 years old. And frankly speaking I just don't want to think about it.

I'm thinking about just ending it sometimes... But I don't want to cause my family and friends any unnecessary sorrow.

I hate it. I hate myself. I hate my life.

If you read so far, thank you.",1
"I've been struggling with depression, S H since before my teen years and just started to barely get hold of myself. 

Like just today morning my brain was like, â€œLIFE IS MEANINGLESS! I WANT TO DIE! LET'S DO IT AGAIN! WRIST THEN FOREARM BECAUSE WE'RE DOOMED!!!!!â€

And I was like, â€œBAD BRAIN!!!!!â€ 

Then I realise: Even if the situations triggering you are no longer present, even if everything is running smooth by others standards, your brain still relies on its default thought pattern. The only thing one could do is to bypass these thought patterns until it becomes the default. 

Therapy finally made sense.",5
"Hello I am certain that I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for a number of years. As a result I completely withdrawn myself from society but the end of last year it was time for me to get a job, try and put myself back out there and hopefully make myself live bit more comfortably, and maybe give myself a chance of recovering life in my late 20s. I also believe I have dypraxia as I have difficulty talking to people in certain situations but I have complete fluency in others.

However, having got this job I'm experiencing a number of things of which I have experienced in every role since I have been working and that is people are quick to jump to conclusions, and this isn't me being paranoid. This is an accumulation of experiences that are similar for me and I know what will happen in a few months I'll be the most hated person at that job and everyday I go, they will most likely give me hell.

Can I say I have a mental health condition to my employer if I haven't been diagnosed? I don't really want them to personally attack me every time I enter a new workplace because I would like a chance of living too. Why are people so quick to assess one another then give them hell because one person front talk properly? 

I really needed a job which is why I never said anything about a mental health condition as I believe this would have almost certainly affected my chances. 

What should I do? Because if I don't do anything then I know what will happen during this adventure of employment, I will have to leave because of comments and accusations that aren't true. Something doesn't seem right there. Also, I know there is something wrong because hardly want to talk to anyone nowadays. I have no friends out of choice as an example. I dreamt of working very insular jobs growing up. Well may as well kill myself because no one can help they can give me placebos but they won't give me the one thing which will cure depression and other mental illnesses in an instant but they can't give me the job I wanted to do with my life so tell me what is the point? Thank you for reading and your time because it really wasn't worth it",3
"I've changed so much since I've gotten depression, I stop caring about school my relationships with my friend, I stopped caring what peaple think about me (witch can cause me to an asshole) before depression I thought I wouldn't even touch alcohol and now I'm starving to do shrooms (don't drink that much) I used to get decent grade and try now I'm just passing bc my teacher are rounding up my makes to 50, I've recently stopped cutting but only bc I have nothing to do it with and my gf doesn't want me to. I just wanted to get this off my chest",3
"I'm a 53 year old man and my life has sucked on so many levels. I've been married and divorced 3 times and several LTRs over the years, including the one I'm in now (over a year and we live together). I've got 5 kids, one just turned 13 last week. She wants nothing to do with me, nor does 2 of her half-sisters, who aren't even nearby (I called DFCS after we split because there were (literally hundreds) of roaches in the apartment in which we lived and she would so nothing about, among other things (like the time her autistic son found her loaded, insecure handgun), but those details are just stuff since I'm now a pariah. 100% would call again. So anyway, no contact with the youngest 3.

But what I'm really struggling with is, ""Why not?""

I know all of the typical reasons involving everyone else, that they'll be hurt, it will affect them horribly, etc. But what about me? Why not? My girlfriend really doesn't like me tbh. (she said I'm the rudest person she's ever met and I believe she means it, even though I've never been told that I was a rude person in 50 years.

But for me, aside from how it affects others, why the hell not? I have no religious faith, because I just don't. If you take away how it affects others, I just don't see a reason to keep living anymore. My job sucks, my girlfriend doesn't even really like me apparently, and I see my parents once a year for 2 days or so and my only brother I haven't seen in 7 tmyears even though we get along.

My hearing sucks, I'm constantly having to ask people to repeat themselves and that frustrates all involved. And even when I don't, I have really loud tinnitus. Neuropathy, ADHD, constant joint pain (not debilitating but always there), frequent memory loss (my gf had to show me pictures of our 3rd date at a steak place because I didn't remember it all and that's not uncommon).

So, why? My current relationship is probably ending soon anyway. For me, what's the point? I don't want to hear about how it affects others because that just adds more guilt to what's already been a pretty shitty life and kinda makes me want to stop that guilt too because I wouldn't have to feel it. I know it's selfish and suicide is indeed probably the most selfish thing I can do. I get that.

But why oh why should *I* want to keep on living when my whole adult life has been a cycle of misery and promises to be more of the same.

I know I shouldn't, right? In my head. But my heart just wants it all to be just over.

Help?",4
I assume that death by virus or something else would be less than suicidal.,3

"Goodbye

I wish things could have gone differently, I hate every second of life. I hate every thought that I have, every breathe that I take and every piece of my life. I don't want to suffer for the rest of my life, but I also don't want others to suffer for my â€œselfishâ€ choice. I hated growing up, biasd, everyday insults 

for something that I didnt do. I hated going home and then going back to school feeling different and separated from everyone else. I rushed life, I didnt do anything important growing up, I had amazing friends that I love and who also are the reason that I'm still here. I was always told that I didnt know 

anything, and maybe I don't, maybe this is a foolish choice, maybe theres a hell. I feel like my life is just going into a dead end. I hate college I dont even know what I want to do with my life, I feel like im wasting my time, but at the same time I feel like Im learning more about my self but why the fuck is it 

so hard? I have a chance to go the campus therapist, but for some reason i keep hesitating to call, its like I need someone to push me, but theres not going to be anyone, its just me alone in my dorm room. I just dont want to live anymore. I feel like Im worthless, I have zero value, I need someone. I feel almost like i'm only living for others..",1

"I feel like people don't understand the fact that being suicidal is not all about ""wanting to die"". I don't want to die, I just want the pain I'm causing to myself and those around me by being a burden to end and dying seems like the most relevant solution as most of the other stuff I have tried has failed. I think that's why I oversleep a lot, that way I'm not really living, its like temporary death, death without commitment. I don't even know what I'm talking about I guess I just want the pain to end.",5
"I don't know what I want to do in the future because I just don't want to experience anything of it. It has always been like that.

I don't have any plans because I don't want to be a part of this cruel machine any longer. 

Do you have difficulties making future plans because you don't really see a future for yourself? Can you relate in some way? What is your reason?",5
"Well, I've been thinking about posting on here and you know what? Today I'm just going to do it. I've been feeling abnormally sad for almost five years now. I've never gone to get clinically diagnosed with depression so I won't say I have it-but after having some dark thoughts these past three years...I won't deny it if that ends up being the case.
I have always had a small group of friends, and that circle is down to three. Out of those three friends, I have had one since 1st grade. After a mess up on my part (that happened almost three years ago), we haven't been as close as we once were. We don't share emotional things anymore. But we do laugh and joke a lot. That's mainly what our friendship is now. We only talk when we see one another, and if we contact each other over text-she usually finds a way to cut the conversation short. I know I'm loosing her. It hurts but I know she will find someone better than me to be by her side....
I have a second friend, she's been my friend since 6th grade. I don't feel like I'm loosing her as much as the others-but life issues are getting in the way of me seeing her so we haven't been able to talk much-if at all...
And my last-perhaps my closest friend now, just admitted today that he doesn't believe in the whole â€˜friendship' ordeal. He said that he believes none of his friends actually like him-and he said that right to my face today. He's detached from people, and when he thinks people don't care about him...he doesn't care about them. On top of that he's been really distant lately, and we don't have the deep conversations like we did in the past. When we talk it's about nothing in particular and it hurts the most seeing him go because he's always been there for me during my super low times. In response to what he said, I promised him that I would never stop trying to show him that I cared for him, but he brushed me off and said have fun trying.
I feel like I'm loosing my friends slowly. I don't talk to anyone anymore. I feel alone. I hate going out into public because that reminds me of how people have friends...when mine are slowly fading. I don't know what to do anymore. They are the reason I've been pushing through-and the reason I have pushed through in these past five years. I don't know what to do.
I can't talk to them because they aren't very emotional, and the one that is (the one that I haven't been able to see due to life issues) doesn't deserve this type of weight on her shoulders. I guess this is just more of a vent to get this off my shoulders. I could go on and on about so many different things but...this is the one that has been killing me as of lately. 
Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to read this. And...I know I sound hypocritical but...please never give in. Please. You matter.",1
"Everything i did to get out of depression and being suicidal backfired.... here's everything i tried.

1: i have tried being useful,i got a job, as a car mechanic, just to help people, but i somehow broke my arm... i quit that job... and didn't get accepted to any other jobs

2: i tried to find love, it was not really succesful.... i do get contacted by people, but its never to hear how im doing, or anything alse, i always get contacted by people when they need help, making me feel used... that stopped though, all becouse of: 

3:i tried making myself happy by making others happy,and it worked! For two weeks. becouse surprise! I got used again, i talked to people that i tought of as my friends, but it all backfired, fell in on itsef, and made me look like an asshoe who tries to make everyone fight.

"It just feels like life is a stack of endless bias and trauma from being born. I would prefer not to spend my life friendless, alone, and bullied or biasd for what seems like just being alive. And I'm sick of explaining what's going on. No one is helpful and ppl think their lives and perspectives and view points are the only ones that seem to exists. Life is truly miserable I can't even get out of bed anymore. I use to want to fight to be a musician. For what? To continue being biasd and mistreated? Fucking hell where does this shit end.


I guess the real question is how do people find ways to live for something they don't mind being biasd for. Something that is more gratifying than actually suffering. For me it is making music and sharing it. That's all. If I don't blossom as an artists I can't see any other way to make the pain worth fighting on for. I really need to focus on my music even if It kills me trying to reach my goals. What else is there for me to be alive for. I hate being biasd and hate most things in life. Having a mediocre job isn't worth being mistreated for. I have to die trying to do something from my wildest dreams or I will pull my plug. I'm just talking about myself. If you find joy in something I don't then that is great. Whatever keeps ppl alive. (Talking to myself trying to convince the shadow in my mind to not give in)",1

I AM A MAN FFS. To sum up the problem is that when I had given up on life everything seemed so ok and calm and now that I am putting effort into making my life better I cannot fucking control my emotions...

"Like the title says, I often times feel like I'm just a side character in the lives of those around me (19 M in college). It sucks. I was diagnosed with MDD about 2 months ago after struggling to convince myself I needed help for about 2 years, and it just kind of feels like despite trying to be more present in the lives of those around me I end up hurt and ignored no matter what I try. For example, I have tried to get into the habit of asking my roommates what they've been up to recently, how their day is going, if they want to get food, etc., and it just kinda feels like they don't have the time or motivation to reciprocate. When I try and share something from my life, I just feel like they shrug me off or ignore me completely. Every day feels like I am growing apart from those around me and needless to say it's not fun. I am introverted by nature, so socializing can often be exhausting, so I guess it's just even more insulting when those around me blow me off despite the colossal effort it can take to even say hello.",5

I decided to get help a few months ago when those thoughts came back and I'm glad I did. I won't bore you with all the details but work was the reason for a lot of my issues so i decided to be proactive and change it. Well today i just got an offer at a company that I've wanted to work at since I started college! And best of all it's back in the same town as all my friends who graduated with me. I know I will be happy there, more so than this place. And I'll be surrounded by people who made me enjoy my life for those short 4 years. I'm hoping this was the change that I was looking for. I made every excuse as to why nothing would get better and to just live it out. I start next month!

"I suffer from extreme lonliness and endure depression from it. 

I once tried to get professional photos done and the photographer was very rude and not understanding why it was so hard to just smile or look more optimistic.

"I've been diagnosed with depression by two different doctors, but they would do their consults so quickly I think they could be wrong.
I don't feel like hurting myself, I don't feel like killing myself (even though I think about how I would do it), I just can't do things.
Looking of how it is for other people I wonder if I haven't been misdiagnosed, and be just lazy.",3

"I went out casually with someone who died from suicide weeks after he found out I was seeing other people before I even called things off with him. Back then i didnt think it would be wrong because I thought i made it really clear that while I liked him, we weren't exclusive.

Sometimes the self blame and guilt get so immense and overwhelming and I want to go, too. Sometimes I'm terrified that if it was really my fault, it would come bite me in the ass one day. That thought intensifies the urges to tap out, because I think it would take the blame with me.

It also scares me whenever I remember that analogy about glasses being full, and what if this is how my glass spills over? How do I empty my glass?

Is it my fault? Will I ever feel like it wasn't? Is it okay to feel like it wasn't?",4

"Perhaps I'm just playing the victim, but life has been pretty shitty lately and I'm spinning circles in my head. Am I the problem? Are all of the situations I find myself in, woven by me? Am I the diabolical monster weaving this fucking hell I'm stuck in? I'm so fucking tired of my brain coming to the conclusion that I am the victim. I'm tired. Some how it's your fault that I'm codependent. It's your fault that my choice in men has always been the worst. I mean, it has to be your fault that I married at 19, to the only person stupid enough to say yes. It has to be your fault that I'm four years into a relationship I feel has no escape. I'm drowning and I have the weight of an entire second person tugging at my feet. I fucking blinked and here I am. Years older but my brain feels like it hasn't evolved in the slightest. Still easily disturbed and hurt. Still putting all my trust into one person just to be let down. Just to come to the harsh realization that they are human too, they make mistakes too. I know, I knowâ€¦ Everyone fucks up, but why does it feel like the world is ending when the people that mean the most to me fall short of my unrealistic expectations? Why do I feel ridiculously deceived? Surely I am their whole entire life, surely their world revolves around me. Why do I get stuck with these insecure, unsure thoughts rolling and crashing in my head. Surely it's your fault, of course. I mean you were supposed to be the only man that never left. You were supposed to be the one that held me when I was let down. You were supposed to show me that I deserve more than what my taste lusts for. I'm sorry you never had that either. I'm sorry no one ever showed you right from wrong and I'm sorry no one held you when your heart was broken. 

I just don't know what to do now. I keep trying to stay in a rational state of mind and stray away from the path that was paved for me. It just so hard when I keep playing the victim.",4

My best friends have given up on me, they tell me fuck off cause they don't want to be around me.

"I'm currently on Zoloft and Lamictal for anxiety. Few months ago I stated having panic attacks, but they resolved with zoloft. Yesterday something very freighting happened to me. As I was talking to my daughter's teacher I felt I was slowly disconnecting from the surroundings. I was forgetting where I was, who I was talking to. This horror lasted 2 hours. After I finally took Klonopin the symptoms stopped. I'm relatively a healthy person. I will be seeing a neurologist to make sure that there is no other underling condition.

I do nothing almost everyday, but have too much anxiety to do much else. I don't understand how people can get out of bed everyday and just do SOMETHING. I don't have motivation to really LIVE, but I continue existing for a reason I don't even know. All of my friends are depressed and feel generally lost too. But they have jobs and get shit done. And I just don't. I feel like a ship just dead at sea. I don't want to die, but just want to escape.",5
"I was bullied for most of my school life. It started to get better at around 11th grade. Before that I have never really experianced girls that were nice to me. But for as long as I can think I have been dreaming about the soft touch of a woman. Not sexually but just being hugged. Or snuggling. Now at the end of 10th grade I started self-improving like theres no tomorrow. And it went uphill for me real quick. I started to work out daily, started fighting sports, joined the volunteer firefighters, volunteer wildlandfirefighters and recently sent out my application for the german red cross. It all went well exept one thing. I still wanted a girl to like me. Now more than ever before after I finished firefighting training and had my first ""psychologically demanding"" firecalls. Sometimes I just come home and wish that a girl would just come out of nowhere and hug me. I am still a kissless virgin even though from the outside I may even be desireable. At least thats what some people tell me. But because most of my life there weren't really any girls that were nice to me, I interpret every single nice thing from a girl as some kind of flirt. Then I get feelings for almost every single girl there was. They could be as bitchy as anything but as long as they're a woman, I would develop feelings for her and make advances. Openly flirting with almost every girl I knew. I was sort of known as the needy guy. Some people told me and I slowly realised that I had no chance with girls if I act like this. Then one of my ""favorite crushes"" (there are a lot of them) had a long talk to me. I told her how I felt about my needyness and my past. She told me I dont have any chance with her (she told me before) but that if I stopped thinking about girls all the time then maybe someone would actually turn up. That was the first time I really talked to someone about my problem and it was devastating. I couldn't stop thinking about women. For years when I'm home alone I'd pretend that there was a girl in my bed. Asking how ""her"" day was, making out with the pillow and everything. Sometimes at dinner I would put two plates on the table and just talk with ""her"" about ""her"" day. I didn't know how to help myself and because of all my volunteering work and sports I don't have time for a therapist. So then I had the idea of punishing myself if I'd think about women. And with no other ideas I started doing that. Every day I'd take my leather belt, take off my top and start belting away at my back. I'd take my phone and turn on porn and start belting myself so I would stop getting an erection when something sexual happens. At school and volunteering work I'd pinch my trizeps real hard whenever I'd think about women or would look at a girls butt or breasts. Now everytime I see a girl I'd just catch a glimpse of her and quickly look away. In the beginning it helped. I stopped thinking about girls. But after some time I was on edge all the time. Hurting myself at the slightest thought of someone. I'd look at women at firecalls or when I otherwise needed to. But otherwise I'd look away. And now it just hurts. My confidence has plumeted. I'm looking at the ground the whole time. I have spots on my back and arms. I am feeling like shit all day. Tired and with no motivation for anything anymore. I just dont know what to do anymore.",4
"I'm only 14, but I've been through 3 abusive parents, my mother is slowly going insane because she won't accept that my sisters and I are growing up, so we have no freedoms whatsoever, I'm suffering from severe anxiety and depression, and I'm rapidly losing my vision, and the only reason I haven't killed myself is my friends from band, but I don't hang out with them because I feel like I'm a burden on everyone around me, I feel like people think I'm annoying, and I don't want to subject them to that, so I kind of avoid people when I can. Idk what to do.",4
"By nature of my mental health conditions, I'm someone who doesnt really have any aspirations in life and even if I did I wouldnt have the energy or stability to achieve it, as has proven to be the case in the past. I wouldnt say im depressed but more just apathetic and accepting of the thought that nothing will change, that this is as good as it gets. I've experienced all that I've wanted to experience so what more is there to do except wait to die? 

Im not interested in marriage, children or any type of career. I just spend all day sleeping, eating and watching TV which is getting boring after doing it for several years. It wouldnt be so bad if I could enjoy some of my solitary hobbies that I used to enjoy but now I just pick something up and then lose interest within a few minutes. It just feels like I'm delaying the inevitable at this point as I dont know how many more years I can put up with doing the same old crap until something other than myself kills me.

I feel guilty for thinking it but I just wish that my 2 family members that I'm close to would die just so that I can't feel guilty in my last moments about leaving them with grief. Then again, I know it'd be a relief for them in a way knowing that I wont be hopelessly trying to survive without them in this life. It's becoming easier to see the potential positives to me killing myself compared to the negatives. 

What's worse is that I'm transgender and have completed my transition (F&gt;M) but rather than it being a lease of life, its become more like a 'phew, at least now I can die in peace' type of situation. So theres a peaceful element involved now which makes it all the more tempting.

Im just progressively finding it harder to see a point in living and it doesn't seem like anything is able to change it at this point",1
"I wanted to kill myself a couple days ago. My family was supposed to leave the house for a few hours, which would give me time to do it. They didn't leave and I'm so angry. It's not fair on them. They couldn't know. But I'm still so angry. I'm not supposed to be alive right now and yet, here I am. And it's all because they decided not to go. If I had chosen not to, been moments away and stopped because I'm a coward, that would have been fine. But no. I don't even get to blame myself for it. I just wanted it to be over but now I have to keep going for longer. I hate myself for hating them over this.",4
"I feel like my life is spiraling out of control and I have no idea why and I hate it so much. Nothing ever seems to go right for me and I'm stuck in this stupid rut and I'm so fucking tired of it. My life is one long loop and I feel like there's no purpose to any of it and I honestly just want it to be over because I have no idea what to do. I don't have the energy to do anything I love anymore and nothing makes me happy because even if it's going well I know that it's just on the surface and deep down I still wish I was dead. I worthless, like I just take up space and I don't deserve to get help. My little sister started going to therapy last year after my parents found out she was harming herself but I can't even count the amount of times I've sat on the floor sobbing to my mom about how I can't take being alive anymore and no one has done anything to try to help me. I'm begging for someone to help because I feel like no one cares. 

The worst part is being tired. I'm so fucking sick of being exhausted no matter what I do. I'm always in a fog no matter how much sleep I get and I can't focus or think. My head always hurts. I feel like my body is shutting down. I don't have an appetite and I lost about 20 lbs since the summer. I gained some back and started hating the way I look so that's going for me too now. Now I don't eat because 1. it makes me feel sick 2. I hate the way I look 3. I know it'll hurt me. I'm fucking sick of all of it. 

For my entire life, I'm supposed to have been perfect. I can't admit any of this to anyone because I'm so scared of being pitied or being vulnerable. My grades are slipping and I don't know how to deal with it because my entire life is being a perfect student who's going to get into a perfect college and if I can't do that I'm fucking worthless and I should just be dead. On top of all that I think I might be a lesbian, and that is one of the things I hate most about myself, more than my body or personality or grades or anything else. 

I think about killing myself every single day but I'm too scared to do it. I have a plan and I have a suicide note written down just in case so it's ready if I decide to ever do it. I don't even want to die. I just want all of this garbage to be over. I'm 17 and I feel like I'm not going to make it another year if things keep going the way they are and I'm honestly scared. I just wish I was never born so that I wouldn't even have to go through killing myself and that way no one would be hurt if I was dead. If I die I don't have to apply to college or come out or worry about failing any more or eat or hate the way I look or hurt myself or anything because it would all just be over and I wouldn't have to deal with any of this shit. I'm so fucking tired of all of it. I can't even think of a legit reason why I feel this way and that's what I hate most of all. Everything is going wrong and there's no tangible reason why and that makes me want to panic. I'm so frustrated and I have no outlet for any of it and I don't even feel like a human any more. My whole life is barely keeping my head above water in school, coming home and chugging green tea so I don't eat, and wanting to kill myself when something small goes wrong. I just want it to be over. 

tldr I wish I was dead and I don't know why",5
"This feeling comes and goes and I usually keep it suppressed by submerging myself in mundane stuff. I am 34 years old and I have been dealing with these episodes of worthlessness since probably middle school. I grew up in a small rural town in Puerto Rico. I can't say we all know each other, but everyone knows everyone else's business. 

I grew up in a strict pentecostal family with many rules forced into my siblings and I. We used to go to church usually 7 days a week and on Sundays twice (Bible school in the morning and afternoon/evening service). Secular music was prohibited and any tv material that was deemed â€œdemonicâ€ by the pastor. 

Of course, living in a pentecostal family made a huge impact on who I was from elementary school all the way until I decided to part ways with the faith later on in my 20s. I was so insecure about myself and tried super hard to fit in with the other kids. It was a challenge because I never felt understood by the others, mainly because I had nothing to relate with them. I was not allowed to listen to secular music or even go to the movies because of rules my mom enforced on all of us. 

That insecurity grew even stronger when entered high school, which of course was the worse years of my teenage years. There were so many things happening in my life at that moment that I thought in some weird way it was all normal. 

During the last years of elementary school my dad decided to distance himself from church. He became an alcoholic shortly after and everything went downhill from there. He multiple affairs that my mom was ware of and that didn't turned out well for me. My mom became aggressive and depressed. I used to get hit for no reason that I can remember to this day.

I think she felt trapped because divorcing my father was not an option due to her fanaticism. My mom used to break stuff every day, scream and yell, stayed inside her room all day and praying for the most part. One positive thing I can say about her is that we were never hungry and somehow she always found ways to provide us with clothes and food. 

My dad disappeared for many months one time and I thought he gave up on us but specially on me. I felt so betrayed by him. My mom was also non-present in my life or school. My grades dropped drastically and I was bullied a lot at school for being alone the majority of the time. 

There is so much to say about everything that happened but, I thought I was over that and everything that happened. Today I am angry at my parents because how irresponsible they were with their kids. I compare myself to every one else around me and I feel like I should've had a better upbringing. I know it's up to me know and they are no longer responsible but it still hurts me so much. 

I deal with my insecurities every day and that is something I'm never gonna be able to change. I compare myself a lot with everyone. I tend to feel like a way lesser version of whoever I am comparing myself to. I'm going to therapy and that helps to a degree. I just wish I could find people or at least someone that can relate to this.

"I desperately hope that life beyond this world is more exciting. Life on earth has always seemed hollow and artificial to me in some ways, like it's a shadow or diet version of the real thing.

"I'm writing this because I've just once again thought about killing myself but this isn't even within the first 100 times I have thought of suicide from a young age I'd say roughly around age 11-12 I first thought of just ending it I even remember how I sat at a window ledge looked down and just bathed in the moment before climbing back down with tears coming down my face because I wasn't strong enough to. 

Wowâ€¦ well I bet that sounded crazy I wasn't strong enough to kill myself a direct contradiction of what strength is but a las I and any other who has felt how I feel will relate. 

So about me, of course you must be wondering how did he get this fucked up what has happened. Well im going to let you all know just in case once day I do get my strength. I am one of 10 children slotting in at number 7, I have been emotionally and physically biasd by those who were supposed to nourish me. Here's whats different though so not only did they make my life hell they controlled my life where I was and what I was doing to the extent that I couldn't even make my own decisions on the little things and still cant. 

Thing's I have been beaten for just so you get the vibe

Â· As a child I would pee in my sleep so I would be woken up by a belt hitting my body

Â· As all kids do I would fall asleep on the sofa watching tv, so I would be woken up with a belt hitting my body

Â· I once told my dad there was no point in doing something AGAIN because nothing was good enough for himâ€¦ to which I was beaten with a metal pole until I could no longer use my arms to defend my self and just took blows to the head dripping blood all over the house.

**To summarise I have been fucked up.**

But im trying to figure out how and when this all started at what point did I become the person I am now (Afraid ,insecure ,manipulative and untrustworthy). I give myself these attributes because that's all I really am. I am afraid of the world horrified possibly I have ran out of classes (IN FUCKING UNI) because I felt as if everyone was looking on me I have this crippling feeling that everyone is always looking at me. Insecure lol I don't even know what to say I have deleted everything on my social media's multiple times purely because the anxiety of someone giving a fuck enough to look at them and then the possibility of them finding my pictures funny gives me so much anxiety that I'd prefer them not be there. Am I manipulative yes, but I don't understand how one can not be manipulative. I like to have things my way of course we all do but I know how to get it done I know how to get responses out of people or to get people to do what I want because I had to learn to. I'm one of fucking 10 children and I showed up in the middle and this wasn't no brady bunch happy family shit this was controlling, abusive and manipulative and I guess that's what I became, you are a product of your environment after all. I don't really know the purpose or direction of this as I have just stopped crying again (its 2:13pm) and decided fuck it imma do this so if I do kms at least maybe one mf'er can know what I been trying to say.

So guys I think im going crazy this is a new development if you don't mind me starting here, I sit in my room and talk to myself inside my head for hours a day full on conversations (guess this is what happens when you don't get to train social skills). Sometime's I cry sometimes I get so angry I don't even know what to do and sometimes admittedly I feel straight up heart broken as if I have been done a disservice by the world and unfairly I was born into one family instead of another. I fantasize too much and I kind of sorta relate to people from Netflix series. Like Joe the stalker I get it bro you just want to feel a solid love that aint going no where and youll do anything to keep that but in turn you require a few things loyalty being one of them. Fortunately I can say I don't relate to him with his killing (that would just be another burden in my head to drive me crazier) instead when my heart is broken people just kick the pieces to side and move on. 

Fuuuuuuck im really not good at structuring things I write.

Ok I think the logical thing to do is start with little stories from childhood and work my way to present day. 

I was born in 1998 in Africa and moved to the United Kingdom at a young age not sure how young because I don't remember. My dad had been previously married and had 5 children from his first wife and at this time only 3 from my mum me and my 2 brothers one a year older one a year younger. It's said that when I was born they thought I was a fucked up baby, I was going to be disabled or something of the sorts (not in a doctor said it way, but like I was born and they looked at me and said na this aint it way and little would you know my little brother was born just under 10 months later) Fantastic way to start life. So we all lived in one house when we first got to the UK (very vague memory of this shit by the way combination of what I've been told as fact and what I know to be true) So as a kid I have been described as a quiet and timid kid so quiet infact that my older brother and sister (age 12-14) (from a different mother) would pinch me or hit me to make me cry because when I would cry it was funny that I would make no noise. I was also a huge fan of lion king asking them to watch it multiple times a day with me, everyday. We then moved a couple times memory all blurry and we arrived at the next destination that I remember. We lived in a flat in a small town in England for a couple years, my memories of this place are my constantly injuring himself severly by playing out, dbz, Toonami, vegeta and ps2. I was a normal kid but I would get fucked up by my dad. (btw im around 4-6 years old) I still remember the time I was called downstairs just to be beaten I think for drawing a rude picture that was discovered after I had just been beaten. Boom boom not too much going on just the entrance to a life of suffering but not too much tbh. 


We then moved to a council house elsewhere just kids and mum because dad had decided its stressful to live with people so he'd rather pay 1k+ rent elsewhere for his own place then help his family. These years weren't too bad though if anything they were my favourite because he wasn't around it was just us 3 years in that place from year 2- year 5. He would still drive down though on occasion just to hit us and then return to his home on the flip side of the uk. This was fantastic for my personal growth of course as I learnt that being a father means coming over shouting and arguing with your wife, beating your children and then cutting. And by beating I mean sure we were between ages 7/8-10 but he would hit us with all he had leave belt marks for days all over my body. To the extent the neighbour's would hear us screaming and would then mock us the next day as we walked to school. He then thought that we were becoming bad children (at the time me and all my siblings were top in our classes thanks to our mum keeping us up to study with her , as well as this at this age we started being forced to go to mosque mon- fri (5-7) and then over the weekends we would go to Arabic school and if we were at home we would play outside in the park so I don't know how bad we could of really been but who knows.(she was in college so while she did her homework she helped us with ours)). Actually with that being said I would steal from my mum not a lot and not everyday but a pound or 2 here and there just because everyone else in school could afford to buy things like sweets and toys and I would never be able to join in because I had none. I would come home from school and mums not in so id have to sit outside the house for a couple hours people would walk by but I had no friends house to go to like my brothers so I would just sit at the door and wait. My life has been hell maybe its easy from an outside view to say naa aint that bad but try live it everyday you come home aint no body even in, by the time everyone does get in its all at once no time for you and mum to talk no dad asking how was school bruh go to sleep. To summarize though I was studying everyday 7 days a week and still being beaten along with my brothers but I had a newly born sister and it was time for the move to the big city so fuck it maybe its about to get better.Bruh I forgot and now remembered this nigga would look all 3 of us in the garage for whole days just because and the punishment for leaving would be you get beat and thrown back in there. Think about the mentally how much that would fuck you up you aint even fucking 10 yet.

When we first got to this new city we were quick to discover its rough out there day one we were robbed. They were no more parks we could just go to play at so now I became and indoors kid. To go along with that now my dad didn't live too far away he was only in the neighbouring town so instead of monthly â€œvisitsâ€ it was now weekly. Fair enough to say within a year I had put on I don't know 10 maybe 15kg I was fat af going into year 7 but in year 6 I was a very thin framed kid. I was depressed and I'm not sure if I knew it but my life consisted of go to school and be bullied to come home and be beaten not knowing where my safe place was I chose solitude I learnt out of sight out of mind (didn't even work all the time but nigga I tried) My mum became pregnant againâ€¦ (this was not necessary but I've grown to love the child) so now they are soon to be 5 kids and none of which already receive and adequate amount of love. Just to further paint the character of my father he beat my younger sister who was at the time maybe 3/4 because she took and hid his phone (later revealed he left it in his jacket pocket) NO APOLOGY HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN EVER IN HISTORY FOR A MISTAKEN BEATING. We spent little time in that house but what do ire member being dragged from under a bed to be beaten and being beaten nearly every morning without fail for 1/2 years for bed wetting (punches were not pulled). 


We moved again after same sort of thing really he'd show up for a few days fuck up everyones mood and cut no one wanted him around but no body would say because everyone was afraid of getting beat again. This is the house I lived in when I decided ahh man maybe this life thing isn't for me went and sat at the window ledge in my room 3rd floor looking down and wished I could just let go. We would be locked in the attic this time the door is genuinely locked we couldn't get out if we wanted room was what 3x4 meters storage room basically and 3 of us had been locked in there for the whole day. Living in such circumstances created bitch nigga behaviour amongst us as brothers because the beatings were bad you did not want to be beaten it would fuck your whole shit up. So niggas started snitching bruh my own brother came in my room while I was learning to beat my meat took my phone took pictures of what I was watching and then showed everyone while I was sat in the living roomâ€¦ I was then promptly beaten. This the environment I grew up in even in your own fucking room you couldn't do shit you couldn't trust nobody and you were very likely going to be fucked up for anything you did. This could include but was not limited to holding your brothers hand while fightingâ€¦ (that's gay apparently so you would be beaten). Defending yourself to your parents (Its rude to speak back so I was beaten), Not speaking (its rude to not speak when spoken to so I was beaten). Finishing the milk bruh imagine your 12 year old hungry self wanted some cereal finished it and then gone beaten for it that was my fucking life. Id go to school this fat unloved ugly kid, (I think this is a good time to point out I went to a bad school in a white neighbour hood and as we all know aint nothing scarier than poor white people jkâ€¦) but those guys were harsh to me day one of highschool I had a fight why because I was being racially biasd, I was constantly racially biasd I was not even accepted by my own race because I wasn't black enough (I am quarter white 3 quated black so skin color dark brown meant I was a paki, I was an Indian I was a terrorist osama bin laden was my uncle so on and so forth) aint no body ever gave a shit about me not a single teacher not no body. And this is where things get fucked up for me this when I started doing dumb shit I started being a prick to my friends not fully understanding what was even going on but just thinking out of I gotta cover my back I gotta make sure I aint no punk but in reality it made me into a punk. But ill get to that later. I still remember everything nice people have ever said to me that I felt was said genuinely though, once the most popular kid in school told me to not let anyone pick on me and just tell them im not Asian although I had tried both I felt his sincerity and very much appreciated it and still think about it to this day. 

I wanna fast forward now to year 11 when shit really hits the fan, I moved to a school which was mixed gender (years 7-10 I was in a boy school) and the introduction of women had definitely caught my eyes (hadn't seen them in many years since everyday was school mosque home runescape repeat maaaaaaaaaan FUCK THAT SHIT that's the worst childhood and to make it better slide a couple hundred beatings in over those 3 years and now you might be beginning to get a grasp on who I am as a person. Of course they are little moments when things workout but not really. To summarise I was in love or atleast I felt like I was I did horribly on my exams which at the time I accreted to me just focusing my time on her and not myself and that started the downwards spiral. My little brother told my parents I wasn't fasting at prom (I have not ever fasted a day since, pretty sure I gave up on religion a long time ago but that's its own thing) and I was beaten then locked in the house so I could not attend my final meeting for NCS (I had saved up my 5 a week for 10 weeks to pay the 50 to go and now I just couldn't imagine that feeling I was going to finally be away from this whole home all summer and now I couldn't why because my dad who had now moved in full time had decided to spite me). 


The summer of finishing high school of enjoyment had arrived my plans to be with my friends had been put to a halt. My plans of going to a top 3 college in the city had been put to a halt. My summer was instead me just sitting in my room everyday the whole summer alone not talking to anyone for multiple days at a time. This is when my solitude became serious I became an awkward nervous rek after this I couldn't even talk to people properly without overthinking everything id say if summer was 10 days long I was beaten on 6/7 days as well so yh torture house and to make it better I had no friends because we moved so fucking much I didn't know a single person and couldn't get to know them because we lived in a jewish neighbour hood and if you've ever lived in one as the only black muslim family you aint going to have no friend. But yh returned to college and it was ok except for everyday I would come home and be locked out of my house everyday without fail my dad would sit in the kitchen looking out the window and laugh at me having nowhere else to go so I would sit in the gardens storage cupboard nothing much at all probably just a big wardrobe but It was dry. I would then go to college and repeat this process day by day mentally exhausting my self little by little more once again through in beatings on.4 out of every 10 days and you have the image of what my first year of college was like. My parents decided as a family we should read the quran together (muslim people book not all of it like a page each a day) so I read my page and left and while I was goning upstairs I heard him talking about me so I decided ah im probably going to be beaten let me stay here and wait so I did and soon enough I heard him say â€œwhy did he read that page, he read that a few days ago hes looking for the easy onesâ€ so my mum said â€œill call him back down and he can read againâ€, I was called â€œâ€¦.. come downstairs and read againâ€ and I replied â€œWhats the point nothing I do is good enough for him anywayâ€ to which he responded by walking into the kitchen getting a metal pole and coming to hit me with it. The best bit for him it was a detached house so no one could even hear my screams. At first I tried to block with my left arm and then I just couldn't hold it up anymore so I switched to the right and the same happened so then I was just lying there being beaten by my dad with a metal pole bleeding all over the floor from my head and when he thought he was done he left. This day is the day I lost my shit as soon as I could stand I went and grabbed a knife but was stopped by my mother (I always found it funny how she would always come to stop me but never him). I then called the police when they arrived they was so much blood on the ground floor corridor that she threw shoes over to hide it because it could not be cleaned while he sat there on the sofa smug knowing he had gotten away with it my mum had hidden me from the police and that was that another great day in the life. 

I had become sick of it and told my mum I do not care what she thinks I am tired and I am leaving I will go to foster care if I must but I am not dealing with this shit anymore (I don't know if its important but I was also 17 without a phone or laptop or any communication with the outside world, if I was in my room all day I was playing badminton against the wall staring at the ceiling or creating fantasies in my mind to rescue me from where I was currently) I told her ill get a job (just received ni number) ill figure it out for myself and what did she do?

She said nothing for maybe a month and then we were moving house so she came in one morning and just told me we are moving pack up so I did thinking we are moving away from that cunt and she had chosen me her son over her manipulative controlling abusive husbandâ€¦ Instead she had rented another place and just dropped me off there would come round maybe every month or 2 for an hour or so and that was my life. Now I was completely secluded and this was the first time I actually tried to kill myself I had a panic attack the anxiety just got to me I took all my sleeping pills at once and boom I woke up the next dayâ€¦ they were all fucking natural herbal things and they couldn't do shit. Bummer I know. She still doesn't know about this I continued thinking about killing my self shit I never stopped from that first time till now but It was just thoughts and ideas I had finally tried to and failed. Instead I started smoking weed which would help sometimes but other times like I learnt the hardway it would make me think about my life and whats actually happened and compare it to my peers around me and I would breakdown crying. My life has no direction, I have no family around me (which is ironic in a family of 13(3 parents 10 kids))because we had all been tormented soo much we didn't know to look out for eachother we had to look out for our selves first. This is why im selfish I cant afford to not be because if im not my own number 1 In terms of in a greedy way like If I don't look out for ME first no one else will. My mum then told me she didn't want to continue paying for where I lived and I had to find somewhere else (now that I was 18/19) which is a real bitch because if I had just done what I wanted to years back and left this family of suffering I would have been alright but instead now im going to college everyday thinking about where tf am I going to live. So I dropped out of college to work, I ended up returning to college having to restart living in a city different to the one I studied in working night shifts to then go straight in to class but I figured it out. Got to uni and guess what I don't know what the fuck is going on. 

Everyone is social and I don't know how to socialise sometimes I feel as though I stand out so badly that im just not supposed to be there im surrounded by people who life has blessed people who have seen the world people whos parents love them soo much that they even come to watch them train at uni. In my whole fucking life there has never been a single thing I've done which I can say I looked into the crowd and had a single person there to support me. Instead I have been told to dream is free, I've been told your not going to make anything with your life and you are going to be a failure. Honestly I have accepted these as truths now. I don't even feel like myself anymore I feel stupid as if i took a couple too many hits to the head information doesn't sink in properly anymore. I'm embarraced in class because everyone else knows what they are doing to some level I have no fucking idea everyone else goes home for Christmas or there family comes to visit. LOOOL my family don't give a single fuck. I AM ALONE IN THIS WORLD TIRED DEPRESSED AND READY TO GO. I accepted death a little while back, one night I was lying in bed crying and realised I don't have to deal with this anymore I really don't I have accepted I will kill myself and I am just waiting for the day in which I get my final little nudge to step of the ledge.

I just want to be at peace.

I also had a girlfriend for a while she cheated on me so I stopped valuing her as a person and just kept her for the other stuff. She even got pregnant and aborted it. I'm 20.

&amp;#x200B;

Questionâ€¦ am I crazy for feeling like this? And if you were in my shoes do you think you would feel the same or different.",1
"Hi there to all witches who take their craft seriously and really work, I am very deperate and on the brink of killing myself, there is so much to life; this I know. Unfortunately for me every door, every option, every opertunity has been closed off for me since I was born. 
Before I say what I came here to ask here's alittle backstory...

Backstory - throughout my mom's pregnancy the doctors were absolutely sure I was to be born a healthy baby girl, but somewhere along the line something unexpected happened and I came out not only a boy (according to what I've been told and what's written on my birth certificate) I was also unfortunate enough to be born with cleft lip, cleft palette, asthma, droopy eyes(don't know if that's the clinical term, but basically up until I was 8 or 10 [can't remember] I was unable to open my eyes all the way), and various other problems. I have always felt like I should not have been born a boy let alone live past 3 weeks (another failed diagnosis, lucky me right?). 

My childhood consisted of doing stuff to get attention but really all I wanted was to be liked a very hard thing to do when you are basically physically retarded and cannot talk like everyone else and constantly being reminded how you are such a failer that you couldn't even be born right. Since my conciousness first made its way into this world I have found myself thinking as a girl, along with thinking how much better litterally my life would have been if I managed to get it right. My dad was never in the picture so growing up without a father has been difficult on its own, but of course I was informed my dad had the chance to come to America when I was born because of my condition, but he declined to start a new family and I'm sure he had other reasons. My mom always worked all the time so it was pretty much me and my older brother for some time. An older brother that constantly made fun of me along with my mom for how I talked and how I acted. My brother constantly calling me gay, faggot, bitch, you name it he's done it. I'm sure he was unaware of how I felt inside but it traumatized me so much I am afraid of being myself. My body is not shaped how normal guy's are either so I have no idea how to take that problem. At school o was labeled the retarded kid no one liked.

Once I turned 11 my mom met a man, let's call him D. D was/is military and I later found out they got married quick (span of a few months) to finance my surgeries because I came from a background of poverty being single parent with 2 kids (later 3). I was always treated like a pet and always had the harshest and most frequent punishments. I was always forced to do everything for everybody else. My brother had to go do something like talk to a neighbor to get the bike fixed, I had to do it, stuff like that. To this day I get asked by family to buy their plane tickets or order them stuff cause they ""don't know how"". I have always been used all my life. I am nothing but a tool. As I patiently waited for the surgeries that I was supposed to get (atleast just the one to fix my nose and make me look somewhat normal) when I was 12, then delayed to 16, then 18, and finally at 19. I received the first surgery and all they did was make my life a living hell. 

Medical history - The doctor messed up my nose and now theres a glasses size gap on the bridge of my nose, for the tip of it they put cartalage from my side [which they lied to me and took it out of under my right chest] is fat which I didn't even care about having in the first place I just wanted my nose to be straight and deal with the rest later. I was put in a maxillary distractor (fancy name for cage on my head). To move my upper jaw forward so that they can reconstruct the palate (roof of my mouth) and straighten jaw or whatever they were doing I have no clue and it seemed unnessesary to me. It did however improve my speech just a tiny bit. I had to wear this crap o. My head for 4 months. Later I then made my own appointments 2 years later (22) and got a surgery for bonegraft. I am still missing the tooth implant which I cannot afford nor will I ever be able to, and I have to have another surgery on my nose again. I have always suffered from depression because of this but not only because of my unfortunate medical circumstances. (Also I have been getting pains around my abdominal area so either I've got something going on down there that shouldn't be or when I was born the doctors decided it be best to stick a penis on me and call me a boy).

As for the other reasons why I'm highly depressed and on the verge of collapsing. I was forced by my stepdad to go into debt. I wanted to go to college but I wanted to do it like everyone else, a real place surrounded by real people so I can maybe make atleast one friend and not be a total failer. Of course my luck hits home again and he forced me to go to an online college with the promiss of letting me use the money the army provides to him for school use. I agree and then he turns and days ""yea no... Do it yourself"". Landing me 16k debt that I can't pay, 3k I was forced to pay (just to get my diploma) and 3k my mom was forced to pay for me to be able to enroll in classes. Before this though I was planning to join the military to get a one up on life, but apparently not God's plan. Since when I brought up the idea he straight refused. I was not allowed to work or go out, I did not have an allowance or any type of money except money I got for my birthday ($20 every year, ages 18-19-20) and it didn't help that I had no friends up until senior year in highschool (that summer is the only happy memories I have after leaving my home town. He was very controlling that's why I feel I can't do anything without the constant reminder of all the trauma I've faced.

I did however keep the promis I made to myself about joining the military. Unfortunately though I was not let in. After two years of waiting and providing all of the medical paperwork I was finally sent to MEPS for the Marines, finally a chance for me to straighten out my life and man up and get all these rediculous thoughts and feelings out my head. NOPE! Once I get there I take the ASVAP and score on the higher side (I know right smarts actually came in handy I might look like a retard but my mental capacity is on the higher side) scored 80. Go through medical everything good up until the physical, the doctor asks me if I always been tall and skinny (I have a very feminine body besides the lack of breasts and having a penis) I say yes, normal ok cool then I go to the eye exam and they tell me I have astigmatism in my left eye (this I knew it happened when I was about 5 or so, started hallucinating and seeing giant spiders with extream detail) I went to see if I can get this fixed they said and I quote ""the damage to your eye is so savire that we do not have the equipment required to even make a dent of progress, the best solution I can offer is to use the effected eye and hope it gets better over time, sorry but there is nothing we can do for you at this time."" - Lasik doctor. So dream job at Marines = no go. The MEPS people tell me to try the army cause they accept pretty much anyone. I do and same thing they say I can't join because of my stupid eye, gee thanks God. 

At this point I start thinking maybe it's not meant to be and give up. 

My job history is halarious, atleast to me. Almost even didn't get hired. First job at age 20, McDonald's. Mom gets a house with my brother who got to live my fantasy of being in the military and travel the world, who then decides to mock me and make my life even worse by deciding he needs a surgery on his penis (he thought it was so curved he can't have sex yet he never tried, now he's depressed and thinks he can never have it and the doctor messed up, doctor also gave him circomsition) this happened during my attempt at joining the Marines. Throughout the course of 6 months he would constantly scream at the top of his lungs and say how God hates him, this is punishment, lash out at me for no reason, and make me feel not only unsafe but want to take my own life even more just to get out of that situation. Once we move into the new house this continues along with me every day for months on end calming him down explaining and telling him to be patient cause it's not gunna heal right away and healing of the body depends on the mind state anyways. Because of the move I am forced to quit my job that I actually enjoyed, to transfer to another McDonald's on the side of town we moved to (two towns down) I work there for 6 months before quitting because of how unfairly I was being treated, everything was my fault, I never did anything right, I was lazy, the works (even though I did mainly everybody's job in the kitchen, everyday I washed the grill swept mopped multiple times a day, I would be on grill then on the table making the burgers, I'd go and get the 50 pound boxes from the freezer. You name it I did it.) I eventually quit after 6 months bought a one way ticket to California and said my goodbyes to my brother who called my mom crying saying I left and he tried to stop me... I was sick of his shit. I had shit I was dealing with all my life and now I have to deal with you and your problem too, (excuse the langauge but) fuck outta here with that shit. 
I have so little control over my own life that I only spent 2 days in California before my mom told the entire family where I was and got my aunt (grandma's sister so technically grandma, who's also a nun) to somehow convince me to go to New York and stay with my uncle. I can't believe I actually fell for their stupid guilt trip but somehow after only 5 days I was off to NYC. I told myself it's probably best since there are lots of opportunities for me to be a musican. Wrong. I was basically plummited into the same exact situation with different people. Greedy money hungry aunt, no jobs, no money, an uncle who works at night sleeps durring the day, wierd daughter that turned into her mother. I had to get outta there it got to the point where she was looking through my stuff while I wasn't there to find proof I could pay her $700 to stay in the shitty, stinky room they kept rabbits in. With a door that locks from the outside and a broken window, very small room at that. After two months of looking for jobs while making music simaltaniously I am being called a liar I good for nothing a lazy bum you name it that's what she labeled me. I manage to get a job at McDonald's again but in NY. I manage to set up the bonegraft appointment and lay on an air mattress for two weeks feeling useless and being called useless. I go back to work and then move into my grandpa's room he was renting. Lucky for me he was on vacation for the next two months. Durring this time when my granpa came back j felt obligated and wanted to help with his bills ultimately giving him what little I had. 4 months pass and after much consideration and mom/brother begging for me to come back I oblige. 
I then get a job at another McDonald's in the next town over oppisate direction with the help of my old boss. I work there for 6 months before quitting because of the same drama the first time and hearing people continuously talking shit about me making me feel terrible about myself even more and with the emense parinoia I was experiencing due to smoking too much (the parinoia was about how I hid the fact I'm not normal and that I wish to be a girl and intricate details of my life).

If you think that's it well your wrong... My aunt comes to the USA on a visa and is put in a shit situation feeling unsafe, according to her. My mom is the only one in the USA she knows, mom folds and buys her a plane ticket to stay here for the time being, money my mom didn't have, which is fine desperate times desperate measures and such. She stays here for an entire month and quickly realises there is nothing here, everything is far and you have to drive everywhere. The time that she was here I could have used to work on my music the 3 hours I was left alone in the house, but no. 
Everything that she bought or well made me buy she complains and says it's for someone else, complains she didn't buy anything for herself and how she had to use my mom's clothes cause instead of buy things for herself she bought for everyone else supposedly. She then says how she needs a phone and makes me go find one for her. After I go through the trouble of finding and iPhone 7 plus for a crazy deal ($150) which they usually go for 300-350 I go and I borrow money to go get her the phone. She then says oh... I wanted a more modern one....like yours.... I'm like ugh ok I reset mine give her it and she then says she will give me the 150 (my phone was iPhone X pristine condition). Months pass I still don't have a job (stopped looking to focus on getting my licence), everybody keeps making excuses not to teach me, and the piece of crap car that my brother was going to pass down to me needs a new battery so I can't use it, and he also decided to retract the offer before I got the chance to use it and is selling it because he doesn't want to pay for it. He is not rich but wealthy $40k in the bank meanwhile I'm 30k in debt 12 of which collectors are being sent now. 

Debt - borrowed money I didn't have to help pay bills to not be called worthless and useless. Borrowed too much then took 5k out and ran away to California

That brings me to the present day, some details have been left out as to not make this extreamly long.
(Side note: I have always liked girls but it's more like an admiration/envy type of thing, always wishing I was one cause I always felt just wrong in my own body)

"Granted I'm known by many acquaintances but have zero friends. I am often repeating myself because so called friends don't listen or dont hear me or frankly, don't give a shit. I've been suffering from bipolar disorder, manic depression, for upwards of 18 years. I told myseld if I could just make it past 27 yrs things would get better. I've been hospitalized, most recently in September 2019, the staff basically said they don't treat us but just monitor us until we are stable on meds and fit to leave. I have no family, raised in the foster care system and I'm completely alone. I don't see the point in living anymore if I'm constantly in mental agony or being ignored or used on every level. I've taken care of people I thought were friends because I have so much love to give but misguided as usual I end up used and thrown out like a tissue or ignored blatantly. I can't keep a job so my stability is often rocked by my own uncontrollable emotions and outbursts and I can't cope anymore. I'm losing hope and honestly just would like someone to acknowledge that I am alive and a sensitive but real person. Even then I don't know how to curb the feelings and thoughts of suicide. My closest friends growing up have all passed, either by suicide or excessive drug use I'm honestly debating the same path because without them I'm more alone than ever. 
Idk if reddit is the place for this but at the very least I'm getting this out and have one outlet to speak on my real feelings. I've sought therapy and a psych for meds but it seems like they never want to hear the bad or try to ""silver lining"" my struggles by saying I'm so strong....I'm tired, no exhausted, from being so strong.

"I'm 28m, I moved back in with my parents when my house was sold out from under me. I've been slowly deteriorating. I've considered suicide since I was in middleschool. And attempted sometimes halfheartedly, a handful of times.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel empty. Like I don't belong. I have been single for the last 6 years. Not counting short relationships. I haven't gone to college. I have no desire to continue living.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger suicide was a strong but fleeting feeling. It would hit me like a train but if I held on for long enough it would disappear like a light being switched off. As I grow older it seems that those feelings that before were quick, are no constant. Suicide is almost always on my mind. And my determination to succeed seems to have strengthened. 


I have very little to complain about in life. I have a job, I'm saving money. I have some fantastic friends, and I live in a beautiful part of the world. 


I am alone though. Every attempt I've made at having a relationship with a woman has failed. Not always because of me. But the feeling of being empty and alone is unbearable. Partnership is hardwired into our dna and I seem to have been born into the perfect brain for avoiding it.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do. I want to end it. I'm worried what it might do to my parents. They are already on the edge of a divorce that I believe has been coming since I was very young. They have already shown themselves to be fairly incapable when it comes to helping me with my mental issues. They knew I had ADD as a child but did nothing about it. Hoping it would go away. They've taken me to therapy for my depression, but I find it difficult to be honest about my feelings when I'm face to face with someone. Because the few times I have been, it has lead to a response consisting of distance, and 5, not compassion or empathy. And even more often the simple words ""suck it up"".

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fairly sure I'll die by suicide. Likely within the next few years. My only goal is to try and patch up my relationships with family and loved ones so that I can send myself off with the least amount of guilt possible. I don't want to tear peoples lives apart. I just wish I had never been born. I don't feel lovable. I don't feel as if I can really trust anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I should fight it. But after 28 years. I don't know if I have the strength. I just want to stop feeling alone, and empty.",5
"I don't know if anyone will even read this, but I need to vent somewhere. For some background, I am now living back in my home state, in an unhappy situation, because I wanted to come back and finish up school and so that I could be around my family.

Originally, I moved away for a few years. I was unhappy before I left my home, and I found real happiness out west in Colorado for a time. I began traveling around, working seasonal jobs at ski resorts and in national parks, and I really enjoyed it for awhile. I just wanted to keep traveling, but then the realities of life set in.

I didn't have a degree, I wasn't in any sort of high-paying jobs, and I was struggling to make it paycheck to paycheck. Despite all of this, I was still relatively happy. Eventually though, I realized that I missed my family and my old friends terribly, and decided to move back so that I could be around them and get an education.

Fast forward to now. I'm 26 years old, living at my dad's house, working in an unfulfilling job that pays terribly, while I wait for my first semester of school to start. I feel like an absolute failure because I won't even have a degree until I'm 30. I won't start my career until almost a decade after everyone else did. I miss what I was doing and the places I traveled through so terribly much. I feel like I'm missing a part of myself by being back here and I left it out west.

I have considered moving back, but I have no idea how I would afford it, and I don't see any career opportunities for me outside of dead-end, low paying jobs out there. Also, if I don't do school now, then I don't think I ever will. If I moved back out, I would just go back to seeing my family once a year for two or three days, and I love them so much. That was the hardest part of being out there, and I want to be able to see them regularly. I'm extremely close to my parents, and I don't want to miss a moment with them, because I realize that they will be gone some day. Every moment with them is precious.

But, I feel like I'm slowly dying here. I am turned into a depressed, cynical person who cannot see the good in life anymore. Everything is negative, and the people around me in this state are so ignorant and offensive. I don't belong here, and I don't know what to do. Grappling with this indecision has been so unbelievably hard on me.

If I stay, then I will just become more and more unhappy. If I leave, then I will never be able to see my parents, and I will be unhappy again because of that. I can't take it anymore. Looking ahead, my life seems like it is going to be one endless stream of depression and I honestly just want it to end.

Please, help me. I don't know what to do anymore and it feels like I'm going insane just battling with my own thoughts all day",2
"I just can't stop thinking about it, it's constant, it's all i think about. Before i sleep, when i wake up, and whenever my minds not totally occupied. Sometimes i contemplate suicide: the action then followed by thoughts of an afterlife, if there's even one. I can never stop obsessing over it and normally i'm the one giving advice such as life and so forth, but recently i've been actually contemplating â€œwhat happens when we're all dead?â€ and that just keeps me up and thinking every moment. This is made worse by people telling me â€œdon't worry it'll all be okayâ€ or â€œjust live life to the fullestâ€ something cheesy and dumb. Quite honestly, if life is as pointless as i think and as it seems, aren't we just better off dead? To live is to suffer, pain after pain, at what gain? The humiliation and satisfaction of nothing short of a horrible life. The experiences all meaning nothing once we're gone, and yet we're all still here? Why? Just why? If there was any way out i think sometimes cutting it short would be the only. I just can't see wading thru this torture we call life as an option.",5
"I realized recently that I might have bipolar disorder based on a couple of friends I know who have it and also the symptom checklists that I have looked at. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety as depression but lately it's felt more than that, particularly in the swings between extreme optimism and sociability, and pessimism's day depression. 

Anyways I was looking online and found an online counseling website. One of the boxes you have to fill out is info that the counselor will look over in order to have a better understanding upfront. As I was filling it out I poured my heart into it and explained my feelings better than I ever had to anyone before, even myself. I was feeling like there was hope in figuring out what the fucks going on in my head. Then I hit the â€œnext pageâ€ button and it brought me to the payment section.

Never did the website mention that it was a paid thing up until this page. I understand that it's a business and the counselors have to get paid somehow in order to not do a completely shit job, but the fact that they didn't mention that until you've already broken yourself down and opened up really pissed me off. It felt like they were saying, â€œokay what's going on, what's wrong? Oh no that's unfortunate, now before I give you any help for all of the super personal stuff you just opened up to me about, I'm gonna need your credit card info. Oh you can't afford it, well fuck off then.â€ 

It's 3:23 am where I live and I feel completely stuck. I am a college student working two jobs just trying to make ends meet while also juggling the exhausting unpredictable bullshit in my head everyday, and the fact that I have to pay for help with something I didn't ask for and wouldn't wish on my worst enemy kind of astounds me at the moment. I don't know where I'd be if I had visited the site without the semi level head that I have right now and had been hit with that price tag for my well being. 

I don't want to get too political on this sub but honestly fuck capitalism right now 

End of vent gonna delete this tomorrow when the other side of my personality gets mad for posting this 

Hope you all have a good and safe night",3
"I dont know if this is the right sub, I just need a place to vent right now.

So, I dont know where to start. I have been depressed for over 6 years now, but always managed to see the good things in life. But for the last 2 months it got worse. I randomly have the urge to just cry all day long. I've just been holding it back, which probably isn't such a good idea. Also, I still live with my mom, and every time I get home, she just yells at me. In the last 3 weeks I got really tired. As soon as I get home I just lay down in bed and try to relax, and even my vision is getting darker I think. I dont know what's going on with me and i dont think I can keep going much longer.",5
"I feel the depression crawling back right how. I could feel my heart getting heavier by the day. I'm feelin stressed, tired, sick, and sleepy all at the same time. I'm having more bad days then good and it doesn't feel fun to wake up. I'm not looking forward to the day like I did a while ago. Need ideas, inspiration, advice, anything to help me get out of this funk. 
Stopped seeing my therapist last month due to money/funding. I've been going on and off for 5 years, the past 2 years have been consecutive. Is it normal to feel like this after you stop therapy?",5
"I wish I could've done something with myself like become stronger and stop myself becoming a problem. I wish I could've done alot of stuff but now im here contemplating if I should end it all so I have nothing to lose now then later, and I know my family would be sad but they already talk about me behind my back about how much of a pain i am, and there is no way I am going to let them know about how I feel on the inside right now. Im at my breaking point and all I wish for is to be left alone to perish, I know it's selfish but I never asked to be here in the first place.",5
"You've probably haven't heard from me since I made that concerning post awhile ago, then me deleting it. Welp I'm alive still, but I was very close to ending it today. My head was spiraling more than I've ever felt, and light started to blur and noise was distorted. Keep in mind, I wasn't dying or gaining out of consciousness, I was just walking around my school and I heard the noise of a helicopter, while the sunset was gleaming in my eye. I was just trying to find that damn helicopter since that noise was just consuming me, and my whole world was vanishing, and I lost my meaning completely. I just wanted to end it. I didn't know how, but I knew I wouldn't be alive tomorrow. My mind was gone.

I then sat down and cried. Through the hole of the tables outside, I saw a pair of converse. While crying and trying to hide my tears from the cheer team that just got back from practice, I saw friend's converse who had just came back from 711. They were surprised to see me there, and gave me the rest of their iced coffee. They didn't know I was crying since I played it off that I was sleeping. We spent another 30 minutes eating brownies and talking about our day.

I don't think I've ever appreciated a person so much in my life. I never knew that the person who saved me would be the one I would least expect. 

I owe them my life.",5
"It's your average story everyone's heard: no friends, broken family, bullied throughout elementary and high school, rough breakup, only escapes through drugs and self harm. I just can't take it anymore i feel so worthless, I'm turning 18 this year and i think i can no longer go on like this i've wanted to die since i was 11. why is life so painful every day is a constantly struggle for me and i can't even find motivation to keep going on. I cant even picture myself as an adult, i see nothing. These are all just words i cant even put together properly without autocorrect cause i'm crying too much, i just want to feel okay. How does being loved feel like? I've only felt it once with someone who changed their mind and started caring about somebody else in that particular way and broke off all contact with me. I'm so tired of people giving me â€œtough loveâ€ and saying my decisions are selfish, i know i am, it's just making it worst. I just want it all to stop, but it never did. â€œIt gets betterâ€ is burned into my mind but when does it? I've been trying so hard to continue on and make improvements but it always ends back at square one. I've never been this insistent on dying in my life, there are only liars and shitty people on this earth. Nobody seems to care or listen unless there's something in for them",4
"I hate my life so much I question why I'm even here sometimes , like what's the mandatory policy to life? which way should you go? well when ur born everyone tells you the ideal path in life. Go to school, Get a job, Settle down, Start a Family and so on ... well I'm a fucking piece of shit and already started fucking up my whole life and I wanna take it back I mean for god sake I don't even have someone I can express this crisis too I gotta go on the Internet and spill my heart out to feel content with how I'm feeling and I'm feeling fucking overwhelmed. like no one cares right? no dude, no one fucking cares and that's when I go back to my first statement why am I here anyways? to do drugs, to have an abusive â€œboyfriendâ€ that can give less of a fuck when u wake up in the middle of the night crying because you're overthinking everything you scared yourself wide awake? Because no one should even care in the first place, but what's a life that's so empty no one can even comfort you? but again that's life no ones suppose to actually give a fuck about you all you got is yourself and when you realize that it gets even more lonely. I'm to the point where I'm scared of life and don't wanna live it but scared of what happens when it ends anyways. What if I die without really living out my full potential because I already lived it out ? was my purpose so little I didn't even get to realize it before I died? I don't know I just know life isn't easy but no one said it was, it just looked that way when things were easier, when people still cared and the world seemed so curious there were a million possibilities life could take you but now you just worry away because all the people the cared are gone and now all the curiosity went away because you've seen all the ugly in the world and nothing looks beautiful anymore. maybe I'm just depressed and can't ever really be happy ? I haven't felt genuine happiness without drugs in such a long time maybe I'm defective. I don't even think anyone cares enough to even read this much but if you did and you're reading this thank you for hearing me out this actually helped a bit.",5
"I'm rewatching Bojack Horseman on Netflix for the umpteenth time because that's the only thing I do that I enjoy anymore. 

I've recently noticed that in the show Secretariat is right, that you should never stop ruining, never look back, all that you have is what's ahead. That's what I've been doing and it seems to be working as long as I don't stop. 

My last relationship almost killed me, my ex was abusive. Before her I survived since shit, sexual assaults and the like. I've done terrible things too, things for survival, some things simply because I was a bastard.

Now i keep myself busy. I work 50+ hrs and volunteer for the entire weekend. I have pets that need constant attention, and I'm constantly moving. When I'm not running around I always have a drink in hand. It works. The only time I look back is when I'm falling asleep, that's the worst. That's when I can't escape it. Thankfully sleep cones soon. But I need to keep moving. If I stop I'll be consumed. Im terrified of that. I can't handle that. I can't relive it, I just can't. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I come from a long line of alcoholics and I'm fast on my way to join them. I'm so tired but I can't risk showing down. I just wish it would end but I'm too scared to do anything about it. I'm ruining as fast and as hard as I can but I'm slowing down and it's catching up. I thought it would get easier but it isn't.",1
"I've been *somewhat* suicidal myself. More so in the â€œIm in so much pain I want to stop existingâ€ than having a plan to end it all kind of way. 

I love someone dearly who has attempted suicide more than once and been hospitalized after their attempts. They also struggle with addiction.

I've also lost someone I love to suicide. 

They've called me, more than once, often drunk or high, sometimes not, telling me goodbye, this was the end, and this was their plan (I don't know if specific phrases are allowed, so to generalize, the gist is I have all I need to kill myself readily accessible/I am in the location where I'm going to kill my self and when we hang up I'm going to do it) 

Sometimes, I'm close enough that I can physically go to be with them. Sometimes I'm not. 

Every time, I feel like their life is in my hands. That's not a responsibility I feel like I can handle. If something were to happen to them, I'd feel entirely responsible. 

I feel like I've read so much that suggestions to seek professional help aren't helpful and the last thing to do is call the police or emergency services... but I am so scared. I love my friend and I want them to know it. I want them to know how truly I support them and don't blame them for what they're feeling or think they're doing anything wrong. Because I truly don't.

But I can't handle feeling like their life is in my hands. I can't handle feeling like if I say the wrong thing or don't say the RIGHT thing and they die, it's on me because I'm the one they chose to come to for help. I feel like I can't be the help in these situations, but I don't want to turn them away when they clearly need someone. 

It would be different if it wasn't an active plan. I'm comfortable with I want to die sentiments. I'm comfortable with listening to someone talk about their deep pain and hatred towards themselves or ambivalence towards life. But the goodbye. The plan. The â€œI'm dead after we hang upâ€ .... I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I feel like I HAVE to take that seriously, because if I don't, and they die... I have no words for what would come next.

Anyway. Any advice about any of this is appreciated.",3
There's literally no point in life. We live and we die. And life has been hell to me so far so why should I even bother finishing. I am almost at the point where I'm about to say fuck it and quit.,5

"So first of all, I don't know if this is a rule or not, but I've never been to a doctor's and actually got confirmed to have depression, I have anxiety issues and likely agoraphobia, I haven't left the house for 4 years, even then it only lasted a month, since before that I hadn't left the house in 5 years. Even before that, I didn't receive a high school education as I spent it all, you guessed it, in my house.

There was a small portion in my life where I actually had friends, 10 years ago, I was active, ""fun"", enjoying my life fairly well but occasionally I was still in the dumps. Most of my friends seemed to be the same way so we talked about it a lot. Of course my friend at the time tried to encourage me, tell me it gets better and kept an eye on me to make sure I was coming out of my shell so to say.

So of course I fucked that up, I made a small mistake, said sorry, they forgave me and I punished myself by not allowing myself to see my friends. Still haven't seen them to this day, besides one, my so. Somehow, they have infinite patience and can put up with all my shit.

I punished myself a lot, I'd cut myself, I'd punch and slam myself, destroy my own possessions. My so tried their best and it sort of fizzled out. These days I don't get the will to do so anymore.

Ever since then, nothing, for a whole 10 years, most of it I didn't even spend time with my mother and younger sister. Maybe I was still punishing myself. I had few hobbies or even things to do, though I didn't fully enjoy any of it, I was starting to feel pretty emotionless.
Towards the end I actually started reconnecting with my mother and finally learning stuff and just starting to connect with my sister.

It was going fairly well for me, I was starting to look at the bright side, I still never left my house but it was starting to feel comfortable instead of a prison.

But then my sister did something unspeakable, something I don't think I could ever forgive, but my mother did, instantly. I was hurt, angry and it pulled me straight back. Ever since I've been weird around my sister, finding it almost impossible to connect and angry at my mother.

So now, I just feel numb, I really don't know what to do, I've been trying to forgive and forget but it's impossible. I've been trying to go outside but I almost have panic attacks just thinking about it sometimes. I'm back to the prison with nothing to do but wait.

Tl:Dr After many years, things started to look good until family trouble, now it's worse than ever.",4
I've been suicidal for such a long time now. I see my therapist and psychiatrist weekly. I was in the hospital for 4 days a couple weeks ago. I'm on a shit ton of meds. I don't see any other way out. I don't think it'll happen this week but I can't promise next week. I have no passion for anything in my life nor do I have fun anymore. And I'm so good at hiding it all. It's not that I don't have friends or family that don't care. I have both. But I just don't see any other way out because nothing on this earth matters.,5
"Well, good evening ladies and gentlemen. 

Tonight i'm going to kill myself. There is no 
hope or desire to continue breathing. Loneliness does not want or plan to get away from me and I have already tried everything to escape but i will always be alone. I do not seek attention, advice, or a savior. All I want is to say goodbye, at least, to strangers who, in the same way if they knew me, would reject me. I am an extremely disposable being.

I feel very calm and I would like to hope with the idea that, when I die, I will be much calmer, but I cannot. I really don't want to die, but my life has no solution. Nobody can help me.

So, goodbye.",5

"Hey. After much meditation, I decided to create this post, both as therapy for myself and to open up a forum of conversation. I am writing this right before I go to work, so I will probably edit it later. So here it goes. I apologize in advance for my rambling. 

I am currently 20 years old and a sophomore in college. A few minutes ago I typed in â€œI'm eventually going to kill myselfâ€ into google trying to find some forum post to read. Lo and behold an r/suicidewatch post came up from 3 years ago, which led to me creating my reddit account to make this post.

Throughout my life so far, I have struggled from a crippling loneliness. I was mostly a loner in middle school and high school, one of those arrogant assholes who only care about grades, etc. Inside, however, I had a crippling insecurity about my body image. I have a distinct memory from when I was perhaps 10-11 of staring into the mirror and looking at my face, critiquing every last bit. To those I know, this would not make much sense as I have always been told that I am very attractive. I have never seen it, however. My phone, to this day, is filled with photos that I have taken of myself. 

Deep down, I think that my depression is mostly of a natural physiological basis. Up until I was 18 I had never even held a girl's hand and up to now I have only kissed one (a very pretty Italian girl who left the country soon after). I have spent most of the last 2 years listening to sad songs, driving aimlessly, chain smoking, and watching movies like Her and Manchester by the Sea. Luckily enough, I do have a best friend that I met in HS who struggles with depression as well. He however, has no problem picking up girls do to his charisma that he has developed over the years as a coping mechanism. Together, we mostly drink, smoke weed, and watch â€œfilms.â€ I always make it a point to get drunk or high enough that my entire life, past and future, flashes before me in a sort of slideshow. 

As I write this, I have been using steroids on and off for 2.5 years. I first started after losing 25 pounds (mostly by starving myself) and then developing an ok physique. I thought that nothing else would make me attractive so I made the decision to buy Testosterone Enanthate off the darknet when I was 17. I didn't give a shit if I died because, in my mind, there was no other way to find a girl to fill the void inside of me. Now, I am very muscular (5'10'', 190, around 10% bf), yet my void is not filled and I don't think it ever will be. 
I am on a solid trajectory right now and will inherit a large sum from my grandfather when I turn 25. This adds no meaning to my life, however. I see myself as a sort of Holden Caulfield or Amory Blaine (from this side of paradise). All I want to do is help people and be loved, but I have a crippling fear that I will only feel loved vicariously, by watching movies and reading books. I can't shake the feeling that I won't make it past 40 before I eventually kill myself. My father is currently slowly dying of alcoholism from his depression at 50 just as his father did.

Every time I think of this I am taken back to a memory from when I was a senior in HS. I had been talking to a girl for a month or two and my best friend had hid the fact that he was having sex with her. I had never felt so inadequate in my life. I drove home crying and tied my belt around the doorknob and leaned forward. Thankfully I didn't follow through with it. This inadequacy still consumes me. I just want hope that someday these feelings will subside.",1
"I'm suicidal because, of, 


I failed graduating many times, school. 

How my dad treats me, bullying me. 

How I make myself feel awful by judging myself all the time, me. 

I'm unmotivated in school, I dread school, I hate school.

I'm a highly sensitive person, hsp. I'm a procrastinator.

"I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. 

Thanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness. Along with having a parent who doesn't make your suffering all about them and why you shouldn't be depressed.",2

"So many people have experienced it, and so many more *don't even realize* that they have. We were too young to remember, or we think that one thing that happened doesn't count, or we are in denial that that's what it truly was. But our body remembers. Our bodies and our souls, they carry the heaviness of the pain that we can never seem to put down. I believe that most of the times people want to end their lives, even if they are doing it slowly through addictions or passive behaviors, it's for this reason. 

Whether we were manipulated, tricked, forced, brutalized, lied to, used and discarded... all of these actions cut deep, to the very core of our being, and it feels like there's no way to ever move past them. When there's nothing else to distract us, the weight is unbearable.",0
"I don't have the strength or really the means to do it right. I just want instant death when I least expect it. I don't feel like I'm supposed to be alive, every day is completely miserable. Most days have always been at the very least not good. The months are just passing by now, I haven't had a real friend in years. My girlfriend lives hundreds of miles away and it feels like she doesn't care anymore about me because of how I am. I don't even blame her. I'm ready to die, it's just so hard to do so. Every day I look at suicide methods and and it's the same fucking articles and posts. It's almost funny. I stopped taking my useless antidepressants because I was tired of being asexual, now I have these brain zaps and it's so weak. I just laugh or cry for no reason at times.

"I have no one to listen to my problems so I thought I would write them down. Then I decided to post it on here. 

Just moved to a new city and started at a new school. I don't miss anything from my old hometown, I'm actually quite happy to be somewhere else. Moving has been tough though. I had to give up my cat and say goodbye to my friends.

I have kind of 'joined' a group of friends at school. They're all pretty nice. The dynamic of the group is a little weird though. Its like 50% introverts who don't talk much, myself included, and 50% strongly opinionated extroverts. They mostly seem like a nice group of people though. In regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. Trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. It's hard not to get impatient and blame myself though. I feel like I'm being ungrateful because even though I think I've been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what I want, I still feel so shit.

I've never been diagnosed but I think I could have depression and/or anxiety. I would love to get some medication if it would ease the pain, but I don't want to tell my parents how I feel.

Over the past few years I've thought of suicide probably at least once a month, usually weekly or daily though, and planned it two or three times in my life. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. I've been researching pills I can get at a chemist that I could overdose on and I've found a suicide bridge that's very close to my house. I've been told that I should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments doesn't seem worth it sometimes.

I'm starting to find it hard to trust myself. I'm like a different person from day to day, or even hour to hour. During the brief moments when I feel happy about something I worry about my emotions causing me to do something I regret. When I'm sad or empty it's all I can think about.

There's this girl who's not in my new social circle but who has been really nice to me. She seems like a really nice person. We don't see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. I'm unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it's making me dizzy. I really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but I am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake I make. I feel kind of like It'll never happen, yet I spent the whole afternoon texting her. I feel like I'm going insane.

The people I admire most are the ones that seem like the nicest people you could ever know and make you feel happy just being present or after a short conversation and you're always left wanting more from them. I aspire to be like this and make other people happy. I need to remember to smile more though.

Usually I have a high libido but the past two weeks my drive has literally been non-existent. A month ago my shit suddenly became sloppy even though my diet is quite healthy and hasn't changed much, I think it is anxiety causing me to be extremely tense all the time. I just started waking up at 4am every morning out of nowhere and I can't stop. I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.

I feel so lonely. I just want someone to talk to and listen to. Getting to that point with someone new takes time and I'm getting kind of impatient.

I don't know what to do to make myself happy. If things worked out with this girl I think I would be happier, yet the thought of her losing interest in me makes me feel awful.

Wow, this ended up really long.",5
"Throwaway account. Not like it matters. Today I wrote suicide notes to my mom and boyfriend. I feel so guilty but things have really taken a bad turn and I can't do it anymore.

But if I'm being honest, I don't know if I can stick around that long. It keeps getting worse. I hate feeling this way.",5
"It seems like all I do is cry. I needed my cello bow re-haired so my professor sent me to an unfamiliar building and gave me instructions to drop it off at some lady's office. I was already having a bad day because I couldn't get myself out of bed to go to my first class. Then she tells me that she can't accept the bow because I need to visit the website first, set up an account, etc. At that point I start crying. It ended up working out in the end but I wish that every little thing didn't have to make me sad.",5
"We have been together for almost four years and I had never been happier in my life than I have been since I met him. He has helped and encouraged me to improve and grow so much. He has never insulted me, never yelled at me, and while we've had disagreements we've never *fought*. There has always been so much love here.

I want to spend the rest of my life with him. I thought he wanted the same. He says that he does.

However, he also says that he can't be satisfied sexually with just me. He wants an open relationship so he can fool around with cis men. I'm transgender, and it's killing me that he wants the one body part that I don't have more than he wants to be happy with me.

He doesn't believe our relationship is sustainable, and he can't promise he won't one day be tempted to cheat, if he doesn't ""have this outlet."" He won't marry me unless I can agree to the open relationship. I'm a deeply monogamous person and just can't do it. I can't.

I never believed that anyone could love me; I have multiple sclerosis and am trans, along with a ton of other issues. He has made me so happy, and I felt so loved and secure, just to learn that he isn't satisfied with me and never will be. As I always feared, I'm just not good enough.

We're in couples counseling, he wants to make things work somehow, but I can't see any possible solution even though I want nothing more than him. I hate my body more than ever before. I hate myself.

I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 20 years. I believe this was my last chance, and it is failing horribly, and I just don't have it in me to keep trying.",4
"First of all, sorry... I'm Brazilian and my english is broken.

I'm 26 years old, I think I'm beautiful and I look younger, but I've been in severe depression for over ten years because of family losses and my borderline disorder, and I think I was born mentally ill. I was hospitalized in 2016 and 2017 and under psychiatric treatment, but I think that I have no cure. 

I stopped going to university, I stopped working, everything goes wrong, but last year I thought everything was going to change. I met someone and helped him, gave him house, food, love and my family accepted him, but he made it worse, made me go through hell, left me at the rock bottom, and then this year he left, he left me!! Now he is living a happy life and I that helped him.. well I'm living in chaos. 

THAT'S NOT FAIR! WHY EVERYTHING GOES WRONG IN MY LIFE?

I love my family, my 25 cats and I still love him. But I can't go on anymore. I feel exhausted and too old.",3
Right now I'm feeling very alone I live in a city and don't know very many people because with depression and anxiety that I haven't treated for 7 years keeps me from wanting to meet new people because out in the real world it's scary. Always afraid that I will mess up what I say and that people will think I'm stupid. The people I do know half turned out to be horrible people that have now resorted to trying to tear me down daily. I love my daughter and my boyfriend but sometimes you want to talk to someone else. I don't know how else to explain it I just feel really trapped. End sad rant.,5

Constantly feeling gutted by the very act of existence. Life is pain. It's not worth it and I know I'm worthless. I'm a fuck up going nowhere. I don't want to breathe I don't want to think I don't want to feel anymore. I don't want to be me. I hate myself. I loathe myself. I am a piece of shit.

"I'm 16 I've been severely suicidal since I was 10. When I was around 11 I slit my wrists and my parents walked in when I was bleeding out. They said they were â€˜busy' working and gave me antiseptic cream and bandaids instead of taking me to the hospital my dad walked in later that night and cried over me and basically called me selfish. No one ever talked about it again and I never received help. I'm now in 11th grade and school has never been worse I've already had 2 pretty serious breakdowns and I'm only 6 weeks in. Through extensive online research I found some â€˜painless' suicide methods and purchased the drugs and blades necessary to pull it off. I almost did it the other night but I want to finalise some things first. My mum is gone so just now I went to my dad for a final plea for help and when I told him he said â€œit's all in your headâ€ â€œ the 
only thing you have is self pityâ€ etc. I just know I'm going to end it all pretty soon, I'm not sure when but almost definitely soon. Thx for reading if you made it this far :) appreciate it",1
"It's not that I hate working but... no, it is precisely that I hate working. I just can't come to terms with the thought that I'm going to waste a huge part of my life doing things I don't like to do. 
For what? I don't see the point on working hard and achieving all these career goals if the only time I'm going to have to myself would be after I retire â€” IF I'm ever going to retire and not just drop dead in my 50/60s. 
I'm 27 and I have no idea how to live this life, my supposedly only chance at sentience. I'm depressed due to a lot of things: physical health problems, not being able to find a job that I'm going to at least tolerate, feeling generally lost in life.
I hated all the jobs I've been at, ALL OF THEM. It majorly contributed to my suicidal tendencies and I quit my last job with this awful premonition that if I'm not going to quit asap, I'm going to kill myself. 
My family doesn't understand because 'Everybody's gotta work for a living' (the usual), they kind of resent me now for being like this. I'd gladly drink all the Kool-Aid of this world and be a relatively happy working drone at this point in my life, but my mind just isnt wired that way.
I'm tired of constantly feeling depressed, guilty, angry at this world and myself. I feel absolutely alone, even thought I know that I'm not alone in this type of thinking.
Right now I just feel empty, like there's no way out of this, lile I have nothing to live for.

There's no hope left, there's nothing more for me to try. I've been fighting depression for nearly a decade. So many different therapists, coping mechanisms, meds of different kinds and different doses. And here I am. 8 years later and in more pain than ever. I wanted to get better so bad. But it's not possible. It's just not possible. There's nothing anymore. I dropped out of school. I have no job. No friends. I'm quickly running out of money.

"28F. My husband wanted to move from West coast to the East coast. Here we are 5 months later. I hate my job and most coworkers. I met a coworker I loved but she ended up leaving and now I have nothing to look forward to at work. I eat in my car I'd rather eat by myself than with gossiping, whining women.

My husband has always been a people person so hes made friends pretty quick. There's days were hes out and I'm sitting home alone. 

So alone. I cry in secret. I keep things to myself idk where I've gotten the idea that I need to be strong and crying is weakness.

I tried talking to my husband last night and I was having a hard time talking. He ended up leaving and just sleeping in the livingroom which didnt help this situation. 

I miss my mom
I miss my sister
I really fuckin miss my friends. God do I miss thier hugs so damn much
I miss my job it was an amazing job with great pay and my coworkers were my friends 
I miss our little home
I miss my car Lucy
I miss the weather

Burgers, wings, a lot of salty flavorful food and all that flavor has additives and msg n it fucks w ur brain chemistry I never ate my greens growing up after 2 days or eating salad and fruits and healthy fats and adding 2 tblspn of olive oil to the mixed helped me tremendously.. mood felt so much better!!! I used to be angry all the time also. Gluck

It's crazy I just drink 2 shakes a day made in a blender I just throw a bunch of salad and other greens along w a cut up whole apple ,orange, some carrots, broccoli, peanut butter, apple cider vinegar, hamulayian Salt and a tablespoon of olive oil. Twice a day

"Over the last few years, I've gone through various cycles of depression, anxiety &amp; panic attacks. I've fallen into the trap of everything's fine again i'm alright, only to be hit by a oncoming train of depression 6 months later. I spend a lot of time in my room alone &amp; I rarely leave the house much and when I do leave I feel massively anxious &amp; I feel much worse when dealing with people. I get hit sporadicly with depression &amp; insomnia, which makes everything so much worse. Insomnia has a truely wonderful talent of nuking everything.

I feel like I have no future and certainly no future or a life where i'm happy or even content. I've spoken to friends and loved ones about jobs and I always get the wishy-washy response of ""you'll be fine"" or ""everything will work out fine"". I want to have purpose in life but I just feel so incredibly hollow &amp; low all the time &amp; all my interests and hobbies just fade away. I'm absolutely terrified of applying for jobs (i've had a few interviews that completely nuked my mental health for more than a year) in fear that it's going to destroy my mental health again (had very bad experiences in my last job) and it doesn't help when friends/family tell me I need to apply or jobs or that i'm lazy. I really don't know what it is i'm suppose to do? or what it is that people think I should be doing? 

My biggest concern is that I just feel like if this is something I have to cope with for the rest of my life, I just don't think I'm going to be able to cope and I really worry where that will lead and what bearing it'll have on the important decisions in life. I'm really struggling to help myself and get help. Even writing this post has been hard (this is my fifth attempt) &amp; composing my thoughts has been really difficult. 

Has anyone had similar problems? or been in a similar situation and overcome it? I really don't want this but I feel like i'm stuck with it unable to do anything about it. I feel trapped, with nowhere to go.",2

"Ive been depressed for a couple of years now, ive been suicidal too for the past 3 years. One of the main reasons is my family. I'm an outsider to them, i chose that i don't want to be religious or what they wanted me to be. They tried to mould me into the model son, i hate it. Ive spoke on to a lot of people online, who've become my close friends, but in the beginning of this year, i lost my closest friend, of 3 years. He was an inspiration to me, and now that he's gone i feel alone. I have friends still but they slowly drift further each coming day.

Recently, i was telling dark jokes as a coping mechanism, it helps relieve stress when i make jokes about stuff. I slipped up and made a joke that offended a girl in my class, she went to the head of student affairs in my school and complained about me, despite having apologised at least 5 times. Parents got involved too, and news spreads like wildfire. I don't feel like going to school tomorrow, because the last thing i want is this stress from my peers.

Its not my peers that are the problem though, it's my family. They're religious and believe you should never joke about the stuff i do. (I still joke about the things i do because my mental state has deteriorated). I have depression, insomnia and ptsd. My family doesn't know. In about an hour i have to either confess everything that's wrong, which'll probably give me shit to deal with x20 worse, or i can kill myself today. Im heavily weighing the options. I don't want to live, to suffer, anymore. I've attempted in the past and i pussied out in the last moments. But this time, if i have to, i will. I can't live like this anymore. I'd probably get disowned if i called the child support hotline, and i go to a private school on an academic scholarship, so i'll have to move schools, which'd mean i'd lose my closest friends in real life.

Im pretty much failing every class, flunking every class, i don't do work anymore, im constantly in pain. My head thumps everyday with migraines and i cant focus, i can only stay sane from my dogs and music. Im in love with videogames, but my pc died last september so i havent been able to play and it made me really sad. 

I just want some incentive to live, to keep going, but i cant see anything but my future going dim. I'm in school typing this out. Im hoping by some insane luck that i can make it through this. I promised myself that depending how my year started out, i'd contemplate suicide. I decided that i would do it in feb but didnt, so i want to do it today. Idk how i'll make it through this. Please, someone, help me.",4
i was in a relationship where my gf had severe anxiety and depression. i tried to help her but she had to go to the hospital because of it. once she came back i went into a depression. i think i might've picked it up off of her but i don't know. she didn't tell me she was stressed or how she was feeling and she broke up with me while i had no idea what the fuck was going on. she had feelings for someone else for the last week we were together. she doesn't want to talk to me right now and says she wants a break from me when she claims that i was hardly the cause for her stress. if i'm hardly the cause then why am i the only thing being shut out of her life? i still want to try to repair my relationship with her but i don't know what to do at this point. reddit please give me advice. i'm not doing well mentally or physically right now and i need it.,4
"I'm going through... well alot. Over the past few months. I dont even know where to begin.

"There's so much fucking pressure on me and I hate it, I don't want to be seen as ""the smart kid""because I'm not, college is kicking my ass. I just got lucky and cheated through highschool. I don't want all of this pressure, it is killing me",2
"I can't bear to fucking do it. But there's no choice. She has a carcinoma, and the vet told us that chemotherapy is also an option, but there is no certainty that she will be cured, so this is our only option. 

I've never felt so empty and overwhelmed with anxiety at the same time. I can't even bring myself to see her. It breaks me inside. 

I just want her to have peace, but I don't want to let her go. It's horrible to see how a such a being with a noble heart has to endure this shit. I'm gonna miss my big girl so much.

I was almost self harm free for a month, but of course I fucked that up and cut again. I hate myself so fucking much, and I hate myself more for even trying to get help and support from anyone. People have told me to my face to kill myself, yet I don't blame them at all. I'm just a fucking selfish asshole even though I don't even think of myself as human. Every single minor inconvenience makes me want to slit my wrists, which of course, only makes me feel absolutely fucking terrible because there are so many people that have it worse off than me.

"In 2014, I first entered university and encountered a lot of changes: new people, new environment, new classes, and so on.

At the time, I had a lot of acne, which prevented me from meeting people. Furthermore, I had an identity crisis and started asking fundamental questions of life such as: ""who am I? why am I here? where do I go?"", and constantly thought about life and death. I wanted to harm myself and other people because I was in such a lonely, miserable spot when everyone else looked so happy. This lasted a few months. 

In between, I picked up lifting weights, practiced meditation, and my acne cleared up. 

Fast forward 5 years, I am completely happy. I have good friends, a good relationship with my family, and I have a stable career. Since my environment improved, my negative thoughts subsided. But I know that depressions don't go away with time, and that's what I'm worried about.

My best friend does not like me that much.

I have so much wrong with me physically and mentally, if society wasnt so accomodating to idiots like myself i'd be dead. I should be dead.

My boss thinks i'm racist because i'm terrible at communicating something.

Loud noises make me panic, i dont trust anyone, i like to deprive myself of sleep.. if i was anywhere else i'd be dying slowly. Or maybe someone would of come along and put me out of my misery. 

But i dont feel complete without the misery, i dont like to inflict it on others unlike people i know, i just dont feel like myself unless i'm depressed and suffering. I feel greedy if i'm not unhappy.

I listen to everyone, but no one listens to me. When they do, i over do it because i guess i'm just selfish and thats all they see of me. So when i ever open up again, they roll their eyes and leave.

He's in a bad situation and I can't fix any of it. He's says he's ready to go. I know my feelings just put more stress on him, so I try to avoid talking about them as much as I'd like to. We're long distance so I can't even touch him. He's been pushing me away for awhile now and it hurts so much. 

I'm also struggling morally with allowing him to go through with it. 

I won't have anyone to lean on because you can't talk to people about allowing someone to suicide. I think my one friend who knows about the situation will think I'm a bad person for not getting the authorities involved.

-4 separate deadlines looming, haven't even started reading for 3 of them

-everyone is better than me

-i do not feel like i deserve to be at the uni i am at because i do not feel clever enough or that i fit in and feel like no one cares about me

-my classmate/friend is 700x better than me at everything... She is genuinely good at everything and she loves to ""unknowingly"" rub it in my face and make dehumanising comments if i ever even allude to struggling with anything by the slightest amount... Like if i ever even start to ask her for help or talk about how i dont understand a lecture before i even get a sentence out she cuts me off with ""what? Noooooooo dont be so sILLY, thats obvious!"" or goes on about how easy she finds it or how ""i dont need to go to revision because i know everything and [talking about exam we did earlier in the term which she hasn't looked at her grades for yet] i would know if i got anything wrong and i know i didnt because i know what i was doing"" blah blah blah ok I get it u know everything and are god sent

-If i even suggest i might not be all that ok upstairs she tells me im fine and that i dont need to worry and literally just shuts me down and then immediately complains when i dont talk to her when we walk to lectures together

-my friend is fucking the most self absorbed person you know and she doesnt even realise and to make it worse we are from polar opposite social classes (i.e she is rich, privately educated, lived extremely sheltered and ungrateful life where ahe gets whatever she wants whenever) so she always makes comments about things like if i mention student debt she LITERALLY went ""well your parents pay for university so dont worry""... And i had to go ""no they cannot afford to do that"" and then proceed to tell her, yes, i have had a job since i was 14 and no it wasnt because i wanted experience it was so i could afford the luxury of university and then explain what a bursary was and she kept making ignorant remarks like ""wha- why would you need that"" ""it doesn't cost thAT much"" and just... She is quite dehumanising and makes me feel like utter worthless shit. Its annoying because she doesnt realise how lucky she is and how lucky she is to of had to many opportunities handed to her and all the connections she has to good companies and high paying jobs just because of who her parents are... Like... All im saying is i wish she would stop being so blind to the world and actually learn that there are other people that exist that haven't lived the same life as her and i wish she would be respectful to people and not so fucking oblivious to the world!

-i miss home

-i am burnt out and need a break but i do not and will not ever get one because as soon as term is over, i need to revise. Then term starts and i learn. Then term ends and i revise and study and work and revise. No break ever.

-anxiety through the roof about everything

-i miss home

-other stuff like memories about things i forgot ever happened but i cant remember all the details or i remember everything over and over again and im not sure why they make me feel so horrible or nervous because theyre not necessarily bad events im just thinking about memories or events from when I was younger or not even from that long ago but i wish i wouldnt remember anything because it seems to be bothering me

-comparing myself to my sister, my sister being better than me, im expected to do really really well at uni ""for your sister"" (according to my mother since my sister is taking a year out of uni)... So MY degree isnt about me anymore its about doing it for my fucking sister who has basically stolen everything from me and now since she i taking a year out all the attention is on her, which is fine but now eveyone assumes she is the only one allowed to suffer and i am doing fantastic because i haven't dropped out or taken a year out or anything so apparently that means im fucking fantastic and going to get a 1st in my exams (""for"" my sister... Because i dont matter)... And i also cant go to my parents, not that i ever would have before, because all attention is on my sister and i am not allowed to let them down i have to do well for my sister

-genral annoyed about everything

-nothing is fair but im not allowed to say that because ""LiFeS nOt fAiR"" so i just have ro suck it up and pretend that im fantastic and love that everything is against me",2
"I (20 m) may or may not have depression and if I do it's very mild, however that being said I feel this pain because I messed up the future I had with the girl I seriously would've hand crafted. I was madly in love with her but long distance made it not work in the end, I don't have a problem moving on, but what's hurts more than the break up did is finding out within a couple of months she's met another guy, flew to him, and is planning on moving in with him. This could've so easily been me and her it's painful. When we were together in person I can easily say that was the happiest 2 weeks of my life. Now I get it most people will think â€œjust find someone elseâ€ but like some others I assume I am extremely picky. And then people will be like â€œjust don't be as pickyâ€ and my response is I will never be as happy with someone if I settle for less. 

I've never been this unhappy with living, what are good tips for turning this around and being happy again? There's really only one thing I'm looking for in my life right now and that's someone to connect to.",4

"Is it just the depression ? I just feel like like there's isn't enough good in my life to warrant living . Not to worry suicide is essentially outside my moral code .

"Everyone is constantly interrupting me and talking over me. Whenever I try talking about my problems no one seems to care and just counteracts it by saying how they have it harder. I mean, I guess they do but I wish I could just talk to someone at school without them saying how they have like so much more work and they got two hours of sleep last night. That's why I hate being nice and supportive sometimes. I listen to other people, I help other people and I feel like it almost never gets returned. I'm there for other people but it feels like no one is there for me. 
And it's not only at school. At home, I'm the youngest and it feels like they just ignore what I say, and don't listen to anything I have to say. They are so proud of my sister, and I am too, but they don't care as much about my accomplishments and awards. Maybe it's because they aren't as impressive as hers?",1

"I just got back from a week long stay on the big island of Hawaii. I had some of the coolest experiences from seeing a shark while snorkeling, to being right next to feeding manta rays. It was an amazing trip and I loved it so much. 

But the problem I have is that whenever I have gone on vacations, even when I was young, I would cry and be horribly depressed for the next few days to a week or two. I hate going on vacations because I know that I'm going to feel like shit after. Nothing feels right when I come home and I just want to be spending â€œone more dayâ€ out away from real life. I hate it because I know that I will have to go back to work and that I won't get another vacation like this for a very long time. I hate that I can't explain how I'm feeling to my wife because she's lucky enough not to have to experience depression except from a third person perspective. 

I so badly want to still be out on Hawaii, or anywhere I've gone on vacation to, because out there, I don't have to care about work; I don't have to care about school, bills, or family drama. I can just be. I don't want to have to go back to work and school on Monday, but I know I have to or else things will be worse in the long run. I hate that I'm feeling like I shouldn't have gone to Hawaii in the first place. 

I loved spending all that time with my wife and enjoying that week together. I loved seeing things that I never have before and being somewhere that I haven't been. I loved having that time to do whatever I wanted and not feeling badly that I didn't do anything I didn't want to. I loved the anticipation and excitement leading up to the day we left. 

I think that's from where a lot of my depression stems: building up the anticipation, then it's here and it's so great, but then it's gone sooner than it arrived, and you go back to anticipating nothing. 

I feel like life is mostly boring, dull, and no one really wants to admit that, so when you get a few days to enjoy yourself, after, it feels like the nothingness deepens and you sink further into it. 

I don't know if this made any sense or if anyone is going to read this, but I really just want to stop crying and go to bed.",5
"Give me one good reason I should not kill myself right now. The whole world is going to shit and no one can change that. The only people that could help refuse to. The world will never be a good place, it will always be on the brink. Everyone always says to just look on the bright side, but what is the point? For every good thing you could say, I could name off 3 bad things. Why shouldn't I just end it right now and save myself the trouble. Everyone dies eventually, there is no point in being afraid of the inevitable. I house I can't afford will be underwater anyways, if were not all dead by the time I need one. Everyone always says that I shouldn't kill myself because people would be sad. Welp, I'm not a good person. I'm selfish, rude, hopeless, and just annoying in general. As is everyone. To me there is no point in prolonging the inevitable. So please if you have a good actual answer that is not just â€œsome people would be inconveniencedâ€ than please tell me.",5

"What's it like when you come out of a depressive episode? I know it's not sudden for most.

I just want to know because although I haven't been depressed my whole life, I have been in a very deep depressive episode the past year and a half and my memory is appalling. I've genuinely totally forgotten most of my life, especially how I felt during previous periods of time. (This memory loss is related to dissociation and prolonged trauma as well as low serotonin)

My friend said that she's come out of her depression and that she feels different. She feels ambitious and the dog has gone. Things feel less difficult. It's given me so much hope and I want to hear your success stories.

Because I know that it's common to feel like it'll never end. But I need to know it will. I'm already so much better thanks to antidepressants but I still struggle a lot.",3
"This is my first ever post on reddit. A friend of mine said I should post here and I've been finding every excuse not to but I am afraid that I have nothing left so why not? Here goes....I've literally given everything I have to my marriage and I'm not getting anything in return. We have 4 amazing children together and they are everything to me but often times I feel like it's only a matter of time before they realize I'm not worth their time and they too move on from me. I found out my wife was cheating on me and for some reason I still wanted to work things out with her. Well fast forward 4 months later and things are happening with another guy. Every confrontation about it is basically flipped and I'm made to feel like this is all my fault. I've never cheated on her and I've never thought about it a single time. I'm feeling so low that I don't want to be here anymore. I feel like a stranger in my own home. People tell me to think of my children but what good is that when you truly believe they will be better off without you? I'm not worth trying to make a marriage work so why would I be worth it to them? They didn't even choose me. I attempted suicide before, just before Christmas. My sister-in-law found me and called 911 and I ended up in a hospital for a week. I promised I would never let that happen again but I just can't help the thoughts coming back. I don't see a way out and I have nothing left to give.",4

"Because I am so tired of this shit. I've tried to sit them down and explains syuff to them. It didn't work. Never works. 

They don't outright say that they're punishing me because I'm depressed, but the things I do or don't do because I'm depressed get punished. I have bad grades, I'm failing in almost everything. I'm trying but with depression is really hard. You know what I get for trying? My phone and videogames taken away. I can't fall asleep at night because of anxiety. You know what I get for having nightly panic attacks? Yelled at for ""staying up all night."" You know what I get for having trouble keeping my room clean? Grounded. 

Tommorow I'm losing my phone because my grades are bad. Ignore the fact that I'm trying, yeah let's only care about a damn letter of the alphabet because THAT makes more sense than a flippin living person! t(-_- )t

I don't even like my phone that much. I'm not one of those people who are super addicted or nothing. But my phone is a coping mechanism. Without being able to vent or watch some relaxing video to calm me down I'm probably just gonna end up cutting myself.

What should I do? Or should I just suck it up and deal with their butts for the next few years? Which, I don't know if I could survive the latter.",5

I have to sleep twenty feet away from that, and I am told to man up just deal with it. Well I'm fucking tired of pretending. I've been molested and my father left me, not once but twice. How can be happy with that? What pisses me off is that sense he left me and won't awnser my calls I'll never get to see my little sisters. Two of them that I'll never get too meet. But you know I'm a good boy, I just need to smile through the pain and just be happy. Right? That's what my family says to do, that's what society says to do.

"I've been like that, having suicidal thoughts, since i was 13. I have exams in about 2 months, which right now is the main couse of my stress. My parents are also about to divorce in propably a year (knowing how long this sort of stuff takes). I live with my mom, who is alwayes really stressed about and in a hurry. Recently i have also been having a heart ache, which the doctor said is caused by stress and uneasiness. 
My mom knows there's something wrong with me and suggested a therapist to help me deal with my stress, but i dont think she really understands why im acting this way.

"I just made a journal entry and I thought I could share it to see if it helps anyone going through grief stages. 

There's something that happens to a person when a piece of your soul passes away. You realize that you're in denial all this time. That something you never thought you would want becomes something you realized you pushed away into the ignorant side of your mind so you wouldn't think about it. So yes, a part of my soul is gone. And I've been trying to numb that pain that is beyond any kind of description. I feel like I had something precious that was ripped out of my hands and lit on fire to burn. Something that was alive and part of me burned and I could feel that slow, painful burn. Like watching someone you love get tortured by some unknown entity. This results in the stages of grief.... there's denial. Which I already had since I was a child. I grew up in ignorant bliss. Not wanting to acknowledge what I knew was true. 
The there was anger. This nasty creature that you create to get back at whatever hurt you. And it will literally drive you mad. Crazy, trying to show others how much someone hurt you. Trying to find something called â€œclosureâ€ ( which by the way is the only fairytale or myth that you will ever hear. Closure is the only thing in the world that is impossible). Now you're stuck in this miserable monster. You wonder how you'll escape alive and some never do. I'm sorry for the ones who were the center of my anger and unclearity. You did not deserve what I gave you from my period of grief.
Then you bargain. For the sake of whatever sanity you may have left. You bargain for hope, freedom, and whatever else that you have. It's not a lot. But regardless you bargain just the same. You try to find people who will help and love you unconditionally. Then you realize that they can't enable the grief anymore than you can. You're left alone again. Wondering who the hell you have become because it just isn't you anymore. You've become this sad and hopeless mess of a person. The people you love love you so much they can't take your struggling any more that you can. That's when your soul dies a little more.
Then there is depression. That's there through y'all of the stages. That feeling of NO motivation. No life. It's an empty void but filled with all the feeling mentioned prior. Depression makes you remember your not the only one. You are made of many sad and hurting people who just want some sort of clarity. They just question every day â€œ why? What can I do? Why am I feeling these things.â€ This makes you wonder if your feelings are even ok to feel. 
Supposedly, there is acceptance.... I have not gotten there yet. Most with depression haven't. Good luck to all of us. This is that bridge that we have not crossed and some (myself) are very afraid to cross it. It means that we will be ok. And sometimes that's really scary because we don't always know how to feel ok anymore. We have the beautiful loved ones that have been there no matter what. They want our success and happiness. A deep part of our soul wants that too.... the part that is still alive. We forget that part don't we? My beautiful friends. There is a soul in our bodies. One that has not been ripped away. One that cannot be taken from an ugly thing such as grief. Every day that we are here. Together. Let's reach out to the part of our soul that has survived. And let us remember that we are more than our grief and suffering.

Just expressing feelings and open to input.",5
"I feel like there are only three things that you absolutely cannot be, dumb, ugly, and useless. I've gotten through life fairly well being able to somewhat accept the dumb and ugly part, I tried to blame it on other factors for a while but they're just an integral part of who I am. What I can't get passed is being useless and having no skill whatsoever. I fall into all three categories and wish that I had just given up on life sooner.",1

I left a domestic violent relationship and they're days that haunt me of what happened and it shuts me down even more. I sit alone in my car at lunch because no one wants to be around me. I hate myself. Is there something wrong with me? Am I a bad person? Sometimes I wonder why keep up fighting when no one gives a fuck about you. You're destined to be nothing and no one. I have a cell phone and social media but why? No one msgs me, texts me, or calls me. No one would know if I was gone because no one gives a shit about me.",1
"For context, I'm 19, in my first year of college, and for one month - since I failed one of my exams - I lost everything I thought I had. All my friends, my crush, and for a week now, my Dad, who just wants to be upset at me forever for not helping him to the end with carrying some construction material.

For one month, I've entered a downward spiral, amplified by events such as the rejection mentioned earlier, or not being able to give the license exam two days ago because of some stupid policemen who told me that I â€œdidn't pay the license taxâ€ correctly. And not being able to make up with my Dad, who just hates me.

The final straw came an hour ago, when I got laughed at when I entered the classroom. Just because I happened to enter at the same time as some other older students who didn't belong there.
When I left the college, no one noticed.

It is probably a matter of weeks or even days before I take my life. Nothing is worth it. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing can save me now. Nothing. And what's more, no one (apart from probably my mother and sister) won't miss me. But let's be serious, they'll live without me. And also, I'm sure no one will notice this post, in the heap of posts of people with more serious life issues. 

This is really what makes me a failure: not being able to live happily in a life which would seem ok to most people here.

I haven't had an official doctor, just rotating nurse practitioners from clinics.

When I came out to my grandparents, my grandma said it ran on my mom's side of the family. Her words were that there â€œwas another [transgender], but he's dead nowâ€. I don't know who that is. But he's dead. And I keep feeling called to be. I get why so many trans activists kill themselves.

Everyone thinks I'm lazy, but I can feel the physical block. My therapist says it's almost definitely related to my cPTSD. But I don't know what to do. She doesn't know either.

Maybe I'm whining. I'm first-generation in my country. My mom moved here from a third world country with practically nothing. But I do feel like my body was not meant for this.

"Long story short.. I've been in and out of college, failing out two different times taking breaks from classes once or twice. I've had on and off addiction problems with alcohol during this time.. basically I've been trying to get a bachelor's degree for 7 years. The last 4 years of college has caused me soo much stress. My parents are wealthy and not to say they are at fault in any way for my failire but they have sort of enabled me financially to keep trying to get a degree. Ive wasted probly around $100,000 dollars on failed/withdrawn classes. My sister deeply resents me for this. I have an insane amount of guilt for this too even though my parents say they would pay anything and help me in any way they can for me to graduate. 

So after all that, i made it to my final semester b4 graduation. Im only taking 2 classes but i might fail 1 of them and that would result in my 3rd and final academic dismissal, meaning i wount get a degree cause of a flunk in my final semester. I just dont understand why i cant just sit here and do my homework and actually care. My problem is i dont give a crap about anything unless i have an innate desire or interest in it. Like my motivation is just 0 in anything thats academic i dont understand why!

So after all this.. even if i do pass and graduate i feel like im so broken, endured so much stress by the age of 26 that i feel like just a vegetable now. i cant fathom myself using my business degree to get a ""real job"" i dont know if ill ever be able to get over the idea that i spent over 250,000 dollars on a degree and i have no desiree to work a normal job because i feel like my brain is this empty void that only seeks pleasure and has no purpose or drive. On the surface, im a happy bubbly person. Im outgoing and very sociable. I feel deep down i really have alot of potential but im soooo lost and so easily overwhelmed by everything. I feel the slightest bit of resistance and i just shut down mentally and seek pleasure in the form of leisure activity or alcohol. 

Idk where im even going with this.. sorta just letting it all out i guess because i have nobody to talk too. If you read this far im sorry for all the grammatical errors i just typed it all out and didnt re read it once. 

Have a nice day",5
"So I went through a lot throughout my life and none of it is really my fault (except one that I exist) but brain keeps on attacking me for all bad things for example if my mom refused to pay my tution fee and I get kicked out my brain imposes the fault on me or if i am sick and i am sick because my selfish parents hide my medical records my brain blame me for my sickness as well , I couldn't get into college again parents bam brain attack me again. If people bully me my brain again attack me 

tl;dr my brain loves attacking me with no sense.

So how do I stop blaming myself for everything I didn't done?",4
"I keep getting close and then I fuck up because I'm not some person who gets to get through things and gets to be successful. I'm me.

I'm a fuck up and I'm a failure. All the people in my life are temporary because eventually they hate me as much as I hate myself.

I'd rather die than have to be me anymore.",5
"I'm 16 years old kiddo and diagnosed with deep depression along with SAD (Social Anxiety Disorder).

It's so hard to talk with people or even go out but today i made my first move and went to school where i haven't gone for almost 2 years. Now i'm making my way up to get benzodiazepams for *SAD*
I hope everything goes well and i can go out with friends again cause i barely remember my last time i went out with friends :( my relatives think i'm just lazy but they dont understand how hard it is for me to talk to people or even go out, i get like mini panic attack when i come contact with stranger and it feels awful. Oh mann im just so tired of this shyt",3
"I literally feel like I'm just waiting to die. I don't see any hope for myself or the future. I've given up on the basic things that most people would say makes life worth living like meaningful relationships, stability, hobbies, and quite frankly, just living. Nothing has any meaning for me any more. I'm just on repeat until the day comes when my body decides it's done trying to keep itself alive. I'm only living so other people don't feel bad about me when I'm gone. What a shitty way to spend the rest of my existence",5
"Has someone here survived an attempt or knows someone who did?
I'd like to know how life looks like when you survive. How it's gonna impact social life (got no friends and family so probably not too much). How it impacts work and school (trying to graduate 2nd time. Dropped out cause of massive depressive episode and cause I got homeless). And just other things like are you put in therapy or even hospitalized and for how long.

I'm in a situation where I just wish to die. But I can't kill myself cause I'm worried about what might happen if it fails or I somehow survive. Like how my life that's already the worst could get even worse then.",5
Everyone thinks im a joke,1
"People are unrelatable and hindering to me at this point. I feel as if every time someone approaches me, or walks into my space, I can predict what they are going to say to me. This annoys me further.

Ive been fired from the last 5 jobs, all for reasons of using marijuana to calm myself from my co workers, or outright having a verbal confrontation which results in me getting fired. I used to like being around people, but as i reach the age of 25 i feel like i've been struggling for an eternity.

Im truly tired of this fucking 9-5 society everyone seems to be able to spend 40 years in and come out accomplished. It seems no matter how many counsellors i appoint myself with, or how many doctors appointments im making nobody is helping me and i feel im reaching my breaking point. I know i cant live without society, but this cant continue.

Ive tried steps to help myself, counselling, therapy, doctors appointments; all leads back to the same bullshit place im in now, stuck in society. 

Ive recently acquired my second dui, have a breathalyzer in my vehicle and spend most days sitting at home thinking about how much i hate interacting with people.

The women my age ive dated and been around dont want to hear any of this. Men arent supposed to complain or whine. Im supposed to shut up, apply for another job, and continue to â€œrun at it like a bullâ€. 

I can't relate this to anyone in my life, so im here asking if anyone feels the way I do, and how youve surpassed this moment in your life without turning to hard drugs.",1
"I'm 22 years old. And unlike most of the people here, I truly deserve to kill myself.

I've been verbally and physically abusive to everyone around me since I could talk. 

So far as humans go. I bullied kids when I was a kid. Lots of kids. I was never nice to anyone. I was mean to my parents. I hit. I beat up one of my friends. As an adult, I've been physically and verbally abusive to my mom. I've left her with black eyes. And my stepdad. I've told them both to kill themselves a million times. I've said some truly awful things. Not just to them. I lost a friend after I verbally biasd her, too. And I've treated my best friend horribly.

Worse than that, the animals. Both of the first cats I ever had ran away, so I must have done something to them. The third, I chased her around and sprayed her with water and hit her. For years. She was traumatized. She hated me. She'd always scratch me up and I deserved it. The fifth cat ran away, I don't know what I did. The sixth cat I don't remember if I was mean or nice but I gave her to some old ladies because we had to move. I hope they loved her. My seventh cat is my current cat. I got her right before I turned twelve. I used to put a laundry basket over her and shake it while she screamed. She was just a little kitten. I stopped doing that at some point because my mom talked to me. But I hit her. Sometimes multiple times. This cat isn't traumatized mostly. She cuddles me every fucking night that I let her. But...

Then there's my dogs. I beat the shit out of my older dog, multiple times when I was an older teen. I beat him with shoes because he chewed them. He was just sad I had to go to school and I beat him. My younger dog I beat the shit out of once (maybe, technically, twice? same day in a short time period), ever. 1,264 days ago. I was so gutted about how badly I hurt him-- he was bruised under his fur and upset for days-- I swore never to beat any animal ever again, and I haven't. But I still hit them. I'm ""extremely abusive"". That's how my grandma describes me. My fucking grandma. (The dogs aren't traumatized at all anymore, but...)

I also ripped off a lizard's tail...and killed a lizard...but those were accidents. 

On top of all that, it's quite possible I'm a pedophile. When I was 14, I chased an 11 year old girl around trying to kiss her. (I succeeded. This happened 2x.) And when I was 19, I read 2 fanfiction about a sexual relationship between a 16 year old and a 12 year old. And I had dreams for years about rape? Of children? I mean, I also have OCD and it could just be that. But one day I abruptly decided that That Wasn't Going To Happen Anymore, and now it happens much less. It's unpleasant. 

I don't want to be like this. I don't want to be abusive to anyone. I was never biasd. I recently started therapy (again). I'm on medication (Paxil). I think about the bias all the time. It's probably 80% of my thoughts. I am trying to not do these things. To never be verbally or physically abusive again. I love my family and my pets and they have never deserved this. But I will never be able to undo the things that I have done. Even if I try to make amends. Even if I'm forgiven, which I am. I am a bad person, and thanks to what I've done, I will always be.

I deserve every ounce of guilt I've felt these past 1,264 days that I've known I've abusive. These past years where I didn't try to change until now. I deserve to feel this way every miserable day for the rest of my life. I deserve to kill myself.",4
"I feel tired. Nothing brings me a joy. I lost all my fucking hobbies. I started smoking a lot. I have alcoholic dad, he often lies, also he borrowing my money, but never give them me back. Luckily, my mom isn't such an alcoholic, but she also drinks a lot. I remember, when i was a child, my parents often dont have money to buy tge food, so i used to visit my grandma, and take some food from her, to feed me and my younger brothers. i remember, once my dad came back home, so drunk, that he beated my mother,and btoke a glass door. There were a fucktone of blood.It was sticky and smelled horrible. When i was 13 i was raped by my drunk dad. Nobody knows about it. Also 2 months ago,i found a gf, but she broke with the me up. Also she was amphetamine addicted. She was mentally unstable. She had a lot of overdose. Honestly I miss her. I feel like i don't have future. I was born because condom ripped, and anti pregnant tablets wasn't working. I feel useless. I live in a small town in Western Ukraine. My town is a fucking shithole of the Europe. In 1 year i will be graduating, but i don't know where I want to study.",4
"I'm so sick of this. I have a big nose, big forehead, big everything and it's so hard to deal with. People have told me they didnt date me because I'm ugly. People have even told me I'm too ugly to go after. Don't get me wrong, I've been in my fair share of relationships, but I've been rejected so many times just for being ugly and I'm sick of it. 

I am soon to leave home for college and before that I want to get a nose job to make me more confident before I leave, but none of the 758394858 retail jobs I've applied to got back to me. It's like the world wants me to be this way.

I'm not believing that looks don't matter bs. I just want to look good, and that's it. I'm suicidal because of it. I'm sick of living when I can't look good.",1
"Why be sad about it. Why prolong something inevitable. 

I've self harmed since middle school and I've wished for death that long too. I've been through treatments I can't stick with and people I can't stick with. I somehow appear confident on the outside but I just feel worthless. A black hole that doesn't deserve the light from anyone else. I'd like to think i don't believe in destiny but I never feel so sure about anything besides this. There's nothing else I truly know. 


It'd be cool to at least go out as one of those tortured artist types but I can't even make myself do art anymore. 


Studied hard for my stats exam tomorrow so killing myself won't happen tonight. I don't know how to. I don't think I can. But I can buy a ticket somewhere. Maybe I'll just go somewhere far, with nothing and hope for the worse. 

Or maybe a nice pimp will find me who just makes my life simple. I can just stay coked up and be someone's sex doll. I don't want to think anymore I fucking hate my mind",5
"It is midnight and I cannot sleep again. I cannot remember the last time I slept through the night. I sleep in tiny spurts throughout the day but can never stay down for long. I often have nightmares even when I do stay sleeping for some time.

The other night, for example, I woke up screaming. I had been dreaming that I was eating a bowl of cereal and looked down and my spoon was covered in spiders. I actually like spiders so I am not sure why it scared me so bad. My husband reached over and held my hand and shushed me until I calmed down. It seems like he is too good to me always. I feel like I don't deserve it.

Tonight I looked outside the window at the world as I often do throughout the day. I thought to myself: the people that I have met, all of them, all of the people I have come across... does anyone of them ever think of me? Ever? Do they ever wonder how I am? Even just for a second? If they did, I wish I knew, because I feel like a shadow living life alone inside my house day after day. 

At the same time I feel that I am unworthy of friendship, community, love. Today at therapy my therapist asked me my goals. I said... to have a friend and to be a part of a small community that truly cared for me. But I have never felt or experienced that. I only know what friendships and loving communities are like from observing others. I truly pity anyone who would want to befriend me, because I think I would make the worst friend.",5
"Hello everyone, just to preface my doctor has diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, and ocd. Recently I have been filled with self hatred. I am 5'7â€ and weigh 140 pounds. I am convinced I am fat even though this is a very average body weight. When I look in the mirror I think how ugly I am. People tell me I am attractive but I do not believe them.

I'm have traveled abroad three different times...yet when others tell me about their travels I feel inadequate. My dreams and goals feel absolutely impossible.

I also constantly google mental illness and symptoms because I am convinced something is majorly wrong with me...even though three doctors have told me I am â€œnormalâ€. I take multiple mental health quizzes everyday to see if I have lost my mind. I am constantly asking my coworkers at work what they think about me.

"depression is writing sick poetry on skin and publishing it with scars, cutting on ankles, not wrists because you're scared you'll get in trouble but you so desperately need to be seen, and never are.

TW: drug use

September 9th Of 2018 was the worst day of my life, on that day my father had passed away unexpectedly from a blood clot in his lung that the doctors knew about but never put him on medication for. That day, my entire life had changed and since then I haven't been able to recover. While yes I was depressed much before this and had been struggling with suicidal thoughts and tendencies since I was 8, my father death had made it all so much worse. I had started to get on anti-depressants, get counseling, and come out to my mother as trans not long after this because she had discovered I was trans. None of these treatments helped much until late November after I had attempted suicide and realized how cared for I was by family that had visited me in the hospital, then I really started to work hard for them to get better and to make sure I could get to the day when I could start hormone replacement therapy in about a year. Not long after that incident I traveled to New Mexico to visit family and my mom fell in love with a hole here and felt the need to reconnect with the family that lived there so she had decided to buy a home here and make my family move, which I can't fully blame her for wanting to get out of the state we lived in (ny), it reminded her too much of my dad. When I first heard this news I was depressed about it but slowly become more accepting as I got much happier and healthier. I got to a point where I no longer felt the need for medication and cut back on therapy before moving to New Mexico, but those months of hard work all crashed when I got here. When I moved I had honestly lost everything I had known and have been stuck with a family of alcoholics who always start stupid drama over small things. I feel as if I can't even do anything without someone starting shit about something I've done when I'm around them. But anyways soon enough I start school, I'm fairly excited about it but quickly that excitement dies out and is replaced with absolute misery. The school I currently go to refuses to let me use the mens bathroom and makes me use the women's one because of my biological sex, keeps all of my accounts and name on the attendance as my birth name despite the fact I don't identify with it, and dress coded me for piercings and dyed hair which they had never mentioned would be a problem when I went to register for the school not even a week before the school year started. So on my first day I get dress coded for things I was never warned about and told I had signed a paper that states I fully read through the dress code and agreed to comply with it (which I had actually gotten two weeks later during school hours). Bullshit, right? Well it gets worse. The only kid willing to talk to me was a drug addict who had done cocaine in front of me and offered me some, while high he almost choked himself to death and chucked a desk at the girls in front of us which was quite fucking terrifying. Almost a month after this event the same kid breaks my pencil sharpener and takes the blade part out of it, leaving the class shortly after to go to the bathroom. Of course I tell the teacher and she gets the counselor to get him, and he gets sent to a mental hospital for a week or so and transfers schools. So while yes, he may have been an absolute crackhead he was still the only friend I had so I was very bummed out and felt alone. Months pass and I feel more and more depressed as days go by, I start contemplating suicide once again and try to get my mom to get me a therapist (which she still hasn't done). And of course on top of all of this kids at school find out I'm transgender and I've been getting dead named, picked on, and asked extremely personal questions since then. Because of this discovery made by my classmates I've started to also gotten rape threats and death threats in which I feel there's no point in reporting since the school cannot even comply by the laws and let me use the bathroom I feel comfortable in. Well I have started to make friends I still feel all alone and hopeless for things to get any better for my life, I've been trying so hard to get my life back into shape and actually gave loving here my best shot but I've failed myself and been failed by so many others, I see no point in continuing on since things keep getting worse and I'm not sure if I can hold on that much longer. The only reason I'm still here is because I know there's people that care and I don't want to put them through the same pain I went through when I lost my dad.",4
"I've suffered from depression my whole life, and I've just had enough. I have no friends, I have some family but they are very selfish. I have my mum and know she cares but I just feel like I'm a burdon to her and I know for a fact she'd be happier without my bullshit. I've got no one to talk to and honestly I've just had enough. I got into a bit of a car accident today and burst my tyre and I just don't have the energy to sort it. I just don't have the energy to keep on fighting. I've been talking to a few people online and that's helped but none of them are around to talk at the moment. I was talking to someone I really liked and they've decided to stop talking to me. I'm not sure why and I just have no one. I want to end... I want to end it now but I'm to much of a fucking pussy. I haven't been this close to ending it in a while though... I don't know what to expect from this, it just helps me clear my head I guess. I'm not really sure...",4
I could've sworn it was going to work due to the already stress that was on my heart but then again taking 100 mg worth of melatonin and beer probably wasn't going to kill me.

Is there a way for me to achieve this without having to see a psychologist? Sorry if I'm coming off a certain way. I'm just tired and need help.,5
"My question is can your body get depressed 
Without you even knowing it?
So the last few months I've seen some changes

But the thing is my mind feels okay and
Yes I've had suffered from depression many 
Times before, also a few other things. I see 
My doctor on a regular basis, but of late it's

I started thinking about the stuff that has been 
Going on with me for the last few months and I 
Remember that I had a major operation about 
7 months ago and that's when it all started and
Has gotten worse over time. The reason that
I'm asking here is because I don't want to

"I'm about to turn 20 soon, and lately I realized I don't even enjoy living.

Everyday I wake up, I don't even want to get out of bed I just want to lay there. When I do get out of bed I just hate doing anything. It doesn't matter what I'll be doing I just rather be dead all the time so I don't have to do anything? Maybe I'm lazy or something but I just hate doing stuff? I rather just be dead lol, so I can just be in peace.. 

I'm on antidepressants and they help but I still don't enjoy life, there's more why I don't enjoy life mostly cause I can't hold a job, or keep any friends or even talk to anyone. I just feel like a fucking ghost.

Been thinking about just ending up, but can't get enough courage to do it. Hopefully soon I just say fuck it and do it.",5
"I spoke to Lifeline (I'm from australia) and the person I spoke to was no help. Honestly, I wake up every morning regretting i did not die in my sleep the night before &amp; explained that to them, they decided to get into a debate about fucking religion of all things. 

I think at this point i just need someone to talk to, to be able to convince me why it's not a good idea to just slit my fucking throat or just jump off my 3rd floor balcony. Which I haven't done yet because I'm such a fucking coward.

Honestly i'm just so tired of life &amp; just want to end it all somehow without bothering my family.

I don't know what else to do. I seriously envy americans with their easy access to guns.

FYI, I'm on anti depressants already which are no fucking help what so ever. There's always the voice in the back of my head that tells me that once i do it, i'll be ok, I wont have to experience this shit anyway so why not just go ahead with it anyway.",5

I was going to wait for them to die but I don't think I can go on longer, there's a shotgun in my house and it seems like the best getaway option.

"i think i saw myself in the tub five times this whole day so far and its only 4pm. i care for the people around me very deeply and just the thought of them being devastated when i leave makes me even more depressed. i deal with all of this all by myself as everybody does. i feel bad because everyone eventually leaves me after realizing how difficult my situation is and how draining it can be to deal with it. i guess you can say i'm a big ass burden.

i'm not the best worker. i'm incredibly lazy. not because i choose to have fun, but because i don't feel good enough. my motivation to do anything is at a 0. another factor of why is i never know what i want to do. my upbringing wasn't great and i was always constantly thrown off course from the things i really wanted to do to cater to people who didn't care to see me happy. now i'm kinda doing my own shit without being asked, but it took me almost a year to learn how to think for myself. all thanks to my current partner though.

i'm starting to lose hope though. although i do have people i care for, i'm afraid of telling them how i feel beyond just â€œi'm depressed.â€ i know it makes the people around me really sad and sometimes suicidal themselves. so i stay quiet of the actual extent of how bad it can be. and because of my job, its hard to make friends. i can't even tell people about what i do. do you know how lonely it gets? having to bottle everything up but too afraid to tell people how its just eating me up slowly. i was doing well for a second with my job and then last week, i spent the whole time all burnt out, crying nonstop just by myself. i but because of my condition and how it's affecting me, i'm losing the one person who was able to get me to be productive and ignore my feelings. people are gonna comment and say â€œdon't ignore your feelings,â€ but i'm tired of having it impede my progress. and i know if they leave, i'll go back to how i was; not doing anything and just laying all curled up in a ball just waiting for death to come naturally.

now i feel like i should just end it to avoid all of this. i'm too much of a burden. i just want them to be happy.

I haven't wanted to drink alcohol so bad until today my past addictions or vices I should say are trying to creep inside me again the only reason why I think I'm strong enough to say no to it is because I have someone important to me keeping me very grounded.",1
"I've been doing the only thing I'm capable of to hold myself in place at this point, which is doing everything I can to ignore it all. My feelings, my life, the dread that comes every single fucking night.


I've been overeating to the point of getting sick. I've been spending days and more days barely taking care of myself, and just existing in my home, from which I barely leave for days on end.


I've been avoiding this conclusion forever, mostly because I'm so scared of it.


I don't think I want to exist. Every single night I try really hard to dream and fantasize about my deepest desires, in a desperate attempt to find a reason to pull myself up and keep going, but lately, I've been giving up so easily. I feel like nothing's is really worth it, and that includes myself. The thought of just ending it keeps coming over and over again, and it's getting harder and harder to fight back.


I'm scared. I feel cold and worthless. But what's worse is that I know tomorrow will be exactly the same.


I know there are people who love me and do so much for me, and I appreciate every single second they invest on me... But I've been really afraid of the idea that, even tho they try to, they can't really change things or help me in the ways that really matter in the end, like my mental condition, my traumas and the inescapable barrier that is my social class.


It's like I'm locked and always will be. And it doesn't seem very hard for me at the moment to believe that I'll end up dying by my own hands at some point.",3
"My parents were always coercive, and I was timid. It was too much for me to compete in a private high school, but my parents forced me to. I was forced to do it. And I entered medical school as my parents wanted. But I hate life that I regret every day by taking classes that I don't even want. But I don't have what I like and what I'm good at anymore. I want to get away from the life I've lived with as a puppet.",2
"That's what wrong. I know I'm in pretty deep depression, my life has changed so flipping much in the last 6 months. My happy-enough marriage has changed drastically, bringing us closer together but presenting other extremely difficult challenges. Announcing that my spouse is transgender, and so is my kid, is trying. I can only imagine what my wife is feeling about everything. 

I've lost nearly my entire family because of these changes, my wife's sister has disowned us, her parents are sort of supportive yet very transphobic. I hate that I have had to choose my wife over the family I grew up with, but I'd make that choice a million times over, no regrets. My mother has been nothing but cruel and evil. Everyone else is too close to her to reach out or keep in my circle. 

I don't know what the point of my post is. I'm just so down and don't want to vent to my wife right now.",4
"I'm at my 3rd job in my field out of grad. The first lasted 3 months before they told me it wasn't working out, the second lasted 7 months before they told me I was slipping, and this one just ended today with a phone call at a mere 2 months. I don't know if I can make myself go on. I don't know where else to go, my skills weren't good enough, and it was a specialized field. I was too quiet for something too client-oriented and it translated to having terrible communication skills that I can't get over. My peers are all going to hear about this, it's a small field and you tend to see everyone in the same industry at conferences, two of them worked at that first job and are heavy gossipers and they'll probably tell everyone there what happened and they'll feel that happy schadenfreude that I was a fucking failure, another piece of conversation fodder to laugh about. I have my other classmates on social media and they post about how great it is to be in that field, and some of them share the same interests as I do so I'll likely run into them again at fan-related events. They say that you shouldn't care about what other people think but easier said than done. I can't face them again and I can't face myself either. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that the options I've run through in my brain haven't been ideal, painless or with a high success rate as well as my cowardice so I guess I'll still be miserably alive until I find something suitable.",0
"I just feel like it's always something with me. I'm not doing anything big or exciting or impactful. I'm turning 25 in a few days, I'm married to a good man who loves me but we've struggled with communication and compatibility so we've been in therapy working on it. It's hard work. He's worth it, I love him, I'm in love with him, he's my best friend and partner, but I didn't think it would be this hard. Nobody talks about how hard being a couple is, it's all â€œit shouldn't be hard with the right personâ€ and that makes me feel like a failure. I feel like a failure in everything in my life. I can't keep a job, I'm currently unemployed and have no skills or qualifications in anything that is even remotely interesting to me. I hate not contributing financially and we're struggling. We can barely eat right now, it's humiliating. And it's my fault. I struggle with infertility, all we want is to start our family. I can't even do that. I never finished college and I have the debt to remind me every day. It's not going to get easier. I'm an adult. Nothing significant is going to change and make things easier. I'll never have the life I dream of, so what's the point?

I've overcome so much with anxiety and OCD. But it's still here and it really burns me out sometimes. I keep thinking about my future and how scary it is to age. I'm not afraid of dying, but I'm afraid of ceasing to exist if that makes sense. Who will be there at the end? Will I get sick? Will my husband? We could be in accidents, I could lose him to something traumatic, anything could happen. How do people live their whole lives? Becoming 40 feels so unrealistic. 

I just don't understand why I should keep doing this. I always have some kind of problem that's insignificant compared to the suffering of others. But here I am feeling sorry for myself on the internet. What is the point?",3

"Just over a week ago I left a really shitty situation with parents who have treated me pretty awfully for years and I am finally free - however, I'm homeless. I have been staying with friends and I spend some time in crisis accommodation provided by my psychologist after I finally opened up to her about everything they have been doing to me, and it's just been really hard.

I'm having trouble getting the legal documents I need to secure a stable living situation, in my country so much of that is reliant on parental confirmation even though I am a legal adult, and I met up with my mum today to try and talk things out with her but I got brutalised and put down and just made to feel really worthless all over again. She couldn't even not be cruel to me after meeting for just one day after not seeing eachother for awhile, so I have decided to go no contact.

I feel really helpless. I feel like the systems in place quite literally fuck you over if you have abusive families, needing their birth certificates to verify things. I feel like it has been made near impossible for me to live independently without them but I know I can never go back because they have put me through so much trauma and so many things I know to not be okay and they have no remorse, and I'm never going to put up with that ever again.

I really don't want to go on anymore, I feel so weak, I have been trying so hard to get everything in order for 10 days straight and it has amounted to nothing, and I really feel like I have no other choice,",4

"Does anyone have any suggestions for dealing with major depressive? I'm 20 years old and I've had depression since I was around 13. Everyday is a challenge and I'm at the point in which I feel like I'm losing myself. My closest friends live in different countries and I'm emotionally exhausted from holding onto all of my problems without talking about them. I feel like life would be easier to give up rather than fighting constantly with myself, but my family would be distraught over me hurting myself and they've done a lot for me so I'm resorting to telling people on the internet in the hope that someone knows how to deal with dark thoughts and the lack of emotions that I don't feel anymore. - Cereal",5
"Before I start I do got to say that I do not struggle with girls becoming interested in me since most of RateMe and many other places rate me at about 7.5-8 out of 10 for a male which is about average.
My main problem is keeping their interest in me.
A little background on me, I don't have many hobbies,dropped out of HS because of social anxiety and deppression,fathers dead,still living with mother, have no car nor license,and have no motivation whatsoever. So my life's a mess. 
So compared to most my age I'm lacking in pretty much everything, especially confidence. No friends really, so I'm mostly alone and feel like dying.
Thats why I came here, I need advice and need it bad because soon I'm afraid I'm going to hurt myself because this pain keeps breaking me down and down and I don't know where to turn. 
So any help would be appreciated. I'm just so close to ending it I just need someone to talk to right now.",5

A few months ago I was really having a hard time and was unsure if I would even make it this far. Medication has helped a lot but I just have little desire to exist for a full human lifespan. I know I am not the only one.",3

"Ever since my little sister was in the 3rd grade, she's been extremely unhappy and alone. She had strange rituals where she would obsess over locking the doors (pointing to the OCD she has today) and was the unspoken black sheep of the family. My older sister and I already were aware of her depression, and took her to a counselor (who didn't do much for her). We saw her cutting herself, but were too afraid to approach my parents as they are African. It wasn't until last year, my little sister of eight years old walked into the bedroom and saw my sister h\*nging herself on the back of the door. Luckily we got her in time, and she was admitted in the hospital. After a week or so, she came back beaming and happy. She has a therapist who she ""adores"", and is on medication. Everything was going smooth until she relapsed into her ways, and I caught her in another attempt. She's attempted. around 20 times now. My mom has had to quit her job to watch her. My sister claims she is doing fine, but just the other day I checked her phone and she was searching suicide methods. I have many after-school activities and no one can watch her around the clock. Someone please help me, I'm beyond the point of stressed and I have no determination. My grades have decreased this year because I spend so much time looking after her, yet, she ignores me and complains how people bother her. I'm scared to go to sleep, because sometimes she roams around looking for ways to hurt herself again. How am I supposed to help a teen who doesn't want to help themselves?! I'm in my junior year of high school, (my most important year) and I am completely hopeless. I love my sister so much, I can't even imagine not having her. If someone could offer me advice on how to help her I would really love it. Thank you.",4
"Similar story here, OP. In my case my dad spent my childhood promising to *help* me pursue a science career if I moved in with him, along with many other exorbitant promises. He then coaxed me into signing my life savings over to him under the guise of him teaching me money management skills. Afterwards his personality instantly changed like he had been replaced with a body snatcher:

He started holding my money hostage to control me. He forced me into a flat earth fundamentalist church. He started incessantly discouraging my scientific interests. I was forbidden from me from even being seen with a girl since it might lead others to think we were sexually active. He threatened to cut me off if I ever associated with members of so many demographics that I was functionally unable to have friends. He would scream at me and belittle and humiliate me for hours every day. His church was so strict that I had to give up most of my hobbies for being ""sinful"". He tried to damage my relationships with all of my other family members. He would constantly follow me around and would incessantly act out for attention so much that I struggled to even attempt my schoolwork or even my remaining hobbies. I was quickly so psychologically broken that I started failing my classes despite growing up an honors student. 

A few years later, I took on a second major hoping to raise my GPA and just barely squeak into grad school. Dad took this to somehow mean that I was ""on the verge of graduating with two PhDs"". He completely flipped from incessantly discouraging me to exerting 24/7 pressure to graduate with those two PhDs *immediately*. I explained over and over that I wasn't getting two PhDs, but he wouldn't accept it. Despite my protests he spread word far and wide about my ""two PhDs"" and I gained a reputation as some kind of miracle prodigy that I could never actually live up to. By this point Dad was in the final stages of terminal heart problems and was so relentless in his pressure that I started going along with it because even after all his years of lies and bias I didn't want to disappoint him on his death bed.

Years went by and things continued to get worse for me. I was overwhelmed with preemptive grief over dad's impending death every day. I went through a traumatic religious deconversion and lost my soul-sustaining (nonfundamentalist) faith in God. I started experiencing severe diabetes symptoms. I was struggling with the increased course load and failing to recover my grades as Dad continued to sink deeper and deeper into an obsession with those completely imaginary PhDs. One day dad started taking me to visit some old man from his crazy cult who was bedridden from his own terminal heart problems. 

More years went by and both dad and the old guy were both alive. That meant that Dad had been in the final stages of terminal illness for something like 6 years. I realized that he had been outrageously exaggerating his health problems and that I had spent the last several of them going along with his delusional nonsense

"I'm in college and everything is ruined. I've failed my maths class for the third time so I'm excluded from and science and business majors. My gpa is shit. My degree advisor says to major in something in humanities. Aka end up poor and with no job prospects after college.

I can't even attend next semester because I have no money. I was hit in a car accident on my bike and had to spend my tuition money on it. I also couldn't afford insurance. I can't get a loan for school so I'm fucked. There are no other options. I've maxed out my credit card for food and rent because I couldn't work with a broken leg.

I have no friends or family to help me. Therapy is pointless. Hotlines don't work. Group therapy doesn't work. I've reached out for help like people said. It's over. People always say â€œtalk to a therapistâ€ as if everything gets fixed but it doesn't. Maybe for your small issues. 

I've never been loved or cared about. I only have myself. Now is the end. I've had depression since I was 8. I should've expected this. I wish I hadn't wasted my time thinking things could get better. I should've done this in high school. Goodbye.",2

"I don't know how to keep going. I drove away the person I loved the most in the world. I never loved someone like this. But I lied and told him I was completely over my ex. I wasn't. He said he would leave me if I did. So I lied. And later he found texts. I broke up with my ex for him. But he found us talking about our relationship. I still love you, I told her. He was heartbroken. You cheated on me, he said. I insisted no, it was breaking trust, but you can't say cheating. I apologized so much. I changed so many behaviors. I couldn't make it up to him. He finally came to me, didn't talk to me two months, and said, you cheated on me, you manipulated me. I'm done. He did many things that hurt me during the whole time we knew each other. He left me and came back so many times. It got worse and worse. But it's not an exchange. No matter his actions, I should have done better. I lost him. He was right. It took me so many months to understand what he really meant. I thought of this every day. Now I get it. I destroyed him. I loved him so much. But this was so disrespectful. I'll never see him again. I'll never get to love him again. I did such a bad thing. He'll never care for me. I need to die. I know everyone will convince me no. But I do. I can't move on. I can't forgive myself.

How could I not have seen it? How could I not have begged for forgiveness? I hurt him so bad. He wanted to kill himself, it hurt him so bad. I deserve it! To feel like this! I can't forgive myself. I can't solve this. I can't get what I want out of this. He's so far moved on. It's over, it's done, I can't get over it. I want him back so badly. I miss him so much.

Why should I endure the pain the pain of living in this society the pain of living in a shitty family the pain of life itself think about it we come in to this world bloody and crying is it a way for baby begging not to be born? If u believe in incarnation it actually make sense right? I just been thinking a lot 

The sad truth is half of the people on this sub that giving advice to people who about to give up is just on the high of depression right now what I mean is u like all of us here been dealing with depression and maybe u getting better or u think this time it ganna be different maybe this is last time I'm feeling better right 
I'm in the high right now I see hope!!! well here the sad truth all of u ganna RELAPSE like everytime some of u notice it and try to stop the depression some of u don't and go down to the devil we called depression even deeper it just a constant battle it just kinda funny to me that people giving advice in a few months they be here waiting for advice cos they relapse

All of this is my final thought this will just get lost in thousands of post here I'm about to turn 20 in a few months ganna do it before 20 I will plan it precisely and as perfect as possible the place to do it the material cut off all my connections deleted all my social media burn my phone and ID be on drug or heavily on alcohol to make my body weaker to fight my survival instinct that will get in the way I watch countless suicide video fail to learn the mistake they make so I will not fail

"Just as my month long problem was slowly coming to an end and thing's were looking somewhat up for me more stress and worry has been thrown at me. 


After a month of stressing over getting back into my main group of friends who decided some separation would benefit everyone I learn that I was likely not going to be welcomed back...least not by the few members who genuinely didn't like me. My closest friend had a heart to heart with me about it and even though it still hurts losing the only place I felt I could relax and enjoy myself I was starting to let it go now that I knew I didn't have to worry about coming back. Still have some hangups about it all but again it was all getting better. 


Then I dont here from my Girlfriend for 3 days, finally getting a message from her the day after my birthday with her saying she's dealing with stuff and that none of its my fault and that I didnt do anything. She wont talk to me about it whatever it is and I know its bad cause she isn't acting like herself. Part of me is afraid it has to do with me but isn't my fault. I talked with a close friend and I was able to regain some of my reasoning to eventually tell her that until she wants to talk with me I'll leave her be and give her space to think. But it's still a bit disheartening that she doesn't say I love you back...its been 2 insistence and the second time she just said ""You Too"" so maybe she's just distracted by her thoughts and forgot. 


This year has been the saddest year of all for me, I wont say depressing cause I haven't been diagnosed, and I'm just hoping these feelings go away cause I'm not myself and that annoys me to no end. I'm the guy who helps others, talks them through their issues, makes people laugh, makes others happy. I'm not the sad, whimpering, insecure, paranoid guy I'm acting like...

I can't make progress I've tried to force myself but that seems to just make things worse, I also don't have it that bad so I feel like I'm unrelatable.

I want to kill myself, I want this stupid life to end, every single day is the same. I can't even feel positive emotions anymore like happy or excited. All I ever can feel is sad, annoyed, angry, upset, and insecure. I barely even feel empathy. I feel like my brain is wired backwards. I just want, more than anything, for this life to end. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I don't want to hurt those close to me, but everyday I pray and hope that some natural cause takes me out so I don't have to continue.

my school went and fired the two ELSA therapists because apparently they are â€˜redundant' the school made up so many lies about them not helping anyone and that they were basically useless. i was on track to feeling better with my sessions with one of them but now they got fired and ive fallen back down the deep depression and self harm hole again i also have social anxiety and dont feel confident to see the therapist outside of school and i don't feel confident talking to my parents. the lady I saw i had known since getting there and i felt comfortable talking to her and now i have no one. i honestly give up with school entirely as if your not feeling very mentally well today and put your head down off u pop for a lovely 24 hour vacation in solitary confinement the â€˜learning hub' fuck this shit,5
"So after ages I finally asked my Crush (and one of my best friends) out on a date. And she said yes.This made me the fking happiest i've bin in forever. After 2 months of dating I realized that we were taking it very slowly. I thought it was fine, good things need their time to blossom. 
After another 2 months I realized that i was suffering under these circumstances and that it was really hard for me not knowing if she still liked me back. Yes we kissed and yes she initiated it once but two weeks ago this happened:

After one of the best nights i ever had, we were talking in the car and I just asked if everything was alright with ""us"". After a moment of silence I dreaded her answer and then she startet trying to say something. She tried and tried again and again until she finally said: "" I am in love with someone else... And the thing is it's not another male.""This has been really hard on me. I don't think she's a Lesbian but i, felt how insecure she was about her own sexuallity and that she was sooo afraid that people would not accept her anymore. Now i am stuck in a wierd af situation. I still really love her and I feel like giving up on ""us"" isn't even an option. She has been one of my best friend in ages and I dont want to loose her. But i dont know if its healthy for me if we keep on seeing each other or hanging out. I mean i've been kinda depressed for a while now, the bad feelings and thought come and go.

I'm also worried that if I distance myself from her that it would intensify her insecurites.

If she were in love with another guy i'd probalby stop seeing her tho, wouldn't I? Or at least I should, shouldn't I?

I told her that we have to talk and we are going to meet on Sunday. I just dont know what i want to tell her. That I love her? That we are done? That we are cool and that she should sort her stuff out?That she's a bitch for dating me for months with no intention of being in a relationship? I have pretty bad moodswings and don't know what I really feel. 
I just know that things can't stay the same as they are now.

This shit has been really hard on me.I mean seriously I think about her ALL THE TIME. Everything reminds me of the awsome times we had and now I cant even watch lebian Pron without being blue.Thanks for reading...",4
"what should I do in the meantime? I thought about planting flowers and hanging out with friends. also will try to make a comics. 

btw don't suggest getting help, i already go to the therapist and take AD, I just can't handle my life anymore. school has been very hard for me, I constantly feel tired, my marks got worse, I lost all motivation to keep going. there are more reason but I don't feel like sharing.

who knows, maybe in a couple of months I will feel better? thanks in advance!! ðŸ’–",2

"Life is really hard even tho my life is relatively good for now but I am not happy. Everyday I question why I'm in college hating every second of it. To work for the rest of my life? For what? Why am I so lazy and unmotivated. My least favorite thing about college is the PEOPLE. I just want to stay inside.

I had to skip therapy this week because I have too much pointless school work to do. 

I'm lucky to even have therapy but I won't anymore when I turn 25. I am 23 now.",2
"I had a bad childhood growing up. My parents were addicts and all they cared about was their addiction, so I grew up pretty much being raised and cared for by my brother and my grandmother. I've suffered through child bias, sexual assault, and a hefty handful of mental illness throughout my life, and I'm just so tired of negativity. I struggled throughout my childhood with the hope that things would be better when I became an adult and got away from that lifestyle, but it's not. It feels like the whole damn world is just as hateful and cruel and nasty as my childhood was. How do you wake up in the morning and continue to go on when you haven't a hope in the world things are ever going to ""get better""? How do you wake up and brave the bullsh** of life when everywhere you look you see nothing but hate? Whenever I try to talk about it, I'm greeted with ""that's life"" or ""welcome to adulthood"" and I'm tired of it already. I'm tired of ""tough love"". I just can't wrap my mind around how so many people can be so hateful towards each other. People killing each other left and right, hating each other for the color of their skin, for the way they dress, the people they love, and the higher powers they choose to believe in. I just don't understand it all. My heart aches. I feel like a sad, lonely little girl who started running through a dark tunnel towards the light only to be greeted with a punch to the gut and a spit in the face when coming out the other end. I'll wake up every morning and live my life still, I'll go to work and do my job, make my money and pay my bills, but the light died in me a long time ago. I just hope the embers still burn and I'll find my spark again someday, but until then, existing will have to do.",4

"These are just random things because I guess I need a hug. 


I've been feeling so lonely lately. I can't do even basic stuff, like I need to motivate myself to take a shower or find reasons to eat something. I'm finally taking some medication. I still struggle with finding a job, but it's okay I guess, kinda regret wasting all my money and not saving more. That's like a coping mechanism. I starve myself and then feel sick again. I can't motivate myself to workout because I don't have any limits and I either don't do anything or workout till I'm exhausted. I either cry a lot because of everything or feel nothing at all. I have like two friends now and my boyfriend. I appreciate them the most. But I really hate myself for not being able to have phone calls with my boyfriend(we're in a long distance rn). I really love him and I want to change it but I can't make myself do that?? Like he knows about my issues and he's very patient and supportive but I have a feeling like I'm bothering him al the tome and making him feel sad because calling someone you love is like the very basic thing that can make you feel closer to each other. But that's not the point of my post, I have no idea if it even makes sense. 



I'm so tired, I'm not feeling broken, I'm not having desire to end my life because I know that it's just temporary and I'll be fine. But I'm feeling extremely not motivated at all, I'm sad and I hate myself for not being productive. I'm afraid to lose my boyfriend or my friends and I hate being that annoying person who always asks â€œyou don't regret our relationshipâ€. I'm tired and I have no idea what to do. I've been feeling so sad lately and very stressed and I can't sleep and I have headaches all the time. I just want to cry and to get a hug maybe. 



No, I'm definitely not seeking any attention at all, I'm really sorry if it looks like that. I'm sad and that's it I guess.",5
"Hey Reddit. I've been debating posting on here for a while but I'm having more suicidal thoughts than ever before and I just need to get this all of my chest. I'm 32, male. I have an amazing girlfriend who is way out of my league and a fun job I enjoy and yet, here I am. 

Despite having some really good parts of my life, I'm slammed by thoughts of being worthless and just living a pointless existence. I'm in debt up to my eyeballs and my credit is trashed. I feel like despite getting a $15,000 raise at work, I'm still nowhere near where I want to be at this point in my life. I feel like I have no tangible future and am just waiting to die one day. In the past 4 years I've lost my father and my grandmother, two of the most influential people in my life. I'm in the process of moving but am having a difficult time finding good apartments because of my credit so Ive been forced to stay with my mom until I'm settled. I travel for my job and my car is falling apart but I don't have good replacement options again because of the credit issue. I'm ridden with anxiety about everything and fear of future issues prevents me from enjoying the now. To top it all off, I was visiting my girlfriend this weekend who lives a few hours away from me and I severely inured my knee and I can't walk. I have to find a surgeon and probably have an operation and she wants to take care of me hand and foot but it just makes me feel like I'm a giant burden. She's so amazing and I feel like I don't offer anything financially and am just a 32 dependent who, as of right now can barely make it to the bathroom because of this damn leg. 

I am an atheist. I don't believe in any form of an afterlife as I just can't accept something with no evidence. I firmly believe in my heart that my grandmother and father are gone. Aside from their graves nothing remains of them and they are not in another realm enjoying themselves. All that exists for then is the black void of nothingness. And despite so many rays of sunshine in my dark life, I feel so envious of them. To not have to feel this anxiety and pain anymore is such an appealing feeling to me. This world is such a terrible place where ignorance and hate have run so rampant and people take such joy in hurting their fellow man. What future can society have with a foundation like this? I find myself thinking about ending everything on a near daily basis. I see lots of redditors posting here about how they are excited for some kind of afterlife because they can't accept that this is the best we can do. But for me, an absence of anything would be as good as the existence of a heaven. 

I feel better having laid all this out in text but I still find myself objectively weighing the pros and cons of ending my life. So I don't know what I was hoping for by posting this. Maybe I need someone to talk me off the ledge... who knows. But in all honestly, leaping from the ledge looks better and bettter with each passing minute...",2

"i don't care how others would feel about it anymore. don't have any motivation to move forward at all. i feel hated. don't feel like anyone loves me. don't feel like anyone cares. i already hate myself. 14 and have little to no friends. i want people to talk to me, they know i want them to, but they just keep me away like i'm a nuisance. i probably am one. i mean.... i am one to myself. sooner or later imma be gone and i'll be fucking happy. a 14 year old girl with nothing to live forðŸ™ƒ. great.",5
"I'm nearly 23 years old. My father abandoned our family when I was 14. He was my best friend at the time... I haven't seen him in 6 years. This void made me become extremely close to my few friends. My clinginess reached a point where they got fed up from me and my anxiety and paranoia, that I've now lost my closest friends. I used to reach out to them for help, but it reached a point where everything was on their shoulders and they couldn't handle it anymore, so they distanced themselves with time. 
I used to be more fit and more attractive, but my life has taken a downwards spiral. I've gained about 70 lbs and my self-consciousness eats me up on the inside. My anxiety is through the roof and I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I'm on anxiety meds but truly think I should be on anti-depressants. I am now failing out of school and I don't have the heart to tell my mother. It will break her, but also I know that once she finds out, my life will probably turn into more of a hell, as she's always had extremely high standards for me. 

I'm still a virgin. I've never had a girlfriend. I was seeing this girl when I was 17, but that was about it. And that was at my peak attractiveness. It is now laughable how unattractive I am. People will literally laugh at me because of my appearance. My self-confidence is inexistent. I get anxiety attacks when people just look at me because I think that they are judging me on how I look. I can't deal with this anymore.

I moved away from my hometown 3 years ago for university. I haven't made a single new friend. I live alone. I literally don't use my voice anymore because I have no one to talk to. It reaches the point where I talk to myself because I'm scared that if I go without talking for so long that I will lose my voice. The only time I used to use my voice was while playing video-games online, it was the only thing that brought me a bit of joy. But my console broke, and I can't afford to fix it.

I have no ambitions. I don't know what I want to do in life. Everyone around me seems to have it figured out. Meanwhile, I'm a loser that is eating his life away. The only future I envision having is honestly the one where I throw myself off of my apartment building. I think about just ending it all the time. 

I feel alone in this world, and I don't have the motivation nor the self-confidence to do anything about it. The only people that may care about me are the couple family members I have, but I have put them under so much shit for all of the stuff I've done in the past that they are fed up with me. I want to kill myself, I just want to fall asleep and never wake up.",4

"For the record, I'm not trying to feel sorry for myself or try to gather sympathy but I'm done. All my life I've let people walk all over, I've always put everyone else before myself, and I've gone above beyond for people. I don't know why people don't like me or be around me. I have gone to therapy for years to better myself and always tried to be the best person I can but it didn't work. 

I hate myself so much. I am a burden to my parents, very few people care about me and I am a waste of space to be alive. I know my parents will be upset but they will get over it quickly because they have my brother who is extremely intelligent, handsome and very well-liked. My dad will for sure be okay because he had two kids from a previous marriage and one's a doctor about to get engaged and the other owns her marketing agency and is married to a great guy with two beautiful children. I come from a family of overachievers and I have never measured no matter how hard I tried. They are also very attractive people and for some reason, I came out looking so deformed and ugly. I just feel like there is no point in trying anymore. I screw up all the time, I am a huge loser and very few people like me. It's better I do this now than waste another 25 years alone. 

When I'm gone I will disappear into the background and it will be as if I was never here. I tried to fight for so long but I'm done!",5
"My mom is literary the only person in the world who truly cares about me. For everyone else, I pretty much just exist in the background, or people just use me. I have had periods of intense depression in my life and there have been so many times when I've contemplated self harm, but never dared to actually take action just because I thought about how much my mom loves me and how sad she would be if I hurt myself. She has done so much for me, &amp; I don't think I could ever be half as good a mom as she was. When I was in the hospital for pretty much a whole year in tremendous pain, I never even had 1 visitor, but I didn't really care that my friends didn't visit me for a year, because she never left me and that was more than enough. 

The past month or so, she's been suffering with her own health issues, which have now grown so severe the doctors are almost positive it's cancer or ALS. I'm trying to keep my hopes up that this is just some kind of short term problem, but every day it worsens, the more I can't stop myself from thinking about the possibility of life without her. And that's a thought that I cannot bear. Life would be pointless and I would truly be all on my own. I want nothing more than to be able to take away her pain.",4
"Is it just me or does the world seem to be fucked ever since 2012. I wish the world ended in 2012 so I wouldn't have to deal with all the bullshit that I have been through. 

I'm currently in debt by like $25000, I work a full time job that is dependent on weather and the sea. My job pays well through winter but once summer hits I get paid fuck all. When I fall fully into a depressive/dilussional state of mind. My brain races at 100 miles an hour at all times, every little thing I over analyse. I have seen my only friend go through drug addiction and drug related psychosis. I have seen how life can shit all over you. 

My depression started at an early age because of bullying and lack of friends. Except the one in my life currently, you can't destroy our relationship. I feel like my depression really kicked in when I was around 15 or 16. My friend moved away to another city and I was left all alone. At the time bullying got worse and I made a few acquaintances but no real close friends. When I was 17 I dropped out of school and moved out of my family home. I started to have panic attacks in the shower and that was when I turned to drugs to numb the pain. Xanax was my go to for sedation as I could fight the effects somehow I loved that. Iv been a daily cannabis smoker for most of the time since I was 16 except the times I ran out and couldn't get anymore. I have done lots of psychedelics (u could call me a psychonaut) any sort of alternate reality really. Cannabis helps motivate me to stuff. 

I'm currently 19, still a virgin and struggling with financial situations. I only just earn enough money every week to cover my bills so I never really buy anything for myself except weed. I can never seem to get ahead of my depression. It's like it just keeps dragging me down. When I'm really depressed I choose to sleep most of the day as sleeping is the only place where I can shut the fuck up. (I have lucid dreams all the time). 

If you actually read this good on you, I'm fucking done with life.",1
"I'm almost 31 and a nurse. I own my own home in a capital city in Australia and have roughly 2/3 of the mortgage paid off. Despite these successes, I feel like a failure. I've pretty much lived my whole adult life in a way that is completely inauthentic to how I really feel inside. It's like I haven't let myself free in any way.

I always wanted to be a translator of Japanese, but I chose nursing because it was much more stable and I lacked confidence. In my early 20s I had an ED and I let guys use me for sex (I've only slept with 4 people but looking back I don't think I wanted to sleep with any of them). I used to have a nice slim figure but I've put on a few pounds from binge eating (not fat) and I'm working on losing it. I have pretty much no friends and don't really socialise outside work. I can't drive. I haven't had sex since I was 24. I've never had what you would call a proper, grown-up relationship.

I am thinking about learning a language in the hopes of changing career, but I feel like a total loser. Being 31, I feel like I'm 'over the hill' and there's no chance for me to become proficient in a skill or to succeed. I feel like no-one cares what I do, I could literally just live in my house with my cats getting fatter and fatter until I died. I seem to be obsessing over a guy who used me pretty badly at university who got married to a ballet dancer recently. I keep thinking, there's a quality woman, she's so talented, I'll never be talented like that. What's the point?

"Hi I'm 23 years old
It was October 2019,
I was having intense headaches and nausea, it was my birthday the 24th. My family thought it was normal because of my period 2 weeks go by the pain is worse and in tense. I was taken to a hospital, and a neurologist saw me and said I had no signs of any problems whatsoever but to make sure he prescribed me declofenac and to get a resonance on my head. 

No tumors where found and the declofenac made my problems worsen, I went to a different hospital where my grandmother sister works as head of emergency and pediatrician. The doctor who attended me stated I was fine and had nothing, I studied for a nursing license and knew the look in the doctors face when I told her I'm still in pain after administrating medication was of ""she just wants drugs"" face. I told my grandmas sister and she told me, that the doctor who attended me they always fight because of her attitude and insinuation on patients. At this time I was already 2 months in pain, my family tried to look for other know neurologist in the field to see what's going on and none of them knew.

3 months I was talking to a friend and just for a moment I felt numb, numb as in I didn't feel any pain. My dad got scared and saw my left eye drift away, he took me to a oftalmologist. He didn't know what's going on when he checked me so he referred me to a hospital specialized in neuro-oftalmologist. I went through the emergency room and I was obviously angry frustrated you name it. The doctor checked my eyes and told me I had papilledema, and it might be cause by the birth control pills since I was always having issues with my hormones. The blood pressured my eyes thus having nausea, headaches, desoroentation, sensitivity to light, and insomnia.

I was treated for papilledema and I can't use any birth control whatsoever, but now I'm still sensitive to light and I see like those huge TVs in the 90s and VHS. Because my left eye was left with nerve damage, I can't see my peripheral view from both my eyes. the left eye its been losing the blur I see and it's getting darker, as in pitch black and have like a 1cm of blurred or I think even less. I'm also not being able to see most colors or differentiate in deepness (as in stairs, steps, holes etc) 

It's been 6 months now..

I changed doctors, learned myself to go through my surroundings without depending in my eye sight. I no longer have papilledema and I still get headaches even when I try to force my eye sigth, plus In December we found out my knees is more above than usual and that's why it pops out. But that time it popped out it didn't went in and now I have to use kinesiology tape to have support and control over it.

I've been snapping at a lot of people degrading me, telling me it's nothing, people are in worse situations be grateful.

But I'm not allowed to snap, I'm not allowed to defend myself, I'm not allowed to call people out when they make me feel like I've literally gone through nothing.

I have no friends, and the people I know don't know my position. Because they literally don't give a sh*T

Im social whenever I can and this was my actual fear losing my eye sight. I'm not afraid of risking it, making hard decisions, animals, crisis. My fear is actually coming true..

How am I not going to feel depressed, sad, upset, angry, frustrated....

HOW?! I literally use the keyboard voice option instead of writing and Google assistant.

Everything I liked reading books, watching old movies, going to cons...

And the worse part is my son hides from me every time he gets because he already knows mommy can't see, so I freak out when I can't hear him or feel him in the house.

I don't think there's something on my mind making me worried, I'm just feeling weird inside and I can't pinpoint what's the problem.

"I don't understand how I'm feeling and all I can describe it as is numbness but it's past that point and I've felt like this for a long time, I feel like I don't belong to this life like it isn't for me. I can't see myself in any career, my own family my own little life I can't see it , I'm so disconnected from social interaction I don't leave my house much and the sad thing is as much as I hate it I don't want to change it I have no motivation I'm so tired to the point I don't see a point on living when I'm so tired I can't do daily life like everyone. What is the point to this life? How do you really find happiness I feel nothing I get the occasional anger and I'm always Irritated but besides that I feel nothing and I hate it I can't cry I can't laugh I can't feel anything",5
"If I get any amount of upvotes or comments o just get super happy, because for once somebody appreciates me

"30 days. 


In 30 days, I will know if I failed a class for the 4th time, I'll know if the only thing I've been looking forward to the past year can actually make me happy, and I'll get paid, so I will be able to afford a gun. I'll clean my room, pay my Bill's, and maybe write some notes. I've never felt so prepared for the future.",2
"hi, id like some advice if that's possible. i suffer from extreme anxiety due to environmental and emotional stressors. this makes it extremely difficult to physically sit down and complete schoolwork before the deadline. i also miss a lot of classes because i am scared of confrontation.

just yesterday i submitted a late essay assigned a few weeks back that was half assed and didn't even meet the page number requirements. this just perpetuates the existing anxiety because now i have to face the teacher tomorrow morning and possibly be questioned about my quality of work. i have a 504 plan but the thought of asking for extensions or additional help makes me feel pathetic.

anxiety + depression + an untreated eating disorder has caused my grades to falter ever since the start of last year . i am a senior in high school and am deathly afraid of being deferred from the colleges that i have been accepted to. the fact that i can't keep up with high school work suggests that ill fail at college too

i've started becoming suicidal due to this. body dysmorphia makes it difficult just to step outside of my house. i have no friends, i am lonely and comfort myself with food, which i usually throw up after. the only people willing to listen to me are adults who are paid to do so

i fear that other people view me as undisciplined and lazy, or just plain stupid. there is no evidence against these perspectives as i keep all of my mental struggles hidden. in reality i am investing all of my energy just to haul my ass out of bed in the morning and get through the day. my mom works long shifts to sustain me but i as her child have nothing to offer in return- no friends or partners to introduce her to, no academic success or improvement, etc. on top of that she has to schedule all of my psych and therapy appointments which is difficult for her as a parent. she'd be better off if i weren't here to burden her. 

i have a bunch of upcoming psych appointments and have my fingers crossed to be prescribed medicine. maybe i'd sulk less on some zoloft? but i know this isn't a way out at least not a permanent one. 

i am tired and want it all to end. i know better than to end my life over a situation i'll be out of in a few months but i can't stand the thought of dealing with this any longer.",3

"I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try. I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but been unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars then needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later..

I just literally can't take anymore of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum. I am just so tired of fighting and so tired of going through life like this barely being able to breath and barely being able to survive and have absolutely nothing to show for it.",3
"Im not sure if this is the place to post this but here we go. Apologies in advance this is going to be all over the place, im on mobile and im lost. Not real names, this is a throw away etc etc etc.
Okay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.
I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a ""happy"" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to ""protect"" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS would pick on me. So I accepted ""who I was"" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming ""DONT TOUCH ME GERM"" ""GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF"" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) ""You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak"". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me ""mysteriouslyreddited"". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell ""get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!"". I replied with ""well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are"" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and ""ignored"" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well). I'm not looking for help I just need to talk to someone. I am doing okay I just had so much pent up I needed a release. Next therapy session will hopefully straighten up my current state of mind",1
"Fuck anhedonia. I'm tired of people telling me to fake it til I make it; I'm tired of people giving me suggestions that work for a neurotypical person but not for someone with anhedonia. Nothing is interesting, nothing brings any pleasure or joy. It legitimately feels like my brain is rotting. Every second that I'm alive feels like absolute hell.


I've dealt with this shit for too long. I'm tired of it. For years I've felt like I'm already dead. I really wish I could just die already.",5
"Where did I fuck up? 
What did I do wrong?
Did I not give you enough sex? 
Did I give you too much attention? 
Was I not enough of a challenge? 
Is our relationship real?

"It's not that I hate working but... no, it is precisely that I hate working. I just can't come to terms with the thought that I'm going to waste a huge part of my life doing things I don't like to do. 
For what? I don't see the point on working hard and achieving all these career goals if the only time I'm going to have to myself would be after I retire â€” IF I'm ever going to retire and not just drop dead in my 50/60s. 
I'm 27 and I have no idea how to live this life, my supposedly only chance at sentience. I'm depressed due to a lot of things: physical health problems, not being able to find a job that I'm going to at least tolerate, feeling generally lost in life.
I hated all the jobs I've been at, ALL OF THEM. It majorly contributed to my suicidal tendencies and I quit my last job with this awful premonition that if I'm not going to quit asap, I'm going to kill myself. 
My family doesn't understand because 'Everybody's gotta work for a living' (the usual), they kind of resent me now for being like this. I'd gladly drink all the Kool-Aid of this world and be a relatively happy working drone at this point in my life, but my mind just isnt wired that way.
I'm tired of constantly feeling depressed, guilty, angry at this world and myself. I feel absolutely alone, even thought I know that I'm not alone in this type of thinking.
Right now I just feel empty, like there's no way out of this, lile I have nothing to live for.
Sorry for this rant. I know I'm just writing it for attention, or maybe for some sort of connection to another human being.",2
"I hate myself, and I want to die more than anything. People always say it gets better, but how can it get better when you're the problem? I don't hate life. Actually, I really enjoy life. I love most of the people I meet, and my dog, and listening to music while watching the sunset and looking at the stars and reading books and hanging out with friends and walking outside after it rains and smelling the fresh air and getting to see people smile. The problem is me. I'm a bad person and I hate the way I am. Everyday I wake up and feel guilty for being alive and having to subject the outside world to the unpleasantness that i am. I hate getting out of bed and having to look in the mirror and see myself and be reminded that I'm me. I literally can't stand feeling like this anymore. I hate people telling me I need confidence. I'm clearing missing more than that. I don't think I can ever like myself, and that's why I want to die. I want to enjoy life, and all the amazing things it has to offer, but not really. How can I when I'm literally my least favorite person I've ever met?",1
"My first post ever on reddit. Im feeling so low right now, been crying all night, and I just want to get better, but nothing seems to work. During Christmas vacation, I realised my partner had been cheating on me, the night I founded out, he went to that girl house and had intercourse with her. He still came back to my place after and told me everything the next day. I completely lost it, It was the first time someone cheated on me. I felt betrayed, and couldnt wrap my head around it. My reaction was to drink as much alcool, smoke cigarette until I could forget what happen.. unfortunately that wasnt enough I was still feeling so much pain. I than decides to take a half empty bottle of xanax with a bottle of antidepressant. Just to wash the pain away, just like that I was doing my first suicide attempt. 20 minutes after I realised what I had done and called emergency, an ambulance came over and I spent 24 hours at psychiatry aisle. I started seeing a psychiatrist after that, and was diagnosed for borderline personality. For me it makes sense, but it seems close friend and family think its too much, that Im not borderline.. thing is Im really good at hiding my true self. Ive been boulimic for years without anyone ever knew I was. Ive been having intense rage and impulsive reaction when Im in love. 

Anyway.. lets come back to my story, I ended up staying with my partner, a decision that has been torturing me ever since. There is not a day that passes without me thinking he would so ut again. I will think about what happened imagining it until I start feeling sick, and than everything turns black again. I havent been easy with him after that, but how could I ? 

My psychiatrist just prescribed me a new drug to mix with my antidepressants and I started them yesterday, I hate all the side effect if taking a new drugs and I just feel like I want to give up. ive been having a lot of fights with my partner in the last days cause I dont find him supportive. I feel so alone right now, I tried to communicate with him but its just too much, I feel like a burden for him and its been breaking me even more.

There is so much in life that I wanted, like I always wanted to have a kid, but I feel so unlovable... I feel like my mental health is taking too much place, I need help. 

I need a reason to keep going",4
"First off, I wanted to say to you all in the group, things do get better. With years of therapy and medication I feel like I'm on the path to healing. I was depressed as long as I can remember and it does get better, hang on. 

But, I'm doing so well I'm afraid the only reason I've started to actually love myself and feel happiness is because of my medication. I don't want to be medicated my entire life, I want to find ways to be happy and love myself without it, and I'm scared when I'm off of meds, I'll go back to the same me. Anyone have this experience? Any advice?",0
"It's time for me to show everyone what happens when u treat someone so bad that they want to kill themselves. The rejection, the leaving, the being ignored, the being bullied and made fun of. I'm tired of the bias everyone is giving me. I'm tired of it. I can't take it anymore. No one wants be my friend, especially irl. No one wants to be my girl friend. No one even gives me a chance. All they do is bias me and I'm tired of it. I'll show everyone what happens when u treat someone like I've been treated. No love, just bias. I'll show them. And maybe, it could save some lives too. U will see. U all will see.",1

"Dear Diary,

I feel myself, yet again, sliding into the abyss of darkness.

Is it better that I remain fueled by anger and frustration at the CCP? When hopelessness overtakes anger, I feel sucked into a swirling vortex of desolation.

Knives, scissors, any shiny sharp object - they all beckon warmly, seducing me with sweet promises of an end to this pain.

Carefully laid plans, budgets, all gone awry because of a situation beyond control. Exacerbated by one man's greed for power and face.

I fear to run out of anger. When fury no longer triggers, and desolation lays waste to sanity, it would probably be the beginning of the end.

Love,

"Hi all, I've dealt with mild depression most of my life and handle it decently through medication, on and off therapy and CBT. 

However I've had 3 failed shoulder surgeries since 2016 and my shoulder pain triggers relapses into anger, depression, and feeling bad for myself. I can't play basketball anymore which I loved, I have trouble holding and playing with my two young daughters as well. When I try something that I can no longer do (our daughter on my shoulders or shoot hoops in the driveway) it usually means I will be down for the rest of the day. 

I know people deal with much more serious strokes of misfortune than a bad arm but I often spiral into feeling bad for myself and being mad at myself for the basketball plays that led to the original injuries. 

Does anyone recommend a book, a method of CBT or any advice for me to deal with this better?

Thanks in advance, I appreciate reading this sub, this is my first time posting.",3

I've never been good at making friends. I never had any through middle school. Last year I made one though. We got really close but after I told him about my depression he seemed to drift off. Yesterday morning while we were talking he said he had to meet up with his teacher and told me that he'd tell me once he's done. As I was walking around the halls I saw him with a group of other people. I don't care that he was with others considering things have gotten awkward between us. what bothered me was that he just ditched me. I'd much rather have been told that he was going to meet some of his other friends. I dont have anyone tanymore because after that he just said that he doesn't want to see me anymore.,0
"Seriously like a 9-5 isnt my forte, I hate kids, I don't have the ability to pursue both my passions and a job, everyone in my life uses me for emotional support but no I'm a downer if I ever do the same.

I think I've honestly had enough living at this point and I dont wanna hate myself anylonger",2
"Me : 21yo french garbage
My parents made me go to engineering school, far from their home in paris, after 3 years of preparatory in maths and physics . I immediatly hated the school, i did a few entreprise visit with my class and i knew i didnt want to be an engineer. I d rather kill myself than becoming one engislave. I made really good friends in this city tho, even if i wasn't going to school anymore at one point i was still very happy because of them.

So i told my parents i wanted to stop engineering school, that i wanted to get a job until next year when i will go study something i always dreamt about, becoming a doctor. I went back home for holidays, 3 weeks ago.

I have rough background story with my parents, i'm always in conflict with them and until last summer they always solved conflicts by hitting me or insulting me, saying horrible things that made me hate them. They did make me sleep outside for a few days when i was still a good student in preparatory class, they made me bleed several times, my dad with a sharped stick of wood and my mom with her nails.

I told them i wanted to get a job in the city i was studying, far from home, because i could be near my friends. I told them being home with them was torture, that it was making me go insane and suicidal. I'm still at their home rn, i have a job, but i still want to go live in this city, with my friends and my girlfriend who lives there and to get a job there. Nobody talks to me at home, they took my computer and my credit card. I cant go out, i cant see any friend nearby, i cant do anything or enjoy life. 

They want me stay here, no discussion possible. They make me want to kill myself, they repeating every time i talk about my friends that they don't care about me, that they think i'm a looser and a piece of shit because i stopped this school.

I want to go to this city next week, but i dont have my appartment anymore. I don't know how to convince them to pay the rent for just one month, the time for me to get a job and be independent.",2

I don't feel like I am loved and cared for. I don't want to be with someone that has lost their job twice due to drinking on the job. During that time I was talking to someone and my partner was stressed out about and he started to drink more and he lost his job twice because of this and it feels like its my fault that I can't do anything that makes me happy. I don't want to care for someone that doesn't care about my needs, emotional and physically. If I am sick or doesn't feel well, I have to do it myself without someone taking care of me. One time I had a fever and I had to go to work this partner that I am wish was out and never came home, He didn't check up on me and I haven't heard from him. My plans most of the time has to be put on hold because my partner wants to take a nap and I have to be there most of the time. I want someone to love me and not hurt me anymore, I want hugs and kisses and cuddles and being spoiled alittle bit. My partner isnt the right now for me but I havent found the one for me and I am stuck because I am behind on rent and I am trying to built myself up again after going through some stuff of my own.",5
"I wanted to die starting in Jan 2018, but things have only gotten worse.

In summer 2018, those fucks on the Suicide Prevention chatroom called the police when I expressed suicidal ideations, so I was kidnapped and sent to a series of hospital-prisons with junk medical staff. I lost my job due to the hospital stay - and my apartment, car, and dog shortly followed.

Can't get a decent job because my resume is now all fucked up and I have no connections, and I refuse to go back to miserable jobs that pay horribly. I'd rather die than do that for life.

I am about to be sued on $4K debt, and then yesterday I was handed a $6.5K medical bill for treatment that would have been 100% unnecessary had I still had insurance and was able to go to regular check ups.

You fucks on the Suicide Prevention line made my life demonstrably worse. You destroyed the mechanisms that kept me going as an independent and self-sufficient human. Now I have nothing and am in a far worse position (logistically speaking) to be dealing with any of this.

Right now I'm sort of just waiting until where I'm currently staying kicks me out, which should be soon. After that, it's time to die. But I'll be sure to let the responsible parties know their part in this.",2

I feel my heart beating faster and my breathing becomes a mess, I just feel my whole body feel uncomfortable when I am awake. The only time where I don't feel panic, where I don't feel as much negative feelings, is when I lie in bed and my mind is getting ready to sleep. I don't know how long it takes to fall asleep, but if it took 10 minutes, then those 10 minutes is the best I ever felt in the whole day. I know that its not good to sleep so much, but I understand why some people would choose to sleep a lot when they are depressed. I look forward to that peaceful 10 minutes. I wish I could have that feeling throught the day without needing to fall asleep first.",3

them: what's wrong
me: (visibly upset) nothing
them: I know there is something
me: fine. I'm going to kill myself
them: nooo why?

I can't tell them what because they say I'm faking and I'm doing ut for attention so I'm lost. Doesn't help there's a girl at my school who copies me but isn't actually depressed.

"I've never talked about this with anyone, but I really don't want to live anymore. Because what is the point? Why am I here? I can't do anything useful in my life until I become an adult, I ruin almost everything, I cut a lot and am always worried someone will see the scars. I get confused when I see people genuinely enjoying themselves and having fun. It blows my mind. How are they so happy? How can anyone love themselves? I don't love myself. I'm fact I hate myself. Because I deserve it. What use am I to anyone? 

The answer is none. I'm not of any use. And you know why? It's because whenever I've tried to be useful I mess it up. So, what's the point? What the point of enduring an existence that I can't seem to enjoy? I haven't been diagnosed with depression, so I'm not going to claim that I have it. But, what other explanation is there? And even if that is the explanation, does it even matter? Does anything really matter?

To whoever read this all the way through, (I know this sounds cliche) thank you for reading my scattered thoughts and emotions. I hope you have a good day tomorrow.



Update: I haven't been able to talk to my mom as she's kind of having a 'quiet time' day and I don't want to bother her. I also have a question. Would it be unhealthy for her if I talk to her? She has anxiety/panic disorder and although she hasn't had a panic attack in several months I don't want to cause her too much stress. (Sorry I didn't mention this before),",5
"No one's really gonna read this, but yeah. 
I'm 15 years old and got diagnosed with depression when I was 12. I strongly dislike talking about my â€˜negative' feelings, partially because of trauma, partially because I'm afraid people will look at me differently. When I finally did open up about it, it didn't really go well and got immediately dragged to a doctor to see â€˜what's wrong with me'. I'm afraid to open up again. 
Once I got into therapy, literally before the second appointment I send the therapist an email saying I feel much better now and don't need therapy, because I thought it wouldn't work. 
I know bottling up my emotions isn't healthy, but it's all I've been doing my entire life. I do sometimes talk about it online, but that's all, and even then, I just feel awkward and like a burden to the people that have to listen to me. 
I got held back last year because â€˜I didn't feel like going' (which is what I told everyone) when I couldn't get out of bed and tried really hard to not kill myself. I had my second suicide attempt that year. I didn't want to tell anyone, like my teachers, friends or trusted ones because people know me as happy, bubbly, dumb and annoying, or something like that anyway. I feel like a fucking failure. 
I thought my mindset would change over time, but it never did. This year, I'm doing a tiny bit better, I'm less absent, but I'm still not doing great at school. It's not really that it's hard, I just don't have any motivation at all. I always thought I wouldn't make it past 15, or would just end up killing myself anyways so what's the point? 
But I want to stay alive for some of my family and friends. So, suicide isn't an option anymore. What will I do know? I want to live, but I have no motivation at all. It's like everything's just a big joke. I know I should care, but I don't. 
Does anyone have any advice?",4
"I don't have any friends, haven't for years. I go months without talking to anyone and I cry when I see happy people in public. I have a lot of trauma from sexual bias+trafficking and it makes me not want to live in such a sick world. I first got diagnosed with depression when I was 8. I don't see a point in going on. People would say it gets better but it's gotten objectively worse every year for nearly a decade. I'll never be healthy enough to have the life I want. I've tried all sorts of things including CBT, DBT, EMDR, yoga, meditation, behavioral therapy, art therapy, etc. I eat healthy, I do everything I'm supposed to. I've tried dozens of medications ranging from anti depressants to anxiety meds to mood stabilizers, all which in the end have either caused a severe health side effect, made me even more suicidal, or made me psychotic.

If you try to get ""help"" and talk to someone about being suicidal in the US you're just apprehended by police, handcuffed, thrown in an ambulance, and shipped off to a psych ward where staff verbally and physically biass you for the next 72 hours to 2 weeks. (At the youth psych ward by my house they put you in solitary confinement for CRYING). Then you get out feeling even more scared and hopeless, disgruntled with the world and sickened by the fact that this is the ""help"" out there. Then you get more suicidal because you were just biasd for days on end and realize there's literally nothing you can do. So you'll get locked in the psych ward again, be treated like shit again, continue getting more depressed, angry, and resentful, rinse and repeat. The system just chips away at you until there's nothing left so that you finally off yourself so they don't have to deal with you anymore.",1

"Hello. Never really wrote about myself online but I'm very curious and the stigma behind death seems to discourage discussion of it. I've actively tried talking to my family and a therapist about my perception of my life but their inability to understand that it does not and never has stemmed from depression irritates me. 

I want to die. I believe that death is the ultimate end goal for every single human being and rapidly increasing its approach would lead me to the end. Please note, I have a social life. I have close friends at college and at work. I also have a pretty active socia life (I go to a couple parties here and there). I'm in a solid relationship (been together for two years now), and I do not bias drugs or alcohol, only at kick backs or something. I do not have depression, I'm pretty laid back down to earth guy who has never had any mental illness nor any thoughts of worthlessness, extreme sadness etc. 

Personally, the meaningless within life is the main motivator for my methodology. Realistically, the now is true living (due to its value, the past you can't change and the future is unknown). Past the now, life is to be, not happening. Work, sex, love, entertainment, etc. are used to keep individuals living but what for? We work a 9-5 job, we have kids, we do all of these things and yet the reasoning boils down to survival and entertainment. entertainment to keep us looped within an endless cycle of netflix shows or games or tv shows or youtube and survival of work to eat and feed the future generation. realistically, love is a chemical compound effect which sparks to motivate the production of kids. to continue the species. the love of a parent to a child is to prevent child hood death so the child can become a parent and produce more children for the cycle to continue. when you really boil down what life is it's just an endless cycle of continuation within a species. 

Idk i'm just curious if anyone else feels this way. You develop your own meaning in life but that meaning isn't even yours. You are taught that meaning through society and social interactions. Your parents develop that meaning for you and you believe it's yours but in reality it isn't. The pursuit of a good job or a big house or to produce music or to be a serial killer all of these perceptions you learn from society in which you incorporate into your definition of life. how you want to live isn't even your own perception it's just a jumble of social expectations mixed into you.

If anyone can help me understand this it'd be a great help. I just want to know why life has meaning and why we live if not for social pressures, a biological barrier which prevents self harm, your â€œpersonalâ€ meaning, etc.",3

"Hello everyone! I, as well as most people on the subreddit, have depression. I've been struggling with it for a few years. Recently I was prescribed with welbutrin. I must say that I cant express how much better I've been doing. I still have my moments at night but it's definitely not as bad. I've been struggling with my weight for a while as well but I was just laying in bed and had a weird switch get flipped and now I want to change my diet, i want to start going to the gym and be active. It's crazy because I'm lazy as fuck. Maybe doing this will help a lot with my depression. 

I'm scared though because a few years ago I broke my back while playing football. I was really active outdoors. I played football for the school, I kayaked, hiked, etc. Not being able to do those things has caused me to gain a bunch if weight and become insanely depressed. I lost feeling in my toes for 6 months after the initial accident. I wasn't able to do anything active. My toes are fine now but the fact that I'm not able to do what I used to do because of the accident has caused me to be depressed. I dont want to be depressed anymore, I'm sure everyone can relate. I want to get my life back the way it was and the only way I can do it is to step out of my comfort zone and find someone who will be willing to help me achieve my goal. 

Although it may be difficult, I know if I try my hardest I can achieve my goal. I apologize for the rant but this sudden change in my mindset has got me really motivated and honestly a bit emotional. I was scared I'd never find a way out of this rut. I'm also scared to lose this motivation. I dont want this to be a small fluke of motivation and then tomorrow I'm right back at where I was.

"Every day now for years, it's been exactly the same. Wake up, attend online school, get scolded by my teachers and parents for my poor grades and how slow I am, spend hours doing homework I struggle with, be overwhelmed and stressed about my life, cry, go to bed, and repeat. On the weekends I'll either just sit in my room all day watching YouTube or nap all day because I can't even find the energy to get out of bed and do anything. I can't even find the will to finish my overwhelming amounts of homework. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I don't have any skills, talents, or interests, and I can't even get a job since I live in the middle of nowhere and I'm terrified of learning to drive. I don't even really know anything about the real world. I'm just a husk of a person who rots in isolation in my room all day fantasizing about dying. I am so desperately alone and I feel like a absolute worthless moron. My entire life I've never even had one friend to talk or confide in. Every time in the past when I was going to public school and tried to make friends with people I always fucked up and made myself look idiotic because I never understood how to talk to people and form connections with them. I can't even make online friends. No one cares about me, not even my own parents. Every time I try to have a conversation with my mom, (who is the only thing keeping me from not being totally socially isolated as I am pathetically desperate just to have someone talk to me since I have no one else) she doesn't even bother to pretend to listen to me. She has more important things to do than spare a moment of her time talking to me. I get it, but I wish she didn't make it so obvious. 

I just am so tired of trying to survive each day of hell by myself. I don't see how life can get any better when I'm already incapable of achieving anything. It doesn't help either that I'm so scared about the future. I don't know what I want out of my life, and even if I did, I'd have no idea how to get there with how far I've fallen behind everyone else and how unmotivated I am. I'm scared of fucking my life up even more than I already have. Maybe it'd be easier at this point for me to just drown myself to prevent having a depressing future where I'm suffering even more. I don't really know.

"A couple weeks ago, I overdosed on some Xanax I had lying around and chased it down with some vodka. It put me into a deep sleep and that took me around 36 hours to completely recover from. A friend found me at some point during this since I wasn't returning any of their calls and they know what I struggle with. Anyway, for some reason, I haven't really thought about what happened at all since then and I guess I kind of just shook it off (or tried to). But now that I'm thinking about it, I'm questioning what my intent was behind doing what I did. I didn't ""plan"" to kill myself but I remember thinking to myself ""if this kills me, that's okay."" Should I consider this a suicide attempt or just an odd lapse of judgement? I should mention that I have attempted suicide before and the thought process was much different than what happened this time which is part of the reason I'm so confused.",0
"I keep in phone contact with my parents, but sometimes when I make a big mistake I really need someone to hug and cry to. I feel so alone in this world. I don't have any pets either. The friends I have keep in touch but live far away as well. I'm afraid of what will happen when my parents are gone.",5
"There's a bad situation in my group home that i'm unable to handle and they just say live with it and i can't leave bc my parents are sick of me.

"I'm losing everyone and everything around me. I've reached out but no one seems to understand the fight I have within myself in my own head. I have 2 children under 8 yrs old and it aches me to wonder how they'd be without me. I always think okay they have my parents they have their dad. When is someone going to save me from my demons I can't seem to battle anymore. I lost my brother two years ago to suicide and I wish it were me instead. Everyone keeps telling me that time heals all wounds, but no one can tell me what I'm supposed to do right now. Right now I can't sleep. It's right now that I can't eat. Right now I still hear his voice and sense his presence even though I know he's not here. Right now all I seem to do is cry. I know all about time and wounds healing, but even if I had all the time in the world, I still don't know what to do with all this hurt right now. I want to walk away. I'm ready to end it all. This is my last resort. I graduated college for what? I paid thousands of dollars to be told I'm not good enough. I can't make anyone love me. I'll never be enough. I've attempted suicide when I was younger I hid my depression for so long but I don't think anyone realizes how far off the grid I've gone. I'm only 27. I've literally lost everything but my babies. I lost my determination I lost my strive for life. I give up.",4
I need to kill myself but I don't have the guts right now. I'm scared it will go wrong or I'll panic. I have so many reasons to kill myself. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel as much as I desperately want to. I feel so lost and alone.,5
"Not gonna lie, I feel like a fucking dumbass typing this. But I'm failing at life, really want to die, and am too embarrassed to explain to the people closest to me that I would rather die than proceed with my futile attempts at life. So here I am, on reddit, for some unknown fucking reason. I guess I just need to vent and this seems like the best place because I'm sure no one I know will look here. So here it goes

I'm 23. Live in my parents basement with an amazing girl that I really don't deserve. Most of my life I've been the quiet kid. Most people were scared of me in school because of that, but I'm too much of a pussy to actually do anything. Only reason anyone would talk to me was because I played football and went to school with most of my team. 

From elementary school through middle school I was really fucking ugly. Acne was terrible, huge fucking nose, no confidence. Had like 2 encounters with girls during this time period and I was a hardcore â€œnice guy.â€ Those 2 encounters were enough for everyone to realize I'm pretty fucking retarded. So most people avoided me. High school I peaked. (and by peak I really don't mean much. Just the time that I wasn't absolutely pathetic) Met the girl I'm with now, got in really good shape and did pretty good in football. Managed to get fucking C's all throughout though so I got no scholarship for college. 

After high school my parents were amazing enough to pay for my college. 5000 fucking dollars a semester for me to do average my first semester then fail calculus my second semester. After my second semester I let my father convince me that I should go to school closer to home and do electrical engineering. First semester I did average. Next semester I failed fucking Chemistry and lab. Semester after that I failed my chemistry lab again so I had to switch to Computer engineering. Semester after that I failed Pde's. Pretty much every semester after that I've failed classes. Not because I'm not learning the material but because I'm so fucking lazy I don't do half the homework. Usually my homework grades suck but my test scores are good but not good enough to keep me from failing. Every year my parents keep telling me that they are going to make me move out and pay for my own school, but they keep giving me more chances and I keep royal fucking those chances. Honestly don't understand why they give me so many chances. 

Anyways, this year isn't any different. Last semester I took 3 fucking classes (9 credit hours) and failed all three of my classes. Worst I've ever done. So this current semester I'm retaking 2 of the 3 I failed and just had to withdraw from one of them and the other I will probably get a C in. I don't get it. I have a part time job at fucking Chili's, I live at home, have everything going for me; don't have to worry about expenses, amazing girlfriend, family that loves me. Yet I can't fucking pass two fucking classes.

I'm a failure. Honestly no other explanation. I get to tell my mother that after this semester I am dropping out and moving out, therefore waisting 50,000$ of her money. Thing is, if I can't pass two fucking classes how the fuck an I suppose to live on my own. Other thing is, I wouldn't be on my own, my girlfriend would be with me which makes everything worse because I would be dragging her down with me. So instead of moving out I have decided I should probably just kill myself. I've planned it out for the most part. I have a 30-06 in my room that guarantees my death, I've scouted a place out where no one will be able to find my corpse. I haven't written my goodbye letter because I'm honestly too pathetic to write one and probably won't even leave one, I plan on depositing all of my money into an account that my girlfriend has access to so she can get out of this house as quickly as possible if need be, etc...

I know my death will negatively impact those closest too me but I'm almost positive my parents will get over it. Honestly my father has given up on me so I don't think he'll care much. My grandparents will be devastated but they will get over it.
Only one I'm worried about is my girlfriend. She's about to start a new job right when I plan on killing myself and I don't want to ruin that. I'm sure I can figure something out.

At the same time. I really don't want to die. It still breaks my heart that I have to leave everything behind. My family has two amazing dogs that I would die for, I managed to go out with a girl way out of my league for 5 years that's about to get a job relevant to her dream career, I have grandparents, aunts, and uncles that all seem to like me, etc...

Guess I'll just bring a couple bottles to try and get over that heartbreak so I can pull the trigger.

Anyways, sorry to start my own fucking pity party. It was just hurting me to not say or write anything before I die since I've done relatively good at hiding my depression from everyone. 

Thank you for reading.",2

"Hey, I'm a 17yo living in the Uk and i was just looking for any advice on therapy/councelling anyone could share

The only real experience ive had with councelling was having these 'negative thought sessions' when i was like 8/9 it was pretty brief after the person conducting unfortunately fell really ill and had to go off sick and i never really heard from them again, other then that i had one session when i was about 13/14 with the school counsellor when she said she'd check in with me and never did after that.

I just dont want to mess this up, i find reaching out really hard and here i am legitimately trying on my own accord for the first time without anyone elses input

Any advice on how to get therapy or even just what i should do if i do manage to get any sessions somewhere?",0
"On the edge of suicide I can't deal with the pain anymore no one fucking likes me and I'm always nice to them Everythint feels so dry I'm fucking crying

I'm 18 my parents constantly tell me there disappointed in me and my life is going no where and I'm a failure every time iv asked them to stop saying this kind of stuff they say they wouldn't say it if it wasn't true and I have absolutely no one to turn to and am at the lowest iv ever been in a while,4
Spent almost all day at the hospital. Internet down (I'm using a public network to write this) and then I threw up in bed so now I have to change sheets at almost 3am. Geez can't something go right for once?,0
"I don't understand this, I really don't. It feels like I can't make progress. Some days I feel good (better than usual, at least) and others, like today, just feels like I can't do literally anything. I almost never take naps, and I climbed into bed after doing nothing for hours and took a two hour nap because I didn't want to be awake. Some days I think I am getting better, that I can make better habits and get myself out of this crutch. Then I just get hit like a goddamn bus with all these negative thoughts out of nowhere and I'm back to square one. It's so disheartening, it feels like I'm trying to swim through tar towards some land that is miles and miles away. I know people care about me, but it doesn't feel like it. I know I have friends and people I can call on when I need them, but I feel so alone. Depression is so hard..I hope it does get better eventually...I just need to hang on to that hope..",5

"I have 0 friends. I'm getting bad marks in school and I'm garbage at my major. Never had a girlfriend and I have terrible anxiety that inhibits me from everything. I don't have the balls to approach a girl or even ask a question in class. And the final blow is that I'm literally broke and have to work on the weekends to keep ~150 bucks in my account which just puts me further behind in school. 

I'm just so tired of everything. Tired of doing everything alone, having no one to talk. Tired of constant school work or shitty part-time job work. I resent my dad and dislike my step mom.

I feel like I've tried so hard to improve my life, going to the gym, meditating, cold showers, but it's gotten me nowhere. I don't want to try anymore. I just want to die. This life is not for me. Thank you if you read this",4
I can't do anything right. I have a friend who can do what I can and she can do it better and can do more. I know you shouldn't compare yourself but I don't care! I'm DONE byeeee!,1
"I think about suicide most days. When I visit my 92yr old grandmother in her care home I wish I could be there, waiting to die - how peaceful it must be to know you will be released from all this suffering very soon? 

I consider myself a spiritual person and have been heavily into yoga, meditation and psychedelics and learnt about Buddhist philosophy which is what has formed my beliefs about death. Most people find this a healing path but for me the transcendental experiences I have had have felt like such a homecoming that I haven't wanted to return to reality. I have never felt at home in myself and often feel like I desperately want to â€œget out of my bodyâ€ in which I feel trapped. I have always felt I was born into the wrong body/life. I've also believed from a young age that I will die from suicide or a reckless accident. I unsuccessfully attempted age 25 and have had some other near misses. 

The thing I am struggling with is I believe that if I kill myself my soul will return back to the source but I am worried it will be turned around and put right back into another life of equal amount of suffering to mine as my soul won't have evolved at all. I don't think I can escape it unless I evolve by overcoming my struggles. I've had an eating disorder for 17yrs, as well as BPD and Bipolar. I guess this is the cycle of Samsara and the continual dukkha/suffering which is part of the human condition. 

When I think about this it makes me feel trapped and is going some way to put me off the idea of suicide, but at the same time I feel like I've exhausted my energy to try and overcome it all in this life - I'm exhausted in my battle against this ED, it feels completely hopeless. Perhaps if reincarnation does happen at least I could try overcoming some other set of struggles? 
Hoping reincarnation is not a thing and our souls return to the source and don't have to come back here again for more of this bullshit!",3
I fell into a deep dark place 6 months ago and haven't made much progress. The only thing holding me together is meds. So how do you make your days more bearable?,5
"Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything.

I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy. I'd just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice? Psychiatrists and therapists always feel so removed from the reality (for me, anyway) - I'd just like to hear from people who know what's like and have helped themselves.",3
"I have made small effort in trying to fix my self esteem, but it's so hard and it feels impossible because I believe all my negative thoughts. I think I'm ugly, huge, boring, and unfunny person. I put up a good front when I talk to people that I don't even think anyone knows how much I just want to stop living. I haven't made any suicide attempts, but some nights I start thinking about how lonely I am. No one in high school liked me very much, lots of rumors would be spread about me. So after I graduated I didn't keep many friends. I get it though, I'm boring. I don't even daydream anymore about me living in a better mental state, surrounded by fun loving people. I thought it was stupid for me to live inside my head, so I stopped. But that was one of the things that would help me fall asleep better. I used to be a hopeless romantic but now I am convinced no one will ever love me. I don't have crushes anymore because thinking about relationships sucks because I always put myself under a microscope and find everything wrong about me. I am alone, I can't even bring up conservations about my mental health to my mom because she thinks I'm doing it for attention. I subconsciously probably am. I just don't want to be here anymore, why did I have to be born. If I was really depressed I would have killed myself already, I don't know why I feel like this. I don't think I'll get better it's been this way for almost 3 years. It's so unfortunate that I exist and can't disappear from peoples minds. Have any of you seen eternal sunshine for the spotless mind? You know how you can be erased from someone's memory in that movie? If that were real I would of erased my sisters memory and my aunts so they don't have to feel pain when I kill myself",1
"I've been suffering for years and just this November I decided to tell my parents and ask for help because I couldn't find a therapist on my own and wanted help. They listened, said a lot of â€œthe right thingsâ€ but near the end of the discussion they summed it up to stress and school and activities and tried to â€œfix my problemsâ€. They agreed to search for a therapist though and a couple days later even told me they found someone and were waiting on a call back. It's been about 4 months and there's been nothing. When I ask they only say they're waiting on a call back. I just want help. It's gotten progressively worse and worse. I've come here because I am in a place currently where I'm afraid I could go home and commit suicide. I just needed to rant, sorry if this doesn't fit the sub or the rules, I only scanned them.",0
"I had planned to kill myself tonight. I bought pills and had been just so ready to end it. I have just been feeling empty, hopeless and worthless lately. I'm just sick of feeling like this over and over again. But then my sister called, and she started talking about plans for when I come home in two weeks. She was so happy to talk to me and to get to spend 9 days with me, I just can't do that to her. I'd like that week to be a happy memory after I can do something but I want to be there for my spring break. So I didn't take anything or do anything. She doesn't even know what her calling did, I didn't want to tell her.",5
"I broke up with my bf about a year and a half ago, after being together 4 years. Throughout our relationship he was often depressed, angry at everything, narcissistic, extremely anxious, would go through phases of not eating, etc. I tried helping as much as I could and encouraging he get help (which he did a few times, on and off seeing a therapist) but it never worked.

I had to cut off our relationship because it just became ""too much"". He would blame me for his carelessness, would get annoyed if I offered help in any way, and was just constantly negative. I just often didn't feel loved, and without ranting his mental health issues were stressful as I tried and tried to help him and it felt useless.

When we broke up I didn't feel the need to block him but did not want to be ""friends"" or really ever have any communication any more. Since we broke up, he has texted me here and there that he's suicidal, hates everyone, screams at himself, has no reason to live, etc. He told me that since I broke up with him he would kill himself, but i took that more so as manipulation. I would text him trying to help, offering advice, and so on, which was mentally draining because any time I'd try and help he'd continue texting things like ""I'm just gonna kill myself"". I have told him so many times he needs professional help and by doing so will improve his mental health. 

He's nearly 30 and has barely held a job because he ""hates all the managers"" wherever he works and continuously drops out of school to sit at home and be handed money by his mom and play PS4 all day. When I encourage finding a different job or so on he gets offended and tells me I'm a ""slave"" because I have a full time job.

I've since entered a new relationship with someone I love very much. When my ex randomly occasionally texts me (he texts me probably once every 10-15 days) saying he wants to kill himself I panic and reply and try to help. I told my current bf about helping my ex and he was understandably upset. I know I need to stop communication with my ex but I worry by telling him we need to stop talking he actually will kill himself. I have told a close friend this and they told me if he doesn't want to accept help or seek any help, and kills himself, at least I tried and there was nothing more I could do. 

The other day at work I checked my phone and had a ton of missed texts from him saying he was going to kill himself &amp; that he has no reason to live anymore. All the texts made me panic terribly, I had to leave work because I started crying and ended up calling suicide prevention (they were beyond unhelpful) because I know he needs help. After 4 years of hearing him talk about being depressed, and never accepting help and then breaking up and still hearing it through text and STILL trying to get him to see a professional and get help I am honestly burned out and mentally drained. I don't know what else I can do at this point besides telling him, for the last time, he needs help and due to me being in a new relationship we need to stop talking and I wish him the best.",4
"Life is hard. I failing one of my classes(chem). I'm really stresses out. I have depression, for the past few years. I feel like killing myself each because I'm not good enough for my parents. My sibling all have amazing jobs and great singing voices. And I just feel like I'm the one home and depressed holding my parents down. I feel like it would be easier to go instead of me being here in pain, and spreading that pain to others.",2
"I'm not one to reach out to strangers for help but something is wrong with me. I've felt empty for a long time now but I always contributed that to a lack of motivation.

I fill this void so to speak with temporary pleasures like women, sex, working out regularly, and winning in games but they're all just distractions

Today I woke up and I was just sad and I don't even know why. I'm usually able to hold such feelings back but I woke up at 3am in the morning after going to bed a almost 1am. I was absurdly hungry and made some eggs and I just started crying. I just sat there eating these damn eggs with tears streaming down my face. There wasn't even anything wrong, I shouldn't be sad and yet I feel lower than I ever have. I've got a good family, plenty of friends, a job that is adequate for the time being, and I'm reasonably good looking to my knowledge but it's never enough. No matter how much I improve physically, no matter how much I win at DBFZ, no matter how many woman say I'm hot at the end of the day I still just feel empty.
Now I'm not here claiming to be depressed without even seeing a doctor but I don't like this. It seems like the only time I'm happy is when I'm in a relationship, but needing to constantly use a girl as a crutch to justify my existence isn't much better than being miserable by myself. I don't even enjoy life anymore I'm just going through the motions because I have to.

I don't know what to do and it frustrates me. I'm by no means suicidal but I'm tired of feeling tired. Every morning I wake up after 3 or 4 hours of sleep and lay there doing nothing. I feel useless and undesirable, I go on tinder and maybe I'll have a match or two but they just bore me with their monotonous bios and questions. It's not like I'm on there being toxic I do my best to make conversation but the thoughtless, close ended responses these girls send me annoy me and I just drop them.

I just want to feel content but I'm not even sure if I remember how. I know I'm not the only one who's ever felt this way. what did you guys/girls do to fill this hole I guess.",5
"Turning 31 on Friday. Every year since I was maybe 12 or 13 I have felt this way. Once in awhile I want to see friends, party, indulge. But that lasts for mere minutes. Then the doom and gloom sets in and all I think about is really sticking it to everyone and offing myself on my birthday. I feel like I only stay alive so no one's ""feelings get hurt"" 

I'm at a point now not only am I just drowning in self loathing...I literally live to pay bills and make sure everyone is happy. 

I can no longer financially, mentally or physically afford to stay alive. If I do it. I want to write a really really mean note to make sure everyone just stays mad and is glad I'm dead. I want to spill everyone's secrets and turn everyone against one another. They wont miss me. They'll be too wrapped up embarrassed by their own actions that I'll unveil. 

I'm sad. I'm angry. I hate myself and everything...except my dog. I'm pathetic and I suck and I just want it all to be over.",1
"Been put back on antidepressants to help me with anxiety and depression. Also, short term benzo. Nothing is going right in life at the moment. And I've taken to hurting myself in anyway as much as possible.

I have no control and alone in this, no one that actually wants to walk with me through this... Which, is the norm.

And, I've done what I always do, which is cut everyone off, delete/deactivate everything, go to work with a mask on every day, crying myself to sleep every single night.

Guess, knowing that I'm actually getting up and going to work is a good thing. As last time I just let everything go. I'm not as deep as I was back then, but I am still sinking right now.

"I've always had issues with dissociation, but since I started taking meds for my depression it just seems to be a constant thing. I hate it, I feel like I'm not even human anymore. I feel more like a robot. Everybody says they've seen such a difference in me since I started taking them, but I'm not feeling better. I'm not feeling anything. Which is scarier than feeling depressed, because it was the emptiness that drove me to start self harming years ago and I desperately do not want to go back to that place. I feel like medication is pushing me backwards. I know it. can take many attempts to find the right medication, but I've tried three different ones so far and every one is the same. They all make me feel like this and it's driving me insane. I just want to be able to feel like a normal human being, instead of having a choice between â€œmiserableâ€ and â€œemptyâ€. Both make me feel like I'd be better off dead, so it's not exactly helping :/",5

I tried to break the cycle but I'm in a downward spiral.",2
"Howdy. I don't know why I'm posting like it's going to do anything for me but whatever. This is gonna be pretty wordy. A fella out here fighting the long fight. Everything's shit. Everything's been shit since I was like 11. There hasn't been a day in at least 5-6 years that suicide hasn't crossed my mind. I've managed to stay pretty functional. Less so now. I can't do anything. I'm used to having bad days. I'm used to that. But for the longest time my bad days were maximum 17 hours in bed then I get up to piss or something. It's different now. My bad days are 31 hours in bed no food or water. I don't go online, I don't talk to anyone, I just sulk. Everything's gone to shit. 

My family is big against any sort of therapy/mental illness sort of talk. I was too. Last year in August I broke down and started therapy because I knew I was slacking. I decided If not to change my mood, then to at least change my behavior. It helped for a while. Cut to December. I'm off my shit. I break down again and resort to meds. I've always been against meds for myself so idk maybe that adds some perspective. I felt like meds were the equivalent of me giving up my personality, becoming the masses. Pretentious I know but whatever. Meds don't do shit. I've had so many appointments with my psychiatrist to change my meds or the dosage but nothing has worked and it's been too long. 

I decided to go into an outpatient program in February. Things were really bad. I started disassociating very intensely. I can't feel my body move, I can't control my motions. It's one of the most terrifying things I've ever experienced. I went through the application process and got accepted into outpatient care. I was finally going to get thorough help. Confidentiality had been broken, relationships irreparable but I was going to do what I needed to do. The day I start I find out my insurance doesn't cover it.

I am so fucking tired of being too poor. I'm tired. It's so fucking humiliating to not be able to take care of yourself because you can't afford it. When I grew up everyone thought I was gonna be the kid to escape this shit. To break the cycle and actually make something of myself and be content. I was smart, I was bilingual and inventive and passionate and I learned about how to best fight my circumstances. I really thought I had a chance. But I don't.

There's no escaping the cycle of poverty. It comes back to bite no matter what you do. My grades suffered because I didn't have a computer, or internet, or because I was losing my apartment or whatever the crisis might've been at the time. My grades are shit now, like a 1. something gpa. I can't get a scholarship and to be totally fucking honest I'm not sure I'd even graduate high school. I'm a financial drain on all my guardians. My mom won't buy me food, my dad is trying to not lose his other kid, and my grandma (who raised me) is forced to live with my dad and pay off the house because he can't afford it and knew he could leech off of her. I can't work because I'm already failing all my classes and I'm supposed to fix that.

The worst part is being aware of my situation. I can't afford to be healthy. I can't afford to be educated. I can't afford to be happy. How fucked up is that? I don't try and paint myself as the victim of this dumb ass capitalist society but come ON. It doesn't matter how I play the game. It doesn't matter how hard I try and be better. I can't pay for it. If I keep going, then in 10 years I'm gonna be a deadbeat working three jobs in some toxic relationship just like every other adult in my life. 

I can't have a life. I can't pay for it. If I kill myself that's like max a $7000 funeral. I have about a thousand and my family probably wouldn't spend that much anyway. Hell, if I can get rid of the body they won't even have to deal with that. No more food expenses, no more school expenses, no more health expenses. They can sell my shit, rent out my room, i don't care: I'll be fucking dead what do I need all this shit for? I can't keep up. Every time I turn a corner there's some new crisis to be dealt with. I can't keep doing this. Something has got to change and the only thing left to try is killing myself.",2
i cant tell genuinely. i think about it like every day now and i want it in a lot of ways but not really. i know that i'm not satisfied and i have this strong sense that i will never be. everyone around me is telling me i have no reason to feel the way i do. i don't know if i'm victimizing myself to get attention because i can't tell at this point. everyday i'm just floating and not really paying attention and not really living. i don't really ever plan anything but i think about it a lot. i think about the ways i'd do it and what the people around me would think. it just feels like there isn't much for me here and that it's best to rest forever. i'm just always tired now. so i can't tell,5

"Warning: this is VERY long. I'm not sure what the purpose of it really is but just wanting to put this out there in the world. Maybe I'll get some advice, maybe someone will read it and realize they are not alone.

I've started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through. This is yet another attempt, let's see what happens.

I'm a 30 year old woman, I work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in Graphic Design, volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week, and suffer from depression and social/general anxiety disorder.

I first realized my teen angst wasn't just a â€œphaseâ€ sometime in my early 20's. As a teenager I would do the normal things: drink, do drugs, smoke weed. I would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. I've since lost that precious notebook, but I did come upon snippets of that â€œpoetryâ€ in my other sketchbooks. The stuff wasn't anything out of the ordinary - I grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music - and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. I lost interest in that activity around the age of 20.

I was always a shy person. I played with friends during school, but I was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone's house. As a result, I was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. My parents brought me to Canada when I was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education. I was born in Russia where there wasn't much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. In that aspect, I thank them. I was able to attend an art school in Toronto and attain my Graphic Design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates.

When I arrived in Canada I didn't speak much English and was in an ESL program. In that first year, 4th grade, I was bullied for not speaking the language. Some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks (the little pebbles from the playground) down my pants while we had â€œcarpet timeâ€ (when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson.) They knew I wouldn't say anything, partly because I couldn't physically, partly because I couldn't mentally. Kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. I brushed it off, went on with it. I did have two great friends (one of which is still in my life albeit we aren't close.)

This childish bullying subsided after the first year. I went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents. 6th grade was split. It was yet another school (moving from elementary to middle school) and then half way through 6th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, I was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. I had to start over with the friend thing and luckily I befriended a girl right away. She was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didn't fit in with the â€œcool popular kids.â€ Here I was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having 1 friend, and being so extremely shy. After a while I became close with another girl, let's call her Jessica. 7th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. I was also developing extremely bad acne, so I was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years.

Ending of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with Jessica. She had an â€œinâ€ with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, I got to hang out with the group occasionally. This is where we started â€œrelationshipsâ€ with two boys. She was with lets call him Andrew and I was with let's call him Mike. We would hang out after school a lot and one day I brought them all over to my house. Mike took me down to my parent's cellar at one point and where I thought I would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. I didn't know how to retaliate so I went with it. Instead of a first kiss, I gave my first hand job. The next time we hung out was at the movies. I was brought to the bathroom for what I thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. I can't remember whether I went through with it, I just remember crying that evening. I soon found out that Andrew and Mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and Jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. These things bled into high school. The rumours started that I was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school. The photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that Jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun â€œfashionâ€ night. She wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got distributed. 

Finally a new girl came to the school lets call her Beth and finally things seemed to calm down. We had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school (to the point where people were calling us lesbians.) I even attended her wedding two years ago, she's a beautiful human being. I tried my best to have a normal life. I threw myself into art. I would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. I got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. Of course throughout this time I did the regular teenage girl stuff. I liked boys, I would make out with them. I was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. I just did it. It made them happy. And in my mind, that made me good at it. Why not do the thing that I felt I excelled at? Of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. 

I first tried drugs in 10th grade. Beth and I would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. This went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. I'm not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but I managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. At the end of 12th grade I met lets call him Sam. We dated for 2 years, I lost my virginity to him, but I will always remember doubting his intentions. Did he stay with me for the sex? Did he only want me around because I would smoke weed with him? It didn't matter. I lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit I just didn't want to, or couldn't break.

I got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. After my break up with Sam, I met lets call him Dale. It was interesting at first. He would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. He brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. I now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. He wouldn't take no for an answer even if I didn't really feel like doing anything. The thing with Dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. We were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. I was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. As you well know by now, I have trouble saying no. So we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. (I know how shameful it is to drink and I drive. I know first hand because I almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. I haven't done it since and will never do it again.) We were in the car and I was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. But he wouldn't stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. I did it just to make him shut up so I could go home. I haven't seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. 

The truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when I began to frequent parties. At first it was drinking, and a lot of it. Then I met a 28 year old man lets call him Izack. He was a DJ and very much into the rave party scene. It was with him when I tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24. Lets just call the rest a blur. I would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. Long story short, I just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor's heart. I loved Izack. He was older, had more experience, best sex I've ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. He lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. The sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. I would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict Russian parents. Then Izack started going on the road a lot more due to his DJ career flourishing. When he was away, I would come to his place and clean everything. I bought him a huge new TV for his room. I wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. In my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. 

About a year into our relationship, I went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that I have an STD. They told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. It was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but I had to have a serious conversation with Izack. He swore on his life that he never cheated on me. He begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, I finally did. But I never got over the nagging feeling that something wasn't right. So after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday (I remember that day so clearly), I asked him one more time. I'm not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how I contracted the STD.

I was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. The drugs and alcohol increased. I went on Tinder and began my first sex binge. At one point I managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week. All I wanted to do was to forget the hurt and I didn't know how. Again, all of this is very blurry so I can't say the exact moment that Izack came back into my life but he did. I remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say I forgive him and that I'm moving on. That meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. We then got â€œback togetherâ€, continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. I let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. I think this is where I learned how to numb my brain from hurt. I wasn't mad at him anymore, I just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on Tinder. After a few months of this, I met a guy lets call him Jon. 

We dated for something close to a year. This relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. But at this point I didn't want another life. The relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. For example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. I was told I was crazy on an almost daily basis. I will fast forward to the end, where a girl (who is now a friend) reached out to me saying that she was also dating Jon, for 6 months now. She spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. Apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. It turns out, that we weren't the only ones. I came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me. This included his upstairs neighbour who I was constantly told not to worry about. 

I laughed at this. I didn't cry, I didn't feel angry, I laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next Tinder binge I went.

It took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship. This one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. It lasted for about 2 years. I met his parents and he met mine. We were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. We just weren't right for each other.

So this is where I am now. 30 years old, living back with my parents. I have since stopped the partying because that life doesn't satisfy me anymore and my body can't handle it. I have been coke free for about a year now mainly because I can't afford it. But I drink. I drink several times a week because I can't stand my job. I drink because I feel trapped in my own mind. I drink because of my living situation. I drink because nothing I do excites me. I drink about 3 times a week and once I crack a bottle of wine, there is no way I can stop. That bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until I pass out. 

The job thing - realized I'm the only one who can help myself there so I have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isn't an option. I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can't stay excited and motivated. 

Last night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn't find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn't show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don't know if I want to stop. I've had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I've cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I'm not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don't have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I'm finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. 

I would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word â€œIâ€ is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won't lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn't felt the pull of it.

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully, attempted to read it, or even glanced at it. I am very scared and for some reason the only thing I thought of this morning was writing this.",3
"I'm either gonna kill myself then or cut my wrists bad enough I have to be admitted.

Everyone hates me and they've began to stop hiding it. I know it'd relieve everyone if I just died. Only question is, how should I do it?

"I am in my early 30s, transgender MtF and my life is in ruins. I have no friends and I don't mean that figuratively, I mean it in a literal sense. Nobody cares about me. I used to have a decent life until some bad decisions and mistakes. I've never taken drugs or been addicted to anything (not that it matters) just trusted some of the wrong people including my parents. 


About four years ago, I moved back home to be with my sick mother. In doing so, I fucked myself over. She died about a year later and I became stuck in the middle of nowhere with no transportation and now surviving off of the 'generosity' of some very religious family. I am living alone in a small mobile home on my family's property. I am unable to have guests. I am unable to find work because I don't have transportation and other reasons. I have severe depression and social anxiety. I have mild OCD. I haven't been able to be on hormones for the past 4 years. I am not myself. 


Please forgive the rambling nature of this post. I'm just typing as it comes to my head. I have no future. I have no viable possibility of getting out of this and starting my life over. I live in a mobile home infested with bed bugs. I've slept on the floor for four years without even changing my sheets or blankets. I haven't had laundry detergent in four years. I wash my underwear in the bathtub. The heater has been messed up all winter so I've been freezing. I have one blanket and one sheet. No pillows after they got infested with bed bugs. 


All I've eaten for the past three years are potatoes, macaroni and cheese and balogne sandwiches. I haven't been able to even leave the house in 3 years and the last time was for my moms funeral. I can't even shave my face or legs because I haven't had razers, shaving cream or anything in three years. I haven't had face wash. I've had the same bottle of shampoo for three years. I've had four bars of soap for the past three years... My kitchen sink doesn't work, I wash my one plastic bowl in the bathroom sink. I don't speak to anyone. I'm essentially already dead. Although I doubt I get 2000 calories a day, the type of foods I've eat have made me gain at least 30 pounds and so none of my clothes fit me. I have one pair of stretchy pajama pants and two tshirts that fit me. It could be worse, i could be homeless so I've kept this inside for this long but I'm tired. My life is really already over. I'm exhausted. After this month, I won't have internet and I am fairly certain with nothing to do at all, no music etc, I will go insane. So I've made peace with my fate and I guess this is the last month of my life. I don't remember what happiness is. I can't even think of anything that could change my life at this point. There isn't even a dream. There just isn't a point to go on at this point. 


I feel like a failure. I feel sad and hurt. I found one of my mom's journals recently, she mentions she was raped by her father when she was a kid. So that is the energy surrounding me. I'm stuck here, isolated and treated like an animal basically. If I were to die, nobody would care or probably even notice. So thats it. I can't think of anything else to say. But I needed to get it off my chest. Thank you.",1
"let me start off by saying that I hate my best friend sometimes not all the time. The basic reason is because she's so perfect and I feel like such a waste and piece of shit when I see her. I'm 16 and a sophomore in high school. We met last year as freshmen and I had never had any friends before so I immediately just accepted her. She was 13 when we met so she started kindergarten early and skipped a grade. then there's me who's two years older but nothing compared to her. She gets straight A's, takes all AP and honors classes, made VARSITY softball as a freshman (age of a 7th grader), got the lead roles in all the theatre shows, and just has a perfect life. 

Then there's me who doesn't have the best home life. I've tried telling her I can't sleep over because I need my meds and for other reasons. But then she just tells me ""oh everyone feels sad sometimes. You don't need those stupid pills."" Or if I tell her that it's my anxiety and ADHD pills she is like ""everyone has some form of ADHD. Have you seen everyone who can't pay attention? Those pills don't do anything""

I'm very reluctant to end our friendship because I don't have any other friends. Also my Mom has gotten really close with their family and I can't end the friendship beacuse that would be awkward. I feel like this is toxic though. Idk maybe it's just cause I'm not good enough I feel like shit.",3
"Trans girl, 17 years old. I've sat on my ass and done practically nothing for the past 2 years, got withdrawn at 15 from school due to mom worried that I'd get bullied for being trans, tried homeschooling but fell out of it. I always said that I'm not a true drop-out because I plan on getting into college at some point, but right now I don't even know if that's possible. 

My body is worthless, 6 feet tall and 130 lbs, nobody wants to date a skeleton, and if they do, maybe there is something wrong with them... I can get skinny people, but ones who are bony to the point of concern... I can't get why anyone would be attracted to me. Yet I somehow have a boyfriend. 

My jawline and brow ridge make me look like a fucking Neanderthal, and yet I've been told that I'd pass fine with estrogen, they're all just being nice. They know the crushing, suicidal feeling it is if you're ever told that you can't pass, and they simply don't want me to get pushed over the edge and end it, they're only being nice. 

Haven't gotten a job, haven't even gotten a license, and haven't done anything school related much either. I just sit on my ass and play video games, watch youtube, anime, listen to music, I just do my hobbies, I think about getting off my ass and getting my life back on track but the lack of motivation I have is weighing me down like an anvil tied to my ankles. I just feel no need to...

I'm a joke, and one with a mediocre punchline too. Somebody respectable would have done SOMETHING by now, I've been emotionally biasd by my stepfather for a few years but I got over it, so I really can't use that reason or excuse. I could have had a job, had a license and be in college right now, but I can't. Because I lack any motivation, because I don't want my license to say ""male"" or my dead name, because I don't want to be discriminated or humiliated at any public workplaces for being trans, maybe if I wasn't such a lazy pussy, I could have gotten somewhere. 

But nah, I haven't, and it's all because of laziness, lack of motivation, and fear. 6 months to recover? Fair enough, a year? Maybe if it's that serious, but 2 years? Sigh... If there is one word anyone can describe me as, it would be; a failure.

I'm sorry that I let everyone down, and I'm sorry that I've disappointed you...",1

For context purposes, I'm an accountant and have been one for almost a decade now. I was the kid who studied his butt off in school with the expectation that would pay off in the form of a good job, success etc. I was also one of those people that thought he was better than others, where deep down I wasn't. Really, everybody is special and unique in their own ways. Anyways, what I'm getting at is I feel I've put a lot of bad energy out there and it's all culminating into one big disaster over the past few months. That disaster being the realization that the skills that I say I have on paper I don't actually have in real life (somehow miraculously I got by the past 10 years) and now I don't know what to do. Over the past few months I haven't been sleeping, barely getting anything done at work and overall feel like the end is near. I've had suicide ideation since I was a 15 coupled with worrying about death in general. Anyways, not sure what I expect to get out of posting this, but just wanted to share my situation. I do want to live deep down, there are just so many uncertainties and realizations about myself that scare the living shit out of me.",5

I living in a third world country where people better working their ass off to feed their mouth than thinking for their own feelings. I was born in a urban family and have got a lot of traumas and hatreds duo to unfortunate childhood but I was strived to have a decent education and have tough myself a lot about psychology. Recently I've aware of my depression being more serious cause I started develop and think about suicidal thoughts more often. I told my parents that have trouble in my brain and it affected my study but nobody cares and said I was crazy wtf?? So I decided to tell my aunt who is a physician that I got trouble in my brain but she disappointed me by saying you should stop overthinking and prepare for your future??? Am so messed up right now fuck fuck fuck.,4
I've reached this point in my life that I don't want to die anymore. I need to die. I want to believe it gets better like so many people say. I want to find that magical medication that people claim makes them feel better. I'm holding on in the hope that maybe it's true but I don't know how much longer I can hold on.,0
"I want to die simple as that. I don't want to do this anymore. My life has been a fucking shit show since I was 5. People are only in my life because I help them. I'm that person who will give you the fucking shirt off my back. Do I have anyone in my life who would do that for me? No

Right now I'm practically waiting for my nonverbal 3 year old who has autism to finally say she loves me and then I'll check out. That's the only thing I'm living for. 

When I told people that they called me selfish. â€œPeople love youâ€ â€œthink about your kidsâ€ â€œif you do it I'll never visit your graveâ€. Why would it take for me to die for people to start showing love for me? Honestly my kid will be better off without me. They don't deserve to have such a fucked up mom. And I'm not being buried. I want to be cremated and thrown away. So I don't really need visitors. 

I SHOULD WANT TO DIE WHEN IM READY AND IM FUCKING READY",3
"Dear Reddit, 

Hello everyone here :) 
I'm a 16 year old female. I'm not feeling too well right now. I'm getting these thoughts and suicidal feeling again. They come back occasionally. Right now, I'm eating with my beautiful mother, laughing with my dad as he says my mother is a wonderful cook. I broke down last night when I finished reviewing and studying from my classes. I studied hard for a test I had today, and I felt good about it! Right now, I'm eating as I type this. This day? I thought it would be bad, but it was okay, turning to bad. I'm In a relationship. I love this boy so much. I've been happiest with him since years ago. Im a sophomore in high school by the way. I've trusted my boyfriend so much and he's always been there for me. Today however, I felt something was wrong. He didn't really speak with me. But it's okay, I'm probably just overthinking it, I want nothing but pure happiness for him. Whether he finds it with someone else or me. I've always helped others, always had a smile on my face and I've always wanted nothing but happiness for everyone. I've only want happiness for everyone else. I want them to feel good and appreciated by atleast someone when they do something. I've always supported through anything and I've never judged. I've been kind to everyone. I appreciate everything that's given to me, but it's been a few months I've been feeling these usual suicide thoughts. They come often. It's been a year since I've been like this, trying to hang on and move on from it. Whether I see happy moments, times where I love this view. Or others where I'm not sure how I'm feeling.

I felt pressured by my mother. Verbally. I hate trying so hard at school, and failing. What's the point? I'm going to fail anyways. I've always done my best in everything and I've always tried to stay happy and look the positive way. But I can't anymore. I've always thought, what if I can just end it? Would anyone really miss me? I think about it, imagining my parents. But, would I really make a difference? Will I go to hell? Religiously talking, I love god. But I'm sorry, I feel like I've lost faith in myself. I don't see it anymore. And every night, I pray, to have a good day, to see my parents, my friends. To stay safe. I want to die, but I don't. But I want to attempt, but I'm afraid. What if I fail? Would my family be ashamed? 

I think about it daily, and I feel like the only reason I'm
here is for my love. To be there for him when he needs company, to be there for him when he can't find the light, to be with him when he can't be happy. To support him through the good and bad. No matter what, no matter the past. For my dad, who's worked really hard every single night for me and my family. For my friend, who needs support from his friends and family. For my dog, who always listened to me when I felt alone, knowing he wouldn't understand, but knows I'm upset and let's me cry on him when I don't have anyone else. 

I don't know, I feel like tonight could be it. But I don't want too I just wonder, would it even matter?",4
"Hello all, 

Using a throwaway account, but I frequent this sub on my main account. Anyway, I need some advice. I can't trust my girlfriend when I'm depressed. The both of us deal with anxiety and depression, but she doesnt seem to get me when I'm depressed. Don't get me wrong, we both have our faults, but we always do our best to understand each other and walk through hard times with one another. However, the last two times that I have been very depressed, she ended up pushing me away when I needed her the most. About a month ago she got very upset with me that she walked over to me and angrily accused me of not showing enough attention to our relationship. I had a family member pass just a few weeks before, and I think it was finally getting to me. I apologized, told her that I'm depressed, saying that I wish I could be doing better. I told her that I was depressed and she walked away, angry, slamming the door behind her. The person that I love the most turned her back on me when I needed her the most. I went for a walk, we messaged each other, and she asked me to come back. She was crying so much, I felt bad. She felt terrible for not listening to me. This wasn't the first time that something like this has happened though. When I am depressed, she pushes me away. Besides this, my girlfriend is incredibly loving, thoughtful, creative in our relationship, and sacrifices so much for us. But this, this hurts so fucking bad. 

Reddit, have you experienced something similar? Where do you turn when you're depressed? Have you talked to your SO about this and have you fixed it? 

tl;dr My very loving girlfriend pushes me away when I'm depressed, don't know what to do or where to go when I'm feeling like this.",4

"I'm 30yr male, living alone, unemployed, broke, alone, and the only thing that get me going is my dream to become a filmmaker, but that dream now starting to fall apart.

Filmmaking has been literally the thing that shape who i am today. I've been doing videography and editing stuff for almost 10 years, beside doing my passion project, i also earn a living by edit and produce video for small businesses. Overtime I learned alot about the entertainment industry, but i never part of them. Instead i just do my freelance work, but i do have a dream, to make a feature film. Knowing my own lacking, i study and research as much as i could about independent film and unfortunately in my country, indie scene is basically non existent. I decided to fund my own film, because nobody wants to finance a stranger like me. 

Earlier this year, I thought this year will be the year I finally made it. I sold my car and use my saving to fund a film project which i hope can be the one that gets people attention. As i slowly developing the project, i met several industry folks, with the intention of gaining knowledge and get some support, but instead all i got is them dismissed and laughed at my project because I'm a fool to even dream about making a film with my budget, and more importantly, I'm nobody. I was treated nonchalantly. Hate to say this, but i do agree on some of the points they gave.

Now I'm aware, even if i did make the film, the chances for it to actually help me further my career is slim. I love doing this, and i would love to make a living with this, but moneys are tight, the thought of giving up the only thing i passionate the most in my life, kills me.

Today, I'm just laying hopelessly typing this crap on my phone. I lost all the passion, and motivation to keep going. I'm tired of seeing people, i spent my days at home alone. I'm embarrassed with my friends and family, especially my mom, who has been nothing but supportive.

I'm contemplating if i should let go of this dream and looking for a new job at 30yr.",2

"Lately I have been getting unreasonably angry, thanks to some heavily biased content online, and I have been taking it out by posting things here that neither meet this sub's guidelines nor are community friendly. I would like to apologize, and state that I will no longer post to this sub. Thank you for your patience.",0
"I've been posting here a lot recently, but it's better then bothering my friends which is why I have. I feel bad because it probably seems like I am searching for some kind of attention, but I'm not I'm just so depressed and done with everything that I have no where else to turn. I used to text those crisis hotlines, but they never help anymore. They're all trained to recite the same things, and it's aggravating having the same conversation over and over again where it doesn't really feel like my feelings are really being validated. 

Everyone goes through things. I know that as much as the next person. The world is a cruel yet charming place filled with a mixture of amazing people and people who couldn't give two shits about others. I hate how complicated the world is, and I hate how the good things people do never seems to lessen the bad things. I have turned into such a cynical person and as time goes on I've found it harder and harder to see good in the world past some amazing friends and the unconditional love that animals provide. After someone killed my beloved dog though, everything just feels bleak again. He didn't deserve the death he got, and it angers me that nobody even wants to put in the time to find out who would have done this to my best friend. â€œIt won't bring him backâ€, you're right. It won't, but maybe it would settle this raging anger I have inside? Maybe it would help me feel less guilty about the fact I wasn't there for him because I was too busy fucking around in college? He gave me everything, and I gave him loneliness while someone brutally murdered him. 

I can never understand why I feel this way, and why everything in my life is going to shit. I'm so very tired and done with the world. When my mom died March 2019, I thought that was what finally broke me, but then I started to get better. I went to counseling, I leaned on my friends, and I started to cope better. I honestly thought that everything was finally looking up, but the world likes to put people like me back in their place. The more I think about it, the more I consider the fact that I'm probably meant for misery and this is why the world constantly kicks me back down when I start to get back on my feet. Coming home for spring break was a mistake as well. My father has done nothing but make me feel worse inside, and I have done nothing but be a recluse in my room watching Netflix. I have started to draw away from my support system too, not because they've done anything wrong but because I am tired of bothering them and they all have their own things going on in life without me coming around to be the depressed sack of shit that I am. 

I wish I hadn't failed my suicide attempts in the past. I wish I was selfish, naive, and brave enough to try again. I wish I didn't feel these things inside. Everyone would probably be better off without me anyway. My mom would be alive, my sweet baby would be alive, because I guarantee it was karma towards me that took them away. Karma for being a shit person.",1

"When I'm at work, I talk, laugh, and hide behind my shield. When I'm with family, I'm a little more vulnerable, but I'm mostly still silent about the things that are working hard against me to bring me down. However, when I'm alone...that's when it hits me. When my kids aren't home and I'm left to my own devices, that's when I'm the most afraid. It's not that I don't think anyone would miss me, it's the fact that I don't honestly care if they would or wouldn't. I feel like if they knew the extreme pain and mental anguish I'm in from the events my life has drug me through, they would understand my want for release. The constant cheating of exes, the constant deception and pain from being tossed away over and over again. The uselessness I feel of getting out of bed because the same vicious cycle awaits me every single day of my life! I'm tired. I'm tired of giving myself to others, putting myself out there and making myself vulnerable, just to wash, rinse, and repeat a thousand times more. Is it time for me to go? Does it matter? I want to know if in death I will find release. I want to know if separation from this world allows me to find peace once again. One thing is sure, I am scared...but also...not.",5
"Hi there, I don't know if this will help you at all, but if it helps even one person, that's enough for me. A bit of back ground information, I am a 22 year old that has been suffering from severe depression for the past year, with suicidal thoughts everyday of every hour. I felt like I was already dead cause no one seemed to notice me and I was slowly wasting away from the inside out. I also began to hear voices that would constantly berate me and tell me to kill myself, and after this, I sought help from my GP and was put onto anti-depressants (Sertraline) which did absolutely nothing. They didn't make it worse, but they certainly didn't make it better.

I was then put onto another anti-depressant (Mirtazapine) which I started taking at the beginning of February 2020, which seemed to help. I had the energy to finally get out of bed, take a shower and leave the house. But a couple of weeks ago, I noticed that although I had the energy to get up and go about my daily life, I was still thinking about killing myself everyday, but this time it was different as I had the energy and motivation to actually come up with a detailed plan and go through with it; and this scared me so much as I have never felt an urge to kill myself as much as I have in the last couple of weeks. 

So yesterday, I had a lot to deal with. My partner has been very sick with an unknown illness for nearly a year, so his parents rushed him to hospital. I was an absolute mess as I have been really struggling to 
silence the suicidal thoughts, whilst also fulfilling my duty as a carer for my partner. I had a mental breakdown after they took him to the hospital as the voices wouldn't stop. I actually began shouting back at them, but after a few minutes sobbing on the bathroom floor, I became completely numb and decided to follow through with my plan. 

I grabbed my supplies, which involved a dog lead, but I had made sure to buy this one especially for this occasion as it perfectly fit around my neck and had a sturdy metal clip which I could attach to the banister which would hold my weight. I was ready to do it, I was ready to go, and I put the collar around my neck and began to push my neck down into the collar to cut off the blood supply to the main artery in my neck, I heard this would only take a minute or so to make me unconscious, and the whole time I was holding my dog close to my chest cause I was so scared, but I wanted to die so badly. As I could feel myself going, I stopped. And I don't know what stopped me, but part of me thought that it wasn't my time to go. So I ended up picking up the phone and calling someone, who managed to calm me down and helped me look at everything from a different perspective. 

I know a lot of people will say that it's selfish for feeling suicidal or committing suicide due to the hurt it would cause to family/friends etc but from what I felt yesterday, none of that mattered. I truly believed that I wanted to die, and if I hadn't have stopped myself when I had, I would probably be dead now. 

But this morning, my partner finally got an official diagnosis of what has been making him so ill. I am currently sat in the hospital waiting for him to come out of surgery, and I have been told by the doctors that he is going to live a very healthy, normal life after this operation. If I had have killed myself yesterday afternoon, I would never have gotten to find out that my partner was going to be okay. I would never get to marry him in April. I would never get to see him healthy and happy again. All of these things I would have never known if I was dead now. I can now look forward to being able to spend time with my partner who can now start to enjoy his life again, and I can try and enjoy mine as much as I can knowing that he will be around for a long time. 

What I'm trying to get at after my long ass story, is that if there is any sort of hope you can cling onto, whether thats a friend, a pet, something you've got planned in the near future, or even just the feeling of the sun on your skin. Anything to get you through each day. You never have know when your life could take a turn for the best, or if something amazing will happen; and all of these things you will never get to experience if you end it all now. I'm not here to say that you shouldn't do it, because at the end of the day, I'm just some stranger on the internet that you don't know. But what I do know is that things can always get better. Always. But you never know when; and you'll never know if you're not here.",5

"I really cannot do this anymore. It's like my suffering has spread onto those I love and I'm at a point where I can no longer put on a fake smile. I can no longer pretend that I'm okay because I'm not. I hate seeing my friends and family hurt for me and it breaks my heart seeing them feel so helpless.

My life is such a failure and I've already ruined it so much that there's literally no point in going on. I fall asleep crying every night because I realized that I'm the problem here and my existence only makes the lives of others worse. People keep telling me how much they love me and how much I have to live for and while that does mean something to me, it's not enough to make me want to live. With my existence, I hurt people and with my death, I'll hurt people, so what's the point? At least if I die eventually the hurt will begin to fade (or so I hope). I just want the people I love to live a life without worries or hurt and all I do is hurt them.

I have chronic pain that is awful the last few years, relationship problems that he won't work out with me because he chooses to be stubborn and stand offish. 


I don't know how much more of life I can handle without cracking and shattering. It's been mostly bias and loneliness with a few brief happy moments. I've inherited every crazy gene in the family on top of that. I don't know how much I can take. So I want to shave my head because that will help.. somehow, I don't know. 


I'm just struggling in general. I don't know how to cope anymore. Journaling helps for a few minutes. Crafting helps for a few minutes. Standing in the sun helps for a few minutes. I don't know how else to feel better because nothing feels better for long.

"I tried making progress on my thesis from a few weeks back but it has been so difficult, not just in a mental state. Ever since I got depression, I have the hardest time focusing on stuff. Even if I tried to focus on doing stuff I enjoy doing, I can't do it for long, my head gets dizzy. I can't read lines in a book without getting my vision blurry and end up forgetting which line I was supposed to read.

And I also have the hardest time to recall short term and long term memories. These days I would have lunch and half an hour later I would ask myself ""wait, did I eat lunch today ? or was it yesterday ? Do I need to eat again ?"". I can't tell which day of the week is it. I currently don't have the two things that are absolutely crucial for my productivity, which is concentration and memory. I try to bring myself up but it is so freaking hard when my body can't respond back.

I guess now I just have to do what I can and try to brace myself for tomorrow, for I am sure to be destroyed during my defense tomorrow. I am scared sh\*tless because I know one of the professors can be ruthless and heartless, can only imagine how heartbreaking it will be tomorrow. I want to pat myself on the back and say ""Its okay, its gonna be fine. You've done your best against all odds.

"This is going to be a long post because i have a lot to say, sorry in advance.

I dont see any way my life can get on track, I'm 23 years old, i have achieved nothing noteworthy in life and i've generally lived a life of isolation, this stems all the way back from secondary school where i was relentlessly bullied for being black and overweight, i was only 11 years old when i first got diagnosed with depression because of the sheltered life i had lived before then meant i had no idea what people would be like once i got to high school, no one told me that being black was something that people may not like, no one told me that being overweight would be something kids would make fun of, but it happened, for 4 years straight, throughout high school i ran into various obstacles i'd never want a kid to go through, almost weekly fights, bad report cards and parents evenings lead to detentions and 3 day exclusions which lead to me starting to simply skip school and not go, i tried so hard to get myself kicked out of that school because my mother would not take me out of the school, i didnt understand why then and i still dont understand now and i think part of me resents her for that to this day, i truly believe my life could have been so different if i didnt get forced to stay at the school that almost killed me multiple times. 

The bullying definitely subsided a touch in the last year, with kids wanting to get into good 6th forms they started looking to just finishing their exams i guess? But the damage was already done, i started school a pretty normal happy kid with a fair few friends who didnt think about much besides what pokemon i needed to catch to fill my national dex or if i the cartoon i wanted to watch was recorded but by my last year i was could barely be bothered to do anything, i didnt talk to anyone i simply went to school and got the bus home and avoided people at all costs, i had skipped way too much school to get good grades and i could motivate myself to want to study, i was getting the bare minimum to get into 6th form and hopefully that was enough to scrape by. But as if things wern't bad enough i went on a residential school trip with one of my classes that was cut short because I ended up having a severe athsma attack when we got the the accommodation camp, this was my first time having an athsma attack and my first time i'd have ever been to hospital and i was only 15 so my first feelings were obviously of extreme panic, a small part of me i'd say was honestly relieved, maybe this was the end and i wouldnt have to go on, the ambulance got there and i must have asked the responded a hundred times if i was going to die, obviously she cant tell a child 'probably' so she said no and was comforting me, the ride to the hospital felt like an eternity. To wrap this part up obviously i didnt die but i had woken up a week later in the icu surrounded by my family, it was weird seeing my dad and mum together as well as their partners because they had been split up for a long time but i was just happy i woke up i guess. I had to stay in hospital for a few days more after i woke up for tests and rehab, getting used to walking again after being in bed for a week was interesting and a lot harder than i ever thought it would be, i was told that people who suffer acute asthma attacks generally have a low survival rate, i cant remember the exact number but it was low enough to cause a reaction from everyone. We left the hospital and i was told i wouldnt be able to go back to school for at least a month, obviously any kid would be thrilled to hear that but i was super happy because it meant time away from hell on earth. 

However the recovery process during that month kind of set the precedent for a hole i got trapped in and am still trapped in, doing nothing for a month meant i got into some pretty lazy habits but also i got used to being on my own world just playing xbox and watching tv during the day. Transitioning back into school life was harder than anticipated because it was half days to start off with and that was for about 2 weeks. Fast forward a bit and the bullying starts again because fuck it why not bully the kid fresh out of hospital right? it gets to exam period and i have full on sacked off school, i skip most days and get put into the assisted education program where you take exams in a different room and have a personal TA and some counselling sessions, of course none of this really helped me because i just didnt have any care for my education i just wanted away from school asap. I by some miracle without studying at all managed to scrape by with enough GCSE qualifications to go to 6th form on the condition that i would have to take english and maths alongside a foundation year. This leads onto my next problem:

For more reasons unknown to me which i can only chalk up to she cant be bothered, my mum decided for me that i wasnt going to go to a college in my hometown, i would have to instead go to live with my dad and do my 3 years of college there. Now i should probably explain why this is a problem, my dad and I dont get on well, we havent for as long as i stopped being a child and we still have barely any real relationship, i just talk to him like once a month to talk to my little brother and sister who obviously i have no reason to not have a relationship with. I wont go into as much detail here because this post is already feeling too long but theres so much more to get through. Long story short my dad was extremely emotionally abusive, anything that he didnt like would be met with screaming banging on things and threats of physical violence, this would be for anything from not doing the dishes to not studying earlier than what was on my plan. This again warped my view of education because i wasnt really doing courses i enjoyed but rather what was available to me and i didnt feel inspired to commit to it by studying, most of my study time was just sneaking my phone on silent. This went on for 3 years straight, i was isolated, the only person i really interacted with was my abusive dad and my teachers and classmates when i had to. When i tried to confide in my mother she simply told me other people including herself had it worse and hes just strict and does it because he cares about me and wants whats best. So i gave up on that as well. Throughout my life one of the few things i really enjoyed was playing video games and I used it as an escape to just ignore my real life situation and responsibilities, how healthy that is is up for debate but if i didnt have that escape who knows if i'd even be typing this here now. He didn't like that i played video games because he said that it was pointless and took away time i could be studying or looking for work, so he took it away and never let me have it back on any occasion after half of the first year. 

Thats when things got really bad for me, without something to pass the time and take my mind off of things my depression and suicidal tendencies came flooding back, i started self harming and i still look at the scars along my arms sometimes and get reminded of how bad things were back then, i never thought that they would still be there 6 years later, i wish i had thought about that. Somehow 3 years later again without really putting in any effort i managed to complete my A levels and get enough points to get into University. on a foundation entry degree, I guess this was when i was happiest because i was finally free from my parents and maybe i could be someone new and different, I never would have imagined myself where I am now 4 years ago.

Uni life started off fine, i was still avoiding people and keeping to myself but a couple of people on my course would always sit next to me and try to talk to me, I guess because seeing someone sitting on their own in their first year of Uni made them want to include me so i even managed to have friends, the first year had some hardships because i was never taught how to budget or be independent so of course money got tight towards the end but aside from that i don't think my first year had any issues, i passed without any issues and found myself advancing to the first year of the actual degree. I wont go into detail for every year but i'll just say that apart from the odd times we'd go out together I still mostly stayed in my flat playing games or watching stuff online, I didnt party and I didnt study, I just kind of drifted, then for whatever reason i cannot remember i got into an argument with my mum, i cant remember what about but she sent me a message saying that she was done with me and i didnt really know what to feel, I just kind of stopped, I stopped going to uni, i stopped going out i stopped everything, i just started spending every day waking up, playing games and eating junk food, sleep, repeat. As you can imagine having a lifestyle like this really did a number on my mental and physical health. I would go an entire week without showering sometimes more, my only human contact was taking my food from downstairs, this was my lowest point. 

Obviously i failed the year because i didnt attend or do all the work. The next year i was allowed to stay at the Uni and take up a different course, thinking that i could just power through it, but apparently during all of this student finance (the company that pays your tuition fees) turned around and said they wouldn't fund this year of learning for me, which obviously kind of fucked me over completely. Because they told me I wouldn't be funded i decided that there was no point in going, because i certainly don't have 9k just laying around to pay the fees myself, I didn't attend a single lecture all year and lived the same unhealthy life i had lived towards the end of the previous year for the entire year, it was horrible. The one beacon of hope that i could find was that eventually i had to start benefits as i didnt get money to pay the rent or anything so that covered that, meanwhile there was a local game store that ran a tournament for the game a play and i really enjoyed going to that once a week and made friends with the team i was assigned to, my life finally felt like it had some form of normality, i had a decent friend group, i was finally going out and i had something to look forward to whilst i tried to find proper work to fill my time and move into my own place, but unfortunately i couldnt find work and it came time to decide what i was going to do next in the summer, at this time i had another argument with my mum because she began to catch on that clearly something was wrong and i didnt want to go to university and do a degree i had no interest in.

We hadn't spoken in almost a month and i was sure we had cut ties but then she messaged me pleading me to come to an open day for a course that did in all honestly sound extremely appealing to me so i went and the place seemed nice and this where I am now, i got onto the course and i'm currently here now in the same situation but worse that i was in for the 3rd year at the previous uni, i havent attended almost any of the classes i'm almost certainly going to be kicked out or have to retake the year, but thats not even the worst part, the worst part is that i'm still being asked to pay for other years that i was told would be funded including this year, meaning i'm in an insane amount of debt with no way to pay it off, this year also isn't being funded despite being told it would be and i'm currently in negative balance in my bank account with the next payment of my underfunded maintenance loan coming in on the 20th of next month, i havent eaten in 3 days already and i dont feel all that good, my parents aren't an option and i have tried to ask for help in the loans/assistance reddits but i got marked as a scammer because i wasn't getting any replies but kept trying, I don't know what to do, I think I am well and truly ready for the end, I don't see how I can recover from this hole i put myself into, I'm 23 years old, with no degree, debt, no work experience meaning i cant get any jobs despite the 100's of applications i've probably sent off by now, i've never had a romantic partner, hell i've never even had a real best friend, i'm completely alone and I don't think anyone will miss me when i'm gone.

I'm sorry this was such a long read, but I don't have anyone else to talk to and really explain things to, so this is my last resort, I dont think i want to die, but i really don't see how I can live on.",1

Yesterday I had a birthday party with my friends. Of course it was great, but it was mainly an attempt for me to get some Dopamineâ„¢ï¸ through people I considered friends. We live together and I try to do shit that would bind me with them. Simple stuff, like cooking a bit, doing common household chores around the kitchen and common places, going to the drugstore when someone's sick or stuff. But there's no feedback. When I ask them something about where is something like a bag for cold food (don't know how it's called, a bag where you put frozen stuff when going to the grocery store) no one batted an eye and helped me to find it. Asked someone (by text) to get me instant ramen in store and them â€œWhoops, sorry, guess I forgotâ€. 

Same with my work. I'm treated like an everyman when almost everyone constantly forgets about shit I ask them to do and rely on. 

I feel completely alone. Not like *alone* but with no person I can rely to. My close ones make me sick. Social interaction makes me sick. My work makes me sick. My constant struggle with my mental complications make me sick. My corrupted country makes me sick. The whole world makes me sick.

I recently had to go to the hospital per my therapist (or get IVCd). That was a month ago and nothing has gotten better. No meds have helped and I still find myself planning my death. My psychiatrist prescribes me ambien and I've googled the lethal dosage. I have more than enough. Part of me wants to live but the part that wants to die is bigger. Sadness is like an ocean. Sometimes you swim but right now I'm drowning and I'm not sure there is any coming back from it. Part of me wants to do it in my birthday but I fear that will just devastate my family even more.

"I generally steer clear of making posts of this nature since I don't like discussing my personal life on social media. That said, this is something that I feel I must be open about in order to come to terms with it. To contextualise, I'm a 16 year old girl and I'm originally from Eastern Europe, but I now live in the UK. This may be a very long read and I'll be sure to TL;DR.

I was diagnosed with autism at the age of 4. I'm not 'low functioning' (for lack of a better term; feel free to suggest one) per se, but to other people, it's pretty obvious that I am developmentally disabled. I have poor fine motor skills, struggle to articulate my thoughts and am extremely susceptible to meltdowns when not on birth control (I'll explain this later).

For most of my early childhood this was largely not a huge issue in my life. I received good support and people were usually empathetic towards my struggles. However, things started to go slowly and then eventually very dramatically downhill once I got my period age 10.

My parents noticed that I had menstrual cycles that were on average around 21 days in length. Initially, they weren't too worried and assumed they would eventually become more regular as time went on. They didn't. They became shorter, and when I last calculated them, my cycles lasted 18 days on average. This messed up my hormones and I became extremely depressed. This depression peaked around my period. I don't mean that I got typical premenstrual symptoms; in the days leading up to my period, I would self harm, have suicidal thoughts, experience very violent and dramatic mood swings, become extremely sensitive to sound and texture and lose interest in my hobbies and friends. I suggested possibly having PMDD but this idea was dismissed by my parents and doctors.

I first attempted suicide when I was either 13 or 14 (but definitely no older). I didn't inform my parents of this, but only because I didn't want to upset them or make them feel like they had failed me as parents, because they definitely didn't. I then attempted once more aged 15.

During this time period I was prescribed the combined oral contraceptive pill. Theoretically, I am supposed to 'tricycle' them, or in other words, take three months' worth of packs and then take a break. I did this until the second most recent attempt in October of last year. This was the first one that I told anybody about and you may not be shocked to hear that it happened whilst I was on a 'period break'. I went to A&amp;E the next day, where I waited for seven hours before being seen by a therapist for twenty minutes who told me that I seemed to have things 'under control' and took no action except refer me to another therapist, who I had one appointment with where I heard the same thing. It was my mother's birthday that day and I have not forgiven myself for making her spend it in A&amp;E. She stayed mostly collected throughout it all but I could tell she felt very upset and shaken. Since this, I have stopped taking breaks and now do not have periods at all. This is massively helpful but my situation is still not great.

It's partly for that reason that I didn't inform her of my most recent attempt in December. It was also because I was due to fly to Canada the day after the attempt and couldn't bring myself to jeopardise the trip. I considered calling a suicide hotline once I was in Montreal but ended up not doing it, mainly because when I looked up numbers to call, I couldn't find one in Quebec that offered English counselling, but also because my mother discouraged it because of what we would be charged (please remember, she didn't know that I had attempted suicide).

I'm in Year 11, which in the UK is the final year of high school. I'm currently caught up in revising for my GCSEs, which I'm doing OK with from an academic perspective, but struggling to cope with mentally. I'm also being bullied; less than in previous years but still in a way that fucks me up even though I pretend it doesn't. I used to be targeted for my personality and mannerisms, which I've given up being upset about since I've accepted that I don't carry myself typically. Recently, though, they've shifted to targeting my appearance.

This may make me sound shallow, but as a 16 year old girl, having my appearance mocked and scorned is completely crushing. A few months ago it was never something I gave much thought and I never felt insecure about my appearance outside of typical concerns teenage girls have. People call me 'ugly' and laugh at me to my face. I've never been in a relationship of any kind and, at the risk of sounding like an incel, this does not give me hope for the future and makes me question if I am physically attractive to anybody. It makes me feel arrogant for having ever thought that there was nothing wrong with the way I look. And I'm starting to spiral emotionally because of it. 15 year old me would have laughed at the idea of me being so insecure about my physical appearance, but for me, it was one of the few things I had genuine confidence and pride in and now it is being taken from me.

I feel very shallow and fragile for feeling this way. I'm 16 and have four attempts to my name and it's embarrassing. I hate that I'll never really be able to disassociate myself from that because this isn't what I want to look back on in 10 or 20 years time.

TL;DR I'm a 16 year old autistic girl who has attempted suicide 4 times and is now reconsidering due to bullying concerning my physical appearance.",1

"As the title says. I'd like to tag her reddit account but am unsure if that breaks any rules. I believe the only reason she is holding back is fear of what would happen to our 1year old son. She has attempted before in the past before we were married.

Saying the last few months has been unkind to my family is a severe understatement. Lost my job and couldn't find work for several months that eventually led to our recent eviction. As a result, I've been forced to return to long haul truck driving so I am unable to physically be there for her while she stays at her extremely mentally abusive parents home. I've managed to secure her a better place to stay with a friend of mine and even a place for our dog, but thats the limit of what I can do. I'm bad at feelings, but I'm a good listener, and I am completely lost how to handle the situation. She wants to run away and feels as though she drowning. That nobody cares or doesn't want to notice. I am afraid she came forward to me today because she is getting ready to follow through, and I'm over a thousand miles away with no way home and *completely* out of my depth. I need advice / help and, if possible, a show of community support I can send her way.

"So im going to tell you a â€žlittleâ€œ about my Situation. I am usually a pretty happy Person. I like doing fun Things like going out with Friends who ive known pretty much all my life (im 23 ) and i have a passion which Is Film making. But Since i started with school even at a Young age i always had Problems concentrating and focusing at School it just isnt for me because I don't see the benefits from it. I also think the school system is extremly outdated. Last September I started my education ( I live in Germany and the English word for ausbildung translates to education.. ) I work in a world known firm which im not going to name because of a couple of reasons which aren't related to my problem though. I would say it's pretty fun because all of my co workers and bosses are pretty nice and always want me to succeed and do good. I'm also pretty good at this job. Even though I got a lot for me going in this particular job I don't really see me self working in this job for the rest of my life. I'd rather make a living doing films. But I could imagine working for a few years while working for my dream and that's not a problem. But school is a major problem for me (in Germany you have to go to school while being in Vocational training, another word for the German word Ausbildung) it's not that easy and I am literally crying everyday that I come from school ( School is 2 times a week ) I can't concentrate well in school and I miss a lot of school material while trying to focus on a topic. When I have to write an exam I become depressed as f*ck from Studying. Everytime I Imagine working or having school I have suicidal thoughts and can't get out of my bed for days sometimes. These thoughts are sometimes so bad, I imagine myself to end it all.. I also have a girlfriend which is my biggest supporter and the best human you could ever imagine. She gives everything trying to cheer me up and help me with my problems while working a 9 to 5 job. We want to marry and this is why I even got this job. Because of cultural reasons her family won't let her get married unless her future husband gets a â€œsecuredâ€ Vocational training in case something happens in life that I have something to fall back on. Me and her have the same outlook on this â€œculturedâ€ living, it's f*ckin stupid. I can understand her parents as well but it's just that I am at a totally burned out point in my life that I can't get motivated to finish this all.

"I'm 24 years old and have recently graduated from college with a BA in art. Art has been my passion since I was a little kid and I hope I can one day have an exhibition showcasing my art. 

So back in 2019 just a few months after graduating college I applied for this artists residence program. I knew that I probably wouldn't get accepted as theseÂ  residences are usually very popular and I was still buliding up my
career in art. But I still wanted to try and get more experienced in writing applications and though I'd give it a go and you never know I might just be lucky enough to be accepted. 
This particular application had to be sent in by post. So I asked my mum for a stamp. Later that day my dad sees the stamp booklet and asks what it was doing there. So my mum told him. He just conpleatly lost his shit and started yelling at my mum. He was arngry that my mum hadn't told him about my plans to apply for this residence. I could hear the yelling from my bedroom and came down to see what it was about. 

I can't remember everything that happened and what was said. But basically my dad felt that this was a terrible idea. That the residence wouldn't be good for me and that I shouldn't be moving out. 
I kept trying to explain how there were many benefits of doing this residence. And how I wouldn't be moving away forever. Besides I was 23 at the time. A lot of people my age had lived away from their parents. He, however, couldn't get his head around it. He thought the residence program wasn't legitimate. Despite the fact that I found out about it through my college lectures and how they literally give us seminars on how to apply to these residences. 

He keep yelling and screaming causing my mum to cry and sleep in my sister's room that night. 

I didn't let the events of that night keep me from pursuing my dream. Fast forward to a few days ago and I'm working on another application for a artist residence. This one also has to be sent in by post. So this time I tell my dad what I'm doing just before he went to bed. He rolled his eyes but didn't say much. 
The next day I'm printing off my application and I can hear my dad speaking negativity about this residences to my mum.

My mum is so kind and loving and supportive of me and my dreams. I really couldn't ask more of her. 
Anyway. I come into the room and tell my dad that I can hear him talking about me. 
He says similar stuff to what he said back in 2019. How he's thinks its a bad idea. How he thinks I shouldn't be moving out. He is of the belief that I'm looking at this with rose tinted glasses. I try to explain how I'm not some stupid little kid just following some whimsical dream. This is my passion. Its the thing I have a degree in and very much plan on pursuing. 
For some reason he cannot understand what a 
residence involves. I thought the team residence made it fairly obvious. However I try to explain how its a place you live and work in. So you can produce artwork in a proper studio. He's still just shaking his head saying its a bad idea. I ask him why he thinks its a bad idea but he just cuts me off and tells me to tell him why its a good idea.
Once again I try to explain the benefits. Because I'm just making small bits of Watercolour paintings in my bedroom and having a studio would be so much more ideal.
He stars asking questions about how they chose people. I explain about how you send in a cover letter, an artist cv, and images of your work.

For some reason he keeps referring to the residence as a course. My mum and I tell his how its not a course its a place to live and work. He doesn't seem to understand. 
He says how the only people who will benefit from this course are the people running in. 

He seems to believe that because I wouldn't be paid to attend this residence that its a waste of time. 
I'm not even asking my parents for money to fund this residence. I planned to pay the rent myself. 
The he says how I should be looking for work. He's a bit of a booomer. He seems to think that there's loads of jobs going round and I just couldn't be bothered to get one. Not true. 

I had a job not too long ago but it was temporary contract work which ended a few weeks ago. 

He has the nerve to say that when he, himself has been unemployed since the early 2000s and my mum is the main breadwinner.
He just happens to be related to wealthy parents whom he inherited loads of money from when they died. He doesn't know the struggle of looking for work or having a strict budget. 
I asked if he'd prefer if i were in some dead end job that made me miserable. No he says. He'd like to see me in a job that makes me happy. And he sort of suggests to continue with art on the side but apparently working and doing an art residence is just too much. 

Anyway, getting back on track. He mentioned how he thinks I'm too vulnerable and not ready to move out. I don't know how he's going to react when I have enough money saved up to move out. But he can't stop me from moving out and living my own life. I haven't even been accepted by the residence program and he's acting as if I'm leaving to live on the other side of the world.
Everything up to this point has been very upsetting and stressful and depressing. But than he goes and says that I'm not good enough or talented enough. Thst these no future in this residences. No future in art. 

That fucking hurt but I highly suspected this. I told him that I already knew that. This man hasn't even seen half of my art. Hasn't see what I'm capable of doing. And doesn't understand how the art world works. If I were bad I wouldn't have gotten my BA. It's still so hard to not let his words get to me. I'm still planning on applying for open calls to residences and exhibitions. I know i have talent and I work hard. Even if I'm not currently good enough that doesn't mean I should stop. The only thing that will stop me from having a future in art is if I give up. So I won't give up until I have made it.",2
"For the context, I'm 20 years old, soon to be highschool graduate. So here is what's going up in my mind right now. 

No matter what i write up here it's surely happened before. What is there in being your own individual if your entire life is just a copy paste of someone else's? My decisions won't matter in the long run, because my life is to insignificant. And year by year I feel my presence getting weaker and weaker
Sooner or later in gonna start working in some industry i don't want to work in and I will feel happy. But I don't want to be happy from something like this. I want to accomplish something but don't have the drive to do it. I want to be special but I'd rather watch YouTube than learn or train something.
My school will be ending in 2 months and I feel weirdly nostalgic thinking about it. Maybe I'm proud of my achievements, which I don't even remember, or maybe I'm happy I'm in a situation I have brought myself into. Maybe I feel like my movie is ending and i need to plan our Mr finishing move. 
Like I said, I will be finishing highschool and I feel like it's an appropriate ending for me. Get a certificate, be happy from getting it, and ends it all. It will be fulfilling. All of my life has been waiting for this moment to happen, but I don't want another chapter of my story. I only want this single season of this TV show.

"Been suicidal for a few years and today im done. Ive been bullied since grade 1, my father used to bias me when i was young, i was lied too by damn near everyone, lost my mom in 2018, attempted on multiple ocasions, nobody ever fucking listens to me, and im finally past my tipping point. I haven't had the thoughts for a minute now but today they came back full force and I frankly am just tired of living. Life fucking sucks and Im over it. Tonight i plan on taking my life.

EDIT: final message before I go. Since im going to go anyways, i pulled out my vape (i quit multiple times already) and started going to town. My throat now burns and I feel super weak (head rush from the nicotine) so I plan to relax, and when I can move again, grab my knife and end it all. I also have medication im going to down before i start to...attempt fully. If I live, I may (cant guarantee) re edit this post. Don't feel bad for me, I've wanted this. I ACTIVELY want this.

9mm, smaller. Better penetration, but maybe won't penetrate skull? 

.40, feeling like it's the best of both worlds between 9mm and .45, bigger and more power.

.45 bigger, but slower bullet, maybe won't penetrate skull either at point blank range. 

.357 sig, feeling like it should be either this or the .40, although my military friend says .40 sucks and 9mm is better than .40. 

What do you think? Been watching penetration videos on YouTube but obviously none of them are for a skullx or point blank.

Really don't want to end up in a hospital bed. Was planning on doing it at my temple but read there is no brain matter at the temple may not work.

"When I was around 6-7 y.o my dad got a scholarship in Australia. I was really happy to be there. I was someone who had lots of friends, exceptional grades, etc. But that turned 180Â° once I came back from Australia to my home country..I just don't know why.

Junior high was pretty average execpt my grades were starting to fall and I got the occasional teasing because I had a 'different' English accent. Then come high school when everything hit real hard. 

My grades were below par, my dad didn't allow me to hang out with friends, he started being a heli parent and would make irrational night curfews. I also got into numerous trouble with school. 

Over time, what I thought were my friends left me one by one. They even spread a rumor that I was gay (a big no in my country). And to top it off, my girlfriend cheated on me. I felt so desolate and unwanted. Ever since that I became socially awkward and has started to stutter/mumble in my speech. I thought about jumping off a roof but canceled

Eventually I just ate my depression and loneliness while at the same time gaining 10 kilos off it making me obese.

Last year I got accepted to uni in a city away from home. It gave me my much needed liberty away from my dad. I tried making friends, did the usual stuff but was shrugged off being not 'cool' enough or was just a plain awkward person. It kills me looking people left and right are with their friends or s.o being happy while there I am walking by myself alone to sit in class alone again.

Being in uni also made my mind grow wild. I've thought of many different ways of how ordinary objects can be used to kill me. I've tried swerving my motorbike onto an oncoming 18 wheeler but was too scared. I also bought a rope..a decision to use it thats been back and forth.

It feels like I'm on a razor thin wire between doing it and not doing it. I just can't...",1
"Full offense, but a lot of people here lie and lie and lie: â€œgonna kill myself tonight for sure.â€..no you fucking won't, the stats are low. Very low. I'm gonna be realistic and honest, I probably won't kill myself. I wish everyone else would be honest as well that they probably won't go through with it...but the twist is that I might. WE might. And that's where we need support. I woke up today and called out of my job and took a mental health day but I'm still feeling slightly suicidal. Life fucking sucks and I have no purpose. Religion destroyed me, and my job is emotionally draining but pays my bills so it's a tough situation. I have a happy life with my partner so I feel guilty feeling like I want to die because he does make me genuinely happy but I often find myself too emotionally dependent on him because he is the only thing that makes me deeply happy. Anyways, I just would appreciate some kind words without being one of those people 100% threatening to do it if I don't get a response.",0

I opened this stuff to my parents and said that i shouldnt feel that way because im living in a comfortable life they had to rant out and say when they were young life was harder and stuff. That i dont have the right to feel this way because they to were pressured back then. Then my step mom said that i should just die and to tell my real mom that she wished i was never born. I also opened about me being stressed over school and how i want to give up. My step mom said that i shouldnt go to school anymore. Its just really triggering for me, i really want to die rn.

"After being in such a long, unhealthy and abusive relationship, I have been dating again. 

At first I was optimistic. At this point, after so many dates that went nowhere, I don't think I will ever find someone to be with for the rest of my life. I haven't felt like I really clicked with anyone. The men who seem to have the right qualities aren't interested in me. 

Nobody normal is interested in dating a disabled person, even when it's an invisible disability. Even being attractive can't overcome that. I have no career because I got sick. Nobody wants to deal with that. 

I'm tired of seeing everyone else in happy marriages with families. It just reminds me that I'm not good enough and won't ever be. I'd rather just die than be alone for the rest of my life.

I have a lot of great qualities and a lot of love to give. Just no one to share any of it with. I feel like today might be a bad day for me. Hopefully I can keep myself from ending it all.",4

"first of all let me say i dont have a problem with myself, im good the depression isnt about anything personal. my thing is more existential. human beings have made great leaps in the last hundred years which when you think about it is just a speck on calendar. as far as movies and music to me it just seems like every song has been written and every tvshow/movie has been made and we as a species are just kind of going through the motions. to add to this is this innate sense of self destruction that humans have, its hard for me to put into words but it seems like we have come to do what w need to do and our time is probably up. i mean how many times can we see the same movie (franchise reboots anyone) or the same songs as we run out of original melodies on top of other factors such as a.i and world friction. to me it seems like we are just tapering towards an end and id rather it not be som long drawn out song and dance. im not sure if that makes sense but thts how i could verbalise in a way my feelings",5

"holy shit things went bad fast. Last year I went into deep depression, however I recovered over the summer and things were seemingly looking up. I got a job, my grades were good and was hanging out with friends regularly. However the past two weeks things have went to absolute shit. My parents decided they wanted to try some ""parenting"" and decided I spent ""too much time on video games"". Even though I really only played 1-2 hours a night. It was one of the main ways I interacted with my friends as well. After that they decided that my phone was distracting me so it was confiscated as soon as I got home from school. Then they decided to take my door off the hinges to look in on me more. The worst part is i don't even know why they are doing all of this. My grades were good, A's and B's and in 6 AP classes while working 20 hours a week and maintaining a social life. Everything was going so good. Now I get home and feel empty and alone. I can't even cry in privacy. then they have the audacity to ask ""Honey whats wrong, why are you sad?????"". I just dont understand.",4

I don't want to say I have anxiety, because I don't have panic attacks anymore 

I don't want to say I used to cut, because I only did it for a few months

Best part about the winter is that the water is so cold here. I've thought about jumping in and never coming back. I've thought about this probably at least once a day since it got cold out. It's a spot where other people have disappeared. Maybe if I take a bunch of Xanax or something that will help mess me up so much that I die easier. I've written suicide notes before but I go back and read them and think they sound stupid so this time I'll keep it brief. 32 years I tried. I held on for my mom and brother but I don't have any fight left in me. I'm tired. I just want to rest forever. I'm sorry to everyone but you will all be fine in the grand scheme of things.

"Last year i got done with my senior highschool year and despite working soo hard for since june till the next june, studying hours daily i ended up falling short of the percentage i needed to enter the major i wanted to which is computer science and let myself and my family down. I had to major in finances since it was my only choice and i am hating it. Moreover i am hating the fact that i am living with myself as a failure, i never achieve anygoals that i want and i never get anywhere. I have OCD which i am taking medication and therapy for and it has been kicking in so hard lately with all the negativity making me go crazy. I am always depressed and my family is disappointed from me. I just feel like a burden now on every body around me i always have breakdowns and my family always blasts me for it. All my relatives are engineers and other good majors and jobs and i am stuck in this. i am sorry if my writing isnt organized but i am so disoriented right now. I feel like if i just die i would relief every body around me from my burden and relief them from the shame of having me. I cant stand living with my self knowing that i an a complete and utter failure. I dont deserve anything. I will never get anywhere in life i just want it all to end. i just want to die i cant live with myself anymore. And it is a relief knowing that when i die no one will care as i dont want to hurt anyone. I have no friends, my family wish they didnt have me. My relatives didnt even care to call or visit me when i was hospitalized after a cycling accident. I just wish to die and be forgotten instead of living in misery and burdening my family. I dont want to kill my self because i am a bit religious and suicide is prohibited in my religion but i wish i could. I just want to die i cant live anymore. I hate my self. I hate seeing my self in the mirror every morning.I hatr waking up and knowing i am still alive. i cry my self to sleep every might wishing i never wakeup again but i still do.

"I got no talent whatsoever. I got nothing I want to do. I tried hard to search for what I can do and what I'm good at, just to find out I'm actually hopeless. That I have no fucking talent whatsoever. No motivation for anything as well. I'm a huge disappointment to everyone around me and it hurts. I love my friends and family, I want them to be proud of me, but there is nothing about me to be proud of. Until recently, I have tried my best with everything. Studying, socializing, classes I was taking, everything. I had the motivation of making my parents and friends proud. Of being a useful human being so they can love me. So I can be loveable. I lost that motivation recently. When , said my younger sister is better than me and laughed. I got pissed and told them I was trying my best and they told me that I wasn't and that my result grades were the evidence. (I got 2 B's in math and social studies by 0.1 and 0.2 difference each, otherwise all A)They called me dumb and that they regret spending so much money on me if I was going to be this way, not working hard and not getting the best results. They said that I was acting depressed for no reason and I am whining about my life because I am spoiled. To break me completely my father said he is losing motivation to go to work and earn money because I am wasting it. Then my mother said I disappoint her. It is my fault that I couldn't get straight As on everything and I admit that I could have done better if I pushed myself harder, I admit that I should have done that but those words did hurt a lot for me. At that point, I still wanted to impress my friends but then my parents told me they won't want to hang out with me if I keep this up and continue being dumb, useless and not helpful. That made me feel like every effort I'm making is useless. Nobody ever told me I was doing a good job, my parents didn't compliment me whatsoever. I am done. I was diagnosed with depression and even then my parents never took me seriously saying that I lied. I want to be a loveable person and be loved. These days I have no motivation to do anything. I just want to die. May sound like I am whining, but my parent's validation were all I want and what I lived for until now. I don't know what to do and I dont even know what I am writing here but I just really, really want to die, disappear so my parents dont have to waste their hard earn money on me anymore, and could support my talented younger sister instead. I hope they could use the money to go on vacations and do something useful, instead of wasting it on me. I am a burden to people around me and I hate it.

"I'm 19 and first attempted at age 7. I've basically wanted to die for most of my life. I've attempted several times since then. Most recently I was about to in august but realized just before starting that the mode i selected was physically impossible for me.

I am not in college and am unemployed and looking for a job. I've been looking for months, but I live in an isolated area and don't know how to drive so my options are nonexistant. 

When I was in school, I was active in theater and would ask my closest friends to come to my performances, and they had no desire to support me, even though they knew how much it meant to me, even though I offered to arrange a ride for them and pay for their tickets. I was always the one who had to make plans, and my best friends would frequently cancel plans on the day of. One of my best friends was still in her pajamas when I came to pick her up once, and she told me she didn't feel like going out after all and shut the door in my face. This same friend called me an hour after my 18th birthday party started already to tell me that she would rather not go. 

I haven't seen most of my friends since graduation, and most of those I have, when I run into them in public, they ignore me or pretend not to recognize me. I have a bunch of internet friends I'm close to and have known a while, but they like when I send them funny memes but they don't care about me as a person, and I don't blame them. My family doesn't really care either. They did when I was growing up because I'm the youngest, but now that I'm an adult no one gives a shit. 

My parents had a big messy divorce and the bank took the house as a result, and I had to give up my whole life and everything I've ever known to move halfway across the state with my mom. The whole experience was very traumatic and I'm plagued by horrific nightmares every night. I've been on 3 different antidepressants in the last 6 years, and not one has worked. I have a lot of health problems too, which have only worsened despite my best efforts.

I have no direction for myself. I don't want to go to college. I'm in constant pain. All I can think about is wanting to die. I beg god all the time to let me die, because i can't take it anymore, but I'm still here. What I wanted more than anything was to be in the entertainment business, but I've been refused even ensemble parts in every audition.

If you want to have an idea, my mother has a borderline personality disorder, which means she was violent, physically and emotionally. My father is narcissistic, he biasd me emotionally, making me feel like a burden. Never keeping his promises. I've never been happy for a long time with them. I'd say, for my life, 10% happy, 90% in pain. Now I'm 21, I don't know how I survived at this point, but I reached my limit. I tried to take my life away, wasn't a success. My family learned it, and for a moment I thought they finally considered me, but it was for such a short amount of time. I'm always walking on eggs with my parents. I'm in university right now, and it's hard. I just don't have the energy and will to persevere. My energy level is low, very low. I've tried therapy, meds, taking walks, doing sports. But every time I feel like I finally got my life together, something happens and it goes down. For example, I thought I could have some hope two weeks ago, then my cat died. She was my real family, I really loved her and she was always there for me, she kinda helped me a lot with her caring presence. It destroyed me. Then I tried again, but now I've got issues again with the parents. I'm exhausted. I don't have the strength to continue this life. I'm helpless. I sincerely considered ending everything this week. Its just too much for me. 

If only I could erase my memory and start again... Is this possible?",4
"I've been going through so much stress lately I regret not ending my life years ago. Everytime I look back now thinking, If i died back then today i wouldn't have to be going through this today... what do i do, how do i control this",5
"I've been working for about a year at this company. Things havent been working out and I'm not as motivated as I once was.. I still manage to be on time and try but I honestly just dislike the work. I dislike it because I feel like I hardly understand it. I cant understand it better because I cant focus and I'm too tired to put in anymore outside efforts.

The bad news is, once they fire me I'll owe a lot of money for breaching my contract. I just dont know if theres an easy way out of this.",2
"I'm tired of having a extremely hard life, my father used crack till I was 12, beat my mom every day, then he stopped and was still impossible to deal with, now he's on cocaine and we don't talk, my mom has another kid and another husband far, I don't have family and I live in the US alone, I work 10 hours and I don't have shiiiiit, I'm just 19 and I'm so tired u know, why does it have to be so hard, I can barely pay the rent ant eat, I'm tired of not having anyone to rely since was born, well, this is just me letting go u know, srry",4

I tried. I did my best. I loved him with all my heart and soul. But it wasn't enough. I can't live through another heartbreak. I chose not to. I have nothing left. I am hollow. He was my happiness. My joy in life. My soulmate. My heart is shattered into a million pieces. I can't do this without him.,4
My pain and my head keeps Pounding.,0

"I want to keep going. I want to have things to look forward to. 

But I don't.

I really don't want to end it. It seems like the only option right now. Everyone has cut me off, and the few people that have noticed that I am not myself aren't able to do anything to help me. Just living right now is painful. I have nothing left.

I'm sorry to those that cared about me. I just can't handle it anymore. 

I'm planning to be gone by the end of the night. I don't know how or where, but I'm over it.",5
Recently I've been feeling this girl but I know she doesn't like me but I still have major feeling for her but I know it won't go anywhere. And I just want to escape this feeling of loneliness and sadness.,4
"I know that a lot of people say that they lost their younger years to anxiety and depression. There is no doubt that I've definitely lost a lot of years to those same things, but I feel like a large portion of my life has been wasted in school. 

Of course there is a lot of useful things schools teaches that can be applied in every day life, but school has become the worst part of my day, which is especially troubling since it takes up such a large part of it. And after school, I'm just so drained and it makes me so sad to be alive. 

You'll probably have it in most school systems regardless of country, but American school are just such a shitty environment for people who have mental issues. How am I even supposed to properly deal with these issues when I'm constantly bombarded with all this schoolwork? How am I supposed to experience life and enjoy it when I'm trapped in an environment that worsens my mental health and anxiety? 

It's my last year of high school, but I still can't help but feel like I would be happier having dropped out. Realistically, the long term would look worse, but school environments are so toxic a lot of the time. The pressure to conform is just so strong and I don't know how other people feel, but it almost makes me hate being different, it makes me want to be ""normal""

"Hi, I wasn't sure where to post this since it relates to a relationship. I've dealt with depression since my early teen's. It continued to be a major problem in my life until about my mid 20s when I met my current partner. Because of how emotionally mature, supportive and trusting he was, I felt my espisodes we not as frequent or as severe. However as I began to hit my 30s, I started to notice the larger issues that I overlooked when I was younger as not important, like his finanical health (how he views money/saving). He holds a job with little responsibility and low-stress but pays as such (i.e. near minimum wage). He did work overtime for a time to afford a house, which he has but needs me to pay half the mortgage in order to afford it. He says I'm the love of his life but he's not interested in getting married. He's also almost nearly a decade older than me.

I feel trapped because as much as I love him, I want to leave. The major reasons I want to leave are different views towards finances, marriage and moving (he doesn't want to move away from where his parents live). I've been wanting to leave for a very long time but I'm also scared. This decision has caused my anxiety then depression to spring up full force, comptemplating suicide because I'd rather die than live on my own. I haven't lived on my own since my early 20s and every time I lived alone it would result in me being suicidal nearly every day. I struggled, graduated late in college and managed a business degree that did nothing, but earn me an unstable job history and act as a cover to people that I'm doing okay. I just realize how emotionally dependent I am on him and that scares me too. I have no family or friends to talk to about this or for any emotional support. I also hate the state I live in as there are many bad memories here of past bias. My parents also live here and our relationship remains strained.

What I want is to move out of this city and start over but I don't know if that's my depression talking or what. I don't trust my own decisions or judgements. I have low esteem for myself and my choices. Back to the reasons for leaving my partner though---I feel like who am I to say what I want in a relationship since for instance, I can't even hold a steady job so again, makes it hard to leave him. I'm also currently in school again to once more try a job more suitable to my personality--massage. Until then, I'm stuck living with him for another 6 months.

How do you find the courage to live on your own? Past that, how do you find the will or care to live? I don't have anyone. I mean, I won't have anyone if I leave him and that scares me into staying with him too. Or should I just stay with him and work things out? I'm not sure. I just know I can't sleep well, don't eat much and been crying every other day. Sometimes I just would rather die than have to make a life decision...

Are people with mental illness subjected to whatever relationship they can get? Should we be lucky to even have a partner that puts up with us?",4
"I made a throwaway because I'm starting to suspect people I know have seen my previous posts. 

I feel empty; the sort of empty where I feel as if I'm an intruder of my own body and mind. For a good 3 years, I stopped living. I'm merely existing by now. I know by this point that I likely won't live to have children. I've destroyed my system enough with mixtures of starvation and purging to probably have children at this point. I think I'll likely die by my own hands. The only things that actively stops me is maybe the fact I don't want paramedics or my family finding my body. It sounds sick and conceeded but I sometimes think I'm too fat to be found. (Haha ironic) 

I made a deal with myself that I would reach a certain weight and then slowly kill myself via starvation or exhaustion. I know how painful that could be but I deserve it. I'm a poor excuse for a human being. I've tried speaking with family and friends. I don't want anyones sympathy even though I'm venting about this.",1
theres no point in living the monotony of life. I fucking hate this shit. I can't talk about it with anyone I know and I'm so fucking sick of life. I really just want to end it so fucking bad.,5
"I feel so useless and stupid that I don't even know why is wrong with me I am in high school and yet I can't seem to anything correctly. I feel so useless I am not like the other girls at my school and I feel like I might even be annoying and I don't understand why I am like this. Everyday is a struggle to get through the school day and it just keeps getting worse and worse I don't think I can even do this anymore. I just want it to end I want to die. I have markings on my left hand from where I have cut myself when ever I feel this feeling that I am stupid, I am useless, why am I even here I am just a waste of space. But everyday at school I make sure people don't realise what is going on because I pretend to be happy and try to smile all the time so much so that I have become a different peer so I don't even know who I am anymore and I don't understand what to do I just want it to end. I don't think anyone will even read this or will even care but if you do please help I don't know what to do.",1
"I hate my life so much I would be better off dead I feel, everyday is the same and nothing in life gets better, and the few friends I have seen to not like me anymore, a lot of them don't talk to me at all and my school friends seem like they don't like me anymore and I found out a lot of them talking shit about me that I thought were my friends, and I already got bullied for half the year. 

I don't wanna live anymore, and I can't even see a doctor even though I have the legal right to one there is none available and walk in clinics are useless. Canada has shit healthcare 

My grades are so bad and I'm disappointment to my parents. At this point I wanna just drown my problems with drugs. 

Me and my gf keep fighting and having problems and she just moved to a new school and told me how â€œeveryone's been so nice especially the boysâ€ and like that's troubled me because I'm ugly and I have nothing to offer with my personality so I feel like any guy is better for her than I am but I need her.

I want help but there's no one to help me I'm so done. 

None of that made sense I'm just rambling but I just want to die and I'm contemplating it.",4
"Please. Stop me. Give me a good reason I shouldn't just end it. I'm homeless, living in a shelter right now. I have no friends. People I talk to, I talk to because they talk to me. I'm so tired of this. But I'm also terrified. Someone, anyone, help.",4
"To my childhood self,

Fuck you for being an effeminate little boy that made you such an easy target. You could have interesting in ANY FUCKING WAY yet you had to be just a fucking vanilla ass piece of shit in the corner for people to show and shoot shit at. You thought it would make you into a stronger, more interesting person, but it just made you more quiet, more boring and easier to ignore.

Fuck you for remembering the physical and emotional bias your dad did to you and your family.

Fuck you for letting your mom run her little experiments on your body like some sort of lab rat.

Fuck you for speaking out about your suffering when you did. Going to the adults really improved your life and didn't just make your biasrs hate you more while they got off with slaps on the wrist, huh?

Fuck you for remembering your childhood, especially only the bad parts. I'm 25 now and am just now experiencing these again, and you have no idea what sort of hell I'm in getting these vague memories again and again. This is YOUR FAULT!

I want you dead like how I want me dead. I want you to suffer way more than you ever had before just so you won't survive and I don't have to experience it anymore. I don't hold a fraction of this malice and those horrible wishes to anyone but you, but you're the only person in this world that deserves to suffer until you're ash. Kill yourself so you can kill me, too.",4
"As the eldest child, my younger sisters were always favoured more than me i knew that from the age of around 5 but around grade 5 i had a major test and my parents starting hitting me and telling me im useless i was trash and they never should have had me, they were fighting and every time they blamed their relationship problems on me and only me. despite this i still acted normal around them and when i started telling them about my interests they laughed and mocked me for wanting to do things, their philosophy was that i would live the life that they wanted me to live and do everything they wanted me to do. i got depressed at a young age because of this and started cutting, to me it was a way to relieve my stress and anger. now im in an awkward relationship with my parents i flinch every time they yell or even talk sometimes but still act normal around them, i get scared to do even the slightest things wrong yet i still joke around with them. now my sister is going to do the same test and they couldnt even care less about her marks, she complains when her ipad is taken away and the slightest word will make her upset. im kind of glad that i was raised like this and didnt become a spoiled brat like her but i still have mixed feelings. i find that i dont judge other people now, they could literally say the most absurd thiing and i wouldnt care unless they were harming themselves and i feel like its connected to my parents bias but anyway i just kinda needed to rant here since my dad said some things that kinda triggered my memory but ok bye",4
"I'm 23, I have a worthless ass history degree, no physical attraction whatsoever, no real job, no social life, and no hope of getting out of the US because fuck this country.

"I can't do this anymore. I miss my girlfriend, I hate my job, I don't want to move out of my home, I'm letting others down at my volunteer work. Time is not helping and I'm only getting worse. After awhile I started to get drunk frequently. Now I've been slowly starting to mix Tylenol with alcohol. I frequently feel pain in my abdomen for good reason. Sad part is I seem to like being in this pain. Almost comforting.

I won't last much longer if things keep going the way they do. It will only be a matter of time before I go to far with the pain and do some serious damage.

I'm sorry Emily...I broke your promise and I failed you again...",4
"I bought a bottle of wine on my way home from work lastnight. Drinking alone is never good for me but I felt like I really needed to drink. Anyway 2 glasses in I'm trying to find somebody to hang out with, texting all my friends that are nearby and everyone was busy. I felt so lonely, painfully lonely, and I started hating on myself. I've learned to really love myself the past few years but lastnight my dark side emerged and I wanted to hurt myself. I took a knife to my leg and just started cutting, something I haven't done since high school. When I was finished I just looked at it and knew it was a mistake, now I'm going to have to hide it till it heals. No sex, no beach/pool trips, no shorts (the weather is always warm where I live so even though it's winter these things are still an option for me) ... I've limited myself by a few moments of weakness but I'm trying to forgive myself. I just had to get it off my chest. There was only one person I could talk to about it and while he did a lot for me I feel like I needed to say something about it here as well.",5
"My Girlfriend and I have been together for ten years and I don't know what to do anymore. She suffers from depression, anxiety and severe OCD.

Over the last couple of years here anxiety has worsened and over the last few months it's just too much for me, we don't see anybody anymore, if we do she has a panic attack before it and i've ended up having to cancel plans. It's our nieces third birthday party tomorrow and we were supposed to be going to stay up at my parents for the weekend and she doesn't want go. Fair enough, but I have been seeing my family less and less because of her needing her weekends to herself.

She's not from here so has no family or friends here who aren't mine so she really feels like she has nobody else but I'm exhausted. I can ask her family and friends from back home to talk to her but she doesn't want me to tell anyone. She believes she is just in the way and makes everyone's life shit, I try and tell her it's not true but it's so deep rooted into her mind that she just think she'd be better off dead, she's threatened suicide before so I feel like if I leave her even for this weekend she would kill herself as it's not really a threat but just her mindset of thinking she's better off dead. Idk anymore, I really don't. I don't even know if this is just kme being an asshole i'm just lost and confused and tired. I still love her but she just doesn't care about life anymore.

She stopped taking medication about a year ago as she thought it was making it worse, I respected her wishes and tbh, sometimes it seemed fine but lately it's absolutely not fine and she refuses to go back on any form of medication. IDK please help, should I leave? I'm so worried about her but also worried about myself and just feel sick.",4
I hate my self so fucking much. I do everything anyone tells me I can't stand up for my self. I'm school people throw shit at me and you know what I do nothing like the pice of shit I am. The only thang that ever makes me feel better is getting high and that's a fucking problem. I never talk to anybody about my thoughts I'm to weak. Hey you good I just say yeah everyday the same to the point that I just live I'm living but not living I know this is just some rant that goes no where. I used to harm but I got over that but the scars are horrifying everybody notices and bring me down so badly I have no worth to anyone not even myself. I just want to sleep and never wake up.,1
"I am in my 40's, fought high and low with my depression and thought that I was over it but in reality its never have gone away... I am in my life once again living a lie. A lie that is to much for myself to move forward. I have a great family, nice new Home, Nice cars, new business and great career. but nothing seems to make me happy any longer and the more I think and want is to end my life...

Yes I know suicide is the easy way out to a temporary problem. But in my life today its no longer temporary. It feels that I can no longer feel myself to be alive anymore... This is not my 1st rodeo but I did try to end my life over 10 years ago and wish I never survived it but I did and I am here again today thinking that, the feelings I am feeling is to much for one person to take on every day every second and mostly every breath I take...

There are days I want to end my life and finding a way to end it, but I am a POS for not following threw any of. When I go to bed i say a prayer... I now go to sleep, my lord my soul for you to keep, as I don't need to wake in the morning so please take my life and let me rest in peace in my sleep, praise to you my lord my savoir, take my life , take my soul and take away the pain i am living as the pain to live is to much for me to take everyday to wear a fake smile.

Every day I drive my vehicle to the office and thinking what pole, what bridge, what wall or Truck I can drive into, or what building I can jump from so that I can never feel this pain that I feel

I now know why the funnest man alive as in Robin Williams end his life as now I want to do the same,,

just so hard for me to live in this world alive or dead its just not easy for me anymore but I rather die than live a lie with a fake smile to show I am ok...",0
"Nowadays people are starting to embrace body positivity and are learning to love who they are. So why can't I? Every time I look in the mirror all I see are flaws. My stomach bulges out too much, my face is fat, my acne is ugly, I need to shave, my teeth are yellow, my butt's too small, etc. Why can't I see the good in myself?

My biggest insecurity is my stomach. I can't help to think that I'm fat even though I have an average BMI at 5'5â€ , 140 with playing a sport/working out every day. I think this insecurity sort of stems from everyone around me being stick thin. This one girl in my grade keeps saying how â€œfatâ€ she is when she's half a foot taller than me and weighs less. I know that shouldn't bother me but it does. I also am a gymnast and seeing everyone around me be thin and look good in leotards makes me feel awful.

After eating a lot, I can't help but be so mad at myself later for putting on so much weight, but sometimes I just can't help it. I like food. It's gotten to a point where my lunch is just a granola bar and I'm just hungry throughout my day.

If anyone has any tips to help raise my self esteem it'll be greatly appreciated but honestly no ones probably going to see this. If you're reading this, thanks random reddit user for listening to my rant. You're breathtaking.

"But still, I do not want to keep on living. I have zero hope for the future, nor goals or dreams. The only things that keeps me from doing it is that I'm scared of the pain and just like the memes, mom would be sad. 

I just keep joking about it to my friends but I really really just want to stop carrying on with this life.",5
I can't do this anymore and I've been crying for 3 hours now and I can't get myself to stop. Everyone in my life hates me and my family doesn't want me. My grades are down the drain and I hate how I look. I really don't think it's worth it anymore.,4
"I don't really want to die, I want to stop being so fucked up. And if the best way to do that is to kill myself, that's the route I'll take. But that isn't the only route available, and if there's a way for that to happen through medication or mental healthcare I'll gladly choose that. But the problem is I don't really care if I live or die, so if that course of action is too difficult I'll just take the easy way out and kill myself (I say easy because it'll be easy for me, but the main thing that's preventing me from doing it is how other people will take it).

That being said, I'm not going to avoid saying something to my therapist because I think he'll send me to a psych ward. The best chance I have to get better through meds and therapy is to be honest with what's going on, and I'm completely fine with that. I don't really have anything going on in my life I wouldn't mind sacrificing a week for. Hell, I'm well prepared to sacrifice my own life in order to stop the pain. I've been to a psych ward before, and it's kind of nice since it's a way to kind of die a temporary death and be away from everything else in my life. It's not as good as death though, since I'll still be fucked up in the head and as long as I'm fucked up I'll suffer, but it's better than suffering and still having to do shit.

Anywho, if the psychiatry route doesn't work I can always kill myself, but it seems stupid not to take advantage of psychiatry to the fullest while I can, and that means telling my therapist enough where I could be hospitalized.",3

"I've had suicidal thoughts for a very long time. I've seen my GP, been put on meds, I've been to counselling you name it I've tried. But apart of me just feels like I've had enough and the only option is just to end my life. Sounds dramatic and selfish but if I'm honest I just feel like I have nobody there for me anymore and I'm just disappointing people around me like my parents for example, I know deep down that I'm just a failure in their eyes and all I'm doing is prolonging more upset for them as I've made there lives difficult in certain aspects with my depression and constantly making them worry. But I also feel as tho if I end it then there wouldn't be that worry I'd then be gone. if I speak to my friends about it they'll just turn around and say man up or stop being soft. Which has now just caused me to believe that I don't have anyone there close to me to talk to, feel like Cant rely on anyone anymore and I just would be better off dead. Me and my ex split 6 months ago a short term relationship but that was one thing I felt really happy about and that ended because of how I am, just sad and perhaps not all there, or perhaps I'm just not capable in being in a relationship as there's just clearly something wrong with me. I don't see myself moving on from her to another as it shattered me deeply and I just can't seem to want to get back out there, I just don't believe I'm that type of person for anyone like she was at the time. Many things I could add to the list like I'm mid 20s I only have a part time job and I don't feel motivated or want to look for a career because I just don't feel I'm good enough anymore. Feels as though I'm really done with life and that my times is up and I don't really know what to do anymore. I'm just sad and existing in a world that I don't want to be apart of anymore and I'm typing this really because I don't know who else to talk to about it anymore.

"My problem started about 4 years ago. Generally, I am a calm person - an introvert (more ambivalent), I liked being with myself, I liked to help, I was quite specific, very empathetic, although I stayed with other normal cool people. I couldn't be a dick.
Over time, I noticed that I stand out. Others went somewhere, spent time, etc. Problems started in high school when it came to partying, crazy outings. Everyone snapped, told their exits as if it was unknown. And I didn't have anyone but one friend. I found that something was wrong with me and I began to change. I wanted to reprogram, upload other more extroverted software. At that time I had a completely distorted picture of reality. And for example - I have always been balanced and did not make quick, ill-considered decisions. Seeing that others don't do it, I suppressed it and added it to my new ""software"". Seeing that others do not respond immediately to the huts also so began to do. These small, seemingly low risk examples have changed me. There were plenty of them. I did so with everything. I know it's sick but it was so. I began to think what other people's lives were like. I wanted to experience these beautiful moments that I heard and told them myself. It lasted a long time. My current personality was changed. I copied every behavior and thinking patterns of the ""better"" ones I took an example of. After half a year, I got depressed. I felt terrible. Memory loss, pits. I realized what I had done and wanted to unprogram. I began to think, I analyzed my personality a lot , what should change, how to behave and feel. I tried to remember my previous identity. I had so many copied habits that I didn't know how to behave, feel, think. I didn't feel like myself, as if unreal, in a dream, without contact with feelings, emotions.
The situation continues to this day. I do not know who I am. I don't feel anything, I don't feel myself.
The only thing keeping me alive is the awareness that it used to be good and it's all in my head. I often have thoughts of suicide.
I have sick thoughts - I classify people according to their qualities that are useful and not, I divide people into better and worse. I do not feel anything.
Not once during these 4 years did I feel alive. No sadness, no shot of joy, no intense feeling.
He constantly compares himself to others. I do not know how to be myself - I look at others, I wonder what they feel, how they think, what chances I would face against them. The psychologist and therapy did nothing. Now he keeps in touch with a psychologist who tells me to stop thinking and follow my feelings
I try to do it but I still want to write it. I feel lost. The only thing keeping me alive is reason. Nothing else. He tells me he thinks it all. I don't remember what it's like to be happy. I do not know who I am.

Every time I start to build a life it gets ripped apart in a few days. When I relapsed on alcohol everything goes to shit. I could be going to jail. Life always gets worse. I want to die. I'm 30 and it gets worse and worse and worse. Sure there's small spaces of joy but it's not worth it. I want to slit my wrists vertically. I just want to end this suffering. I've been in love and I've had some good times. But I don't want to go through this life any longer. I also have a physical disability. I'm just a little scared if death but we are going to die either way. I'm scared of pain but I just want this life to end.,3
"Hey, I'm in a 14 year old female (9th grade), and right now I'm in a low point in my life ( no I am not one of those im14andthisisdeep girls haha). At the moment I really don't want to discuss everything yet, but there is this one situation I do.

ALSO please mind that I am bad at expressing myself, so this may sound repetitive.

I'll try to list everything...

My friend group consists of around 9 people (I think, it keeps adding up, and I'll explain later). There is this girl in my ""friend group"" (can't really say 'friends"" because I am not really close to them) who keeps avoiding me. She started to avoid me around the start of the school year. She started show her dislike around me when my friends were talking jokingly, (I can't recall properly, sorry) that if they were not going to receive any flowers in Valentines Day, hence saying some people in my friend group do, they would group up and watch a movie together. I was curious, so I asked something related to it (sorry, can't remember exactly :(, I think I said something like ""Oh! What movie?"" or ""When?"" (like when would this event take place) ). She then rudely replies with ""Who are YOU!?"". This other girl from my friend group just stared at me (Not in a rude way, but in a way I can't read her expression) I was kind of hurt then.

This behaviour kept continuing. Around a few days later, I went to the spot where my friends sat, and sat next to the girl who apparently dislikes me. She IMMEDIATELY stood up and rushed (no kidding, she ran away from me) to the opposite side, and sat there. I just blankly stared at her, again hurt the frick for me. The group stayed silent, then same girl who looked at me then said ""Oh, I know why"".

Because of this, I was in a shit mood. The shittiest mood I've been compared to the whole day. I was walking to my HSIE class (where 2 of my other ""friends"" were in). I asked one of them, (for her privacy, I'll call her ""Sally"") why (let's call her Fiona) keeps avoiding me. Sally replies saying I said something to Fiona *A FEW MONTHS AGO* that pissed her off. Sally then tells me to not worry, and that Fiona is a *""petty person""* . (Honestly, I thought okay, wtf? I actually was actually tearing up a bit due to sadness, not to the extent of crying though)

Timeskip to a few days, (with Fiona going to the opposite side of the friend circle *As AlWaYs!1!,* and with me now, I try no to be near her, but even being the slight nearest, she goes even further away). I asked someone who was friends/close to Fiona while going out of my commerce class to the next period. I explained the situation to her (*whilst clinging to the edge of the wall like that Yandere girl from Yandere simulator because I am awkward af, seriously*). She also responds to something similar. She said Fiano used to act up like that to her and I just need to get used to it. (I was tearing up AgAin (not to the extend to cry) \*le fucking sigh\*). She then adds ""Oh, you don't like it?"". She then says something similar that Sally said before ""She is just petty"" (ugh so tired of hearing that word from everyone).

Timeskip\~\~

She keeps avoiding me, not sitting next to me. Recently I was going to the bathroom with another girl, whilst walking back to class, Fiona responds ""Hey -name-"" and ignores me (wow, how nice...). When I talk, she glares at me. And more, more, MORE negative reactions to me.

Today, I had HSIE class after lunch. I was 'complaining' (not in an annoying way) about how boring it was. And then fucking Piano responds with ""Maybe if you had friends"".

I pause, literally a flash of emotions hit me: hurtfulness, pain, frustration, anger, you name it. I had just enough with her play and said something around (maybe I should of responded differently, more direct? and not nicely?) ""Why do you hate me, whatever you did, just tell me, I will say sorry"" and blah blah blah. (Sorry, I only started to notice I was too kind this year, and that it lead to me being hurt, and people taking the advantage to go on top of me (yeah, there are a few girls, again? why would you hate me?, who dislike me. I won't talk about it because this thread would be WAYYY too long) ).

Fiona then replies with ""Nothing/No you did nothing wrong. \*I just hate you."" .\*I was spreading in a bad mood. Bad morning, had a maths test, didn't sleep because I was staying up studying and also extremely VERY stressed!

The group went silent, stopped talking. I had enough, I don't want to be apart of the group (explain later). I don't want to be near HER. I. fucking.had.enough. I abruptly left the group (sorry, should've mentioned earlier, but I do that more and more often when she does something shitty to me) and walked around, staring at happy (I mean I don't really know) people with their friends, fake smiling.(ugh for some reason I approached some closely just to stare at them.

Ugh fucking amazing life.

Also I will talk about my friends now.

They weren't a fixed group, especially around 8th grade. You know when there is a new student, and the teacher would just ~~force~~ put them in your group? Well, welcome to mine!

Anyways, my group is basically where new people come. There has been 1 from 8th grade (never met her before) and an old friend who came back(left). There would be another girl who would hang out in my group and another one (that one more now). This year, 9th grade, already on our 6th week, 2 girls were introduced (I don't even remember their names).

There are certain things that creates a friend group. For example, if you like books, you stay with bookworms (the ""bookworm group""). Because of this (tho, nothing like that made me feel close to my friends), my friends group isn't so closely connected to one another. Like lunch is so fucking boring now. When was the last time I had fun during recess or lunch?(Note\_ 4 out of 5 days I have school meetings on lunch, just SRC things!) Now people just eat due to boredom, and half of them go on their phones. No (little) interactions created. I am quiet, but not the most quiet in the group, now I am. When they talk, they laugh, I don't.

But seriously, I never felt close to my friends, they would go to parties, parks, movies with each other, where am I? at home. They had photos posted on instagram one time of them in a party. They tagged each other, not including ME (only one, thanks. Btw not close to her though). They printed photo cards of those pictures and shared them to each other as memory (some are on their phone case). One picture was the korean hand heart (that saranghaeyo thingy) they made together as a circle. (Wow, like that didn't;t hurt)

Im not close to them, I feel lonely being around them, and I have no one to talk to, no one to trust. Where do I go now? How do I make friends? Because of this, I've reached out bout my loneliness online (in a few different platforms) to talk to. It's nicer to talk to someone online though.. They don't know me and keep this secret...

Sorry, this was longer than I thought. There is more I want to talk about (I never thought something that I thought was small would end up being this long). I may post some more in the future.

If there is something you want me to elaborate on, please feel free to ask! (But I won't respond if it is too personal hehe). I need someone to talk to...",4
People say bad decisions don't always make someone a bad person. I really feel like that isn't true in my case. I imagine myself feeling eternally shitty and a waste of a life. The hurt I have caused my SO has made me feel like I have no true identity. I wish I didn't have BPD. I wish I could have been better. I can wish and wish but that will never fix things. My body and mind feel useless I can distract myself with friends but I feel so distant from the world. I am filled with guilt. The worst part is knowing my SO has forgiven me and I can't help but think they may not want to be with me for much longer. I would crumble and disappear without him. I am filled with so much pain... pain that I deserve to feel. I wish I could disappear but thinking about dying is horrifying. If the world goes on just the same without me. If I fade into a distant memory to those who I know. I know I need more external help. But no amount of therapy will rid me of the thoughts I have about myself. I fear I will never grow from this. It all seems so dark and temporary.,5
I've tried a good 10 to 11 times in the past year but each have failed yet I still want to try and will try more cos mostly everything is useless. Does the number of failed attempts mean anything or do I have some weird luck,0
"As the title says, I cut myself for the first time yesterday. It was only 2 swipes, but it feels like a huge step back and I don't know what to do. I don't have a therapist and I can't talk to my parents about it because they think its not as serious as it is. I just don't know where to go from here.",4
"Hi, I am having a v intense realization that I've been depressed for a very long time. Though you wouldn't think that if you met me. Every day I slap on a smile and ask myself, â€œwhat kind of beauty am I going to see today?â€ and I allow life to flow. People say I'm so nice and so happy, so fun and charming. I had gotten so good at it I had even convinced myself for the passed 10yrs that I've been happy. Truth is though I don't think I'd know happiness if it hit me in the face. 
I think I've been depressed since young childhood, coming from a wildly dysfunctional military home, being constantly bullied, I turned to sex drugs and alcohol at a very young age in order to cope. Now I'm 25, in a big city, feeling more isolated than ever. I work two jobs, I was going to university but decided to drop out to do a trade. I decided to be poly because I felt so lonely in monogamous relationships but poly has been nothing but heartache. I live with a close friend who doesn't clean at all and constantly has his girl friend over even tho he works nights and she has her own apartment. I don't know how to set boundaries because no one has ever respected them. I've been in and out of therapy (currently out but I guess almost back in). I've been assaulted and biasd. My cat has never cuddled me. I don't know how to make deep connections with people or how to keep friendships. Then I think about the state of the world and feel so helpless and hopeless. There is no point. I fantasize about dying every single day, I think about ending my life every single day. I am so incredibly miserable, I'm so incredibly tired. I want to go to sleep and never wake up ever again.",1

"If you guys want the story as to why, there's an earlier post I made about my story. Though not hugely dramatic, it is too much for me to bear.

"I have to get this off my chest or I'm going to go off on someone. So as you can read back through my posts, I was doing Spravato for a very short time before my insurance pulled the rug out from me. Two weeks into it, that's right - TWO WEEKS, Insurance comes back after pre-approving my treatment and says since I had not shown a 50% improvement they were denying any further treatments. Thanks for the warning fuckers! So of course my depression and anxiety dropped severely after this happened. Partly because of being pissed and irate and outright shocked about how they could even do this. And second, my body and mind didn't care for how I just suddenly stopped treatments. So I've been on a downward spiral for about two weeks now. 
Well the clinic where I was having the treatments has not really got back to me and kind of dropped me like a bad habit now that they aren't getting money from my insurance. When the lady called to tell me she said she would talk to the dr in charge of the program and ask him what he wanted to do. That was almost two weeks ago. I've spoke to her once since and tried calling several times with no call back. Like seriously ... What the fuck? You have someone who was telling you I was severely depressed and suicidal (enough to get approved for disability - which is not easy to do!) and you're just gonna fucking ignore my calls and my concerns and let me go to the wayside? What happened to checking with the dr to ask him about a next step? Is that it? Is it just like - well no more Spravato for you so we are done dealing with you?! I'm fed the fuck up quite honestly. And after waiting all week since talking to her Monday, I'm going to call tomorrow and I'm asking to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge of that fucking place. Let me just add also that when I first contacted them to set up my initial appointment, it took almost two months before I got in there! That's right! Two months! It was the beginning of December when I first called and someone was supposed to call me back and I waited and waited and finally called and went off asking them â€œdo I have to say I'm suicidal before someone will take me seriously and call me back??â€ It was soon after I finally got in there but to me that's a little ridiculous to think of making a suicidal person wait almost two months to start treatment or be evaluated. 
Between that and the insurance screwing me, I'm truly and utterly fed up. It makes me sick and pissed off how the system fails people like me and then they wonder why mental illness is such an issue and has such a stigma around it! Well no fucking wonder. If others are treated anything like I have been, and I have a feeling that many are, then I can see why people lose their shit and either end up killing them selves or others. Let me clarify - I'm NOT in any way condoning that behavior or saying it's okay. I'm simply saying that it's no wonder there's such an issue with mental illness in this county. 
All that being said, where does one go from here? I've tried therapists, countless medicines, obviously the Spravato - all to come to this. To pretty much be treated as if my life means nothing and completely and utterly ignored! I hate to sound narcissistic, but god damn. My life should be just as important as anyone else's. 
Here's the conclusion I've pretty much come to in the last 24 hours. I have to stop depending on anyone to help me deal with this fucking sickness. I have to depend on myself to somehow get better. I am the only one who is here for me. Nobody else gives a fuck. Nobody. Why should they? They have nothing invested in me and I mean nothing. If they aren't getting money from insurance then why bother even returning my phone call right? 
I don't know. If this is what our society has come to, I seriously want no part of it anymore. It's disgusting and I am to the point where I hate people in general. I know that sounds bad, but go back up and re-read my post if you really want to try to understand why I am starting to hate people. I wasn't always this way. Yes, I've dealt with mental illness most my life in some capacity or another. But here in the last 5 years it has hit the absolute bottom of the bottom. I look back at times when I thought I was depressed before and I think to myself - I'd give anything to go back to that time and redo things. 
I don't really have anything else to say. I've rambled on enough. I just had to get this all out in some way. If you made it to this and have read my whole post then thank you. You've shown more concern than the people who claimed to be there for me and deal with my depression - until the insurance money stopped coming.",2
"2020 is kicking my ass so bad. I got laid off in November, and a pregnancy wouldnt allow me to work until now. I got the call that im going back to work starting Saturday, but whats the use?

After waiting for a late payment of Unemployment to come in, and my husband and i taking everything of value to us (PS4, Switch, and even his guitar) to the pawn shop, we're a solid $60 short on rent with no income in sight for the remaining days we have to pay. 
I put my name out for emergency commissions as i figure people might go for it, but in all honesty, no one has. 
Another bomb dropped on me today was that this ""flu"" my 3 year old daughter has had for a few days now is actually Scarlet Fever. Who gets scarlet fever? Is this the 1800s? What happens if my newborn son catches it from her? Is this year the year i lose a child and face my biggest and deepest fear?

"No longer have any passion for my interests, or even any passion for life tbh. Im lonely af, feel worthless and hopeless. I dont want to kill myself though my mind tells me i do. But id much rather be happy, thrive and prosper. Its strange for sure. I'd like to say im a hard worker, im intuitive and a problem solver. There's things i aspire to do, and know im phyiscally and mentally capable of doing in one part of my mind. 

The other part that's always lurking is telling me im a worthless piece of shit and cant do anything and that even if i was successful still nobody would care so whats the point. Recently ive been losing the battle with that other part, and when my mind tries to rationalise my life situation (which isnt even that bad) and thoughts, the conclusion it comes to, is self termination. Sometimes i get too overwhelmed by it and imagine having a gun and pointing it under my chin. I pull the trigger and imagine it all going away almost instantly. It doesnt make me feel better as i do it in moments i might have legit pull the trigger in the heat of the moment. It makes the real me glad i dont have a gun (i live in uk so i cant really get one all that easily anyway).

Edit: I'm feeling calmer now, my demons have been but to bed until tomorrow (i hope). Just want to add, most of the things that my mind perceives as major fucking problems like having no friends or girfriend can be overcome, its not a terminal illness, even if my mind wants me to see it that way. I say this to people a lot but i believe it, with a healthy mind there isnt much a human cant overcome. Look at tyson fury, he was a pork pie with the jelly around it, he was a coke addict. And by getting help with his mental health hes now heavy weight champion of the world. Then people like caroline flack (sorry if i misspelled) got herself in a pretty bad sitaution, and her mental health issues made it seem 1000x worse to her. With a healthy mind she could have gone to court and taken her punishment, and dealt with the repercussions. It would have been hard as heck and taken a toll on her for sure. But it could have been done.

Wanting to die or kill yourself is not a rational thought. Theres nothing rational at all about poor mental health. I think it has helped me a lot understanding the science a lil bit. Just the fact that these chemical imbalances can fuck us up in so many ways. Thinking about that definitely helps bring perspective.",5

When I interact with people, I'm the bubbly, smiley persona that is expected of me.

"Over the past few months, my depression and social anxiety have spiraled out of control. At the end of my junior year of high school I had a really bad breakup and lost all my friends causing me to start self harming and isolating myself from everyone. Thankfully, this acquaintance I had took time out of his day to make music with me at lunch. It really meant a lot to me. He was the only friend I really had at the time. I had hung out with his friends a couple times before throughout high school, so I started playing video games with some of them. Eventually during the summer I got really close to them, and I became a part of their friend group. They really brought me out of that dark hole of depression, and I had never loved a group of friends more in my entire life. I had and still am going through extreme social anxiety, but helped me become more confident in myself and alleviated that a bunch. In the beginning of senior year I hung out with them after-school basically everyday, and it was the happiest I'd ever been. 

I don't want to get into details but then something changed. A bunch of the group dynamics changed that made me felt inferior. I thought they thought I wasn't as funny anymore, and was more weird and awkward. I reverted back to the state I was in with my previous girlfriend, and I started to worry incessantly that I would be abandoned by them. My mindset about the group also changed. I felt like I had to constantly meet their standards and entertain them or else they would abandon me. This has made socializing with them more of a grueling chore than a fun experience. I've isolated myself from them a lot, and I even feel a bit of anger towards them. 

There are these events that happen that make me feel like they think I'm weird, awkward, unfunny, and annoying, so I constantly try to change myself. I try to be less talkative, and apply a tight filter to what I say. I hate who I am. I can't live with myself. I feel like everyone I interact with thinks I'm all of those things, and I can't stand it. I hate everything about myself. My voice, the way I pronounce things, my mannerisms, my sense of humor, my conversations with people, everything. I can't take it anymore.

Right now I'm on 50 mg Zoloft. Tonight I'm going to trip on 300 mg robotussin gels. There's a possibility I could experience extreme even fatal side effects due to serotonin syndrome, but I don't care anymore. I just want to be taken out of this reality for a while. It's not even that I'm suicidal. I'm not trying to kill myself. But if that's what ends up happening, I don't care. I just don't want to be here.",1
"I've struggled with major depressive disorder for years now, I was officially diagnosed in 2016 but I know I had it for about 5 years before that at least. I've had a suicide attempt (right before officially being diagnosed) and since have had ups and downs... the downs happen about every other year.

Tonight I'm sitting at work, wanting to run away, cry, and hide. I've been doing fairly good lately but I just received life changing news a few nights ago, and I am not ready for this change.

I told my SO exactly how I feel and what I want (well maybe I should say don't want), which was relieving and helped me feel better for a few minutes but now I'm back to stressed out and wanting to cry. I'm worried he secretly hates that I don't want the change. Will he break up with me even though we are engaged and haven't had any issues? I hope not.. he always tells me he wants me to be honest with him and not keep things from him, so I'm trying to be open/honest but I know he doesn't enjoy hearing my honest opinions and feelings at times.

How can you bring a child into the world though when both parents would be in debt, one is jobless, we aren't even married yet, I struggle with my mental health/anxiety regarding everything about having a kid even all the crap before they are born, and one parent is a registered sex offender still on probation???

I can't do this. I was hopeful for the first couple of days... but then i started considering more about our situation and how we are NOT ready. I haven't tols many people at all, but I told him today if I can't abort it then I want to seriously give it up for adoption. I just can't. 

Call me irresponsible for not being more careful. I try to have the mentality of ""everything happens for a reason"" but I can feel myself falling apart mentally. Work helps distract me to a degree but there is a lot of downtime tonight and I keep ruminating and feeling down. I'm also pretty sure I'm too far along to get an abortion and it isn't like we can afford it anyway. FML :( :( :(

Hallucinations and hearing voices that arent their. Which makes me think solipsism. But hell im no God when I believe a God. Since I didnt create clouds trees or even DINOSAURS. I admit mental illness has no path of success. Even I want to give up to pray for a new one cause im getting old. If I could live forever I would cause dying isnt going to get better.

the push that'll bring me to rest. 

But it never came.",0
"Don't mind the grammar. I'm Dutch.

**Don't read if you are easily triggered. I don't want any of you feel bad/worse.**

Okay, some of you already start typing reasons to stay alive. Y'all are so kind for doing that. I miss kind people. Everyone leaves me 'cuz I'm depressed. And everytime I'm in my deepest point of a 'depression wave', somebody dies. Like life also tries to convince me I should kill myself.

So I heard in August I could go to a mental hospital in MARCH. So at that point it sounded so far away that I gave up and neglected myself. Cuz everyday was hell. And I was supposed to wait 6 months. **But** of course I was thankfull my psychiatrist got me on the list of the mental hospital that is specialised in autism. So I was too scared to really tell I wouldn't survive until then.

I've been severe depressed in october. Didn't really come out of my room except for diner or to go to the toilet. Selfharmed the whole day long, slept when I was tired, not on a certain time so my sleep rythm was ruined. Gained weight. Couldn't concentrate on anything. Like I was in my mind already fading away. I became sure life was giving my signs that I should die. Everything that could go wrong, DID go wrong. And in my deepest point, my grandma died. I still haven't accept it. Her death didn't feel real for days. It was on the funeral where it felt like life punched me in the head. The amount of emotions were so much that I tried to not be in the reality anymore. Thinking about an alternate life. Writing stories and imagining me in it constantly.

I think that last thing gave me a depersonalisation disorder or something. I don't know how it works and I know I can't diagnose myself. But on moments where I have a lot of emotions or when I'm a little stressed, I feel like I'm watching my body experiencing things. Like I'm the coÃ¶rdinator in my head watching through my eyes. I can't really talk or think cuz I feel like my body should talk or think in that situation. I'm just watching what happens and take decisions.

And then late October... I was standing on the edge of the bridge and decided to talk to an old friend, instead of jumping at that moment. (She has DID, and one of her personalities is an agressive one who made me dissociate when she wanted me to kms). You can say she's a bad influence, but she's the only one still standing by me and the only one with the same kind of humor. She has help so the thing that happened last year won't happen again.

Anyway, I became a little happier, started enjoying going outside again. I made friends in a therian community cuz I figured back in August I was a therian too. (whatever your opinion is about 'therians', pls dont post them here cuz this isnt what the post is about)

Idk why, but I knew I was going into a depressed moment again, as I was irritated everyday and selfharming again.... So I landed in the depressed wave again. Or should I say drowning? I don't enjoy anything, every food tastes boring. I can't sleep cuz I cry every damn night. I'm constantly thinking about kms. I'm even trying it, or sort of searching boundaries. Taking pills but just enough to still stay alive. Or standing on the edge of the bridge but not jump.

What triggered my to write this post, was because I heard a cat of mine has cancer and he may not survive another week. The cat that shoved his fur in my face :') so I got a little distracted in a traumatising situation which happened 2/3 years ago. (Can't talk about it now cuz PTSD flashbacks will kill me with this amount of emotions I have now) The cat that walks over my legs, jumps in my neck and demands attention when I'm crying on the floor in the middle of the night. He is like my ESA (not official one) And I'm about to lose him. I can't go through this. I can't lose the last string of the rope that I'm holding on the edge of a ravine. I feel like kms at the moment. I don't wanna die. I wanna be of this pain.

About the mental hospital in march? 18 days until an apointment to talk about practical stuff. then I have to wait another week (I guess?) to finally be there and be save from myself.

But plz give me some strenght, some advice. I know I need to hold on these last weeks, but I can't. Every minute of everyday is torture. I don't think I'll survive until then.",3
"Why can't I do what I need to do? I remember telling my final therapist how I'd sit paralyzed while my mind screamed at me to do things, and she said I just had to do them. 

It was one of those things I've been told that stings to this very day. Is this paralysis some internal weakness that I do have control over? If so, how the hell does this work because I can't figure it out?

I wouldn't have gone to see someone if I'd have known they'd told me what they did. I came to them for help. Was what they gave me the only help there is? Is this my fault? Or do I even have a choice being like this?",3
"a year ago i had really bad anorexia, i lost 50lbs in 2 months and i wish i never stopped. i hate myself so much. i just want to be perfect so bad but i feel like this is how ill live my life now. i just dont want my cats to suffer, its the only reason i do anything. i lost all my interests in everything but i hate doing nothing and i just want to go away. please let me go away.",3
Yea. I'm ready for the â€œyou're just a kidâ€. Idgaf. I want to go. My mind and body is screaming for a way out of this fucking horrible mindset of myn. Im a dumbfucking stoner with a stepdad who literally makes me fear to go downstairs. I sit in my room all day and hope that I just fucking die. My mom Dosent fucking care jack shit about me. My step dad gets pissed off over nothing. And leaves for 8 months. And I swear by this saying those 8 months are the happiest months I ever have. My stepfather almost choked his father out when he was 16 and said he wishes he did it. Which makes me scared to say anything to him. My mother knows I don't like him and don't like being near him but she Dosent care. I was bullied for nearly my whole elementary school years and I was having suicidal thought from the start of grade 3 or 4. And that's just not okay in the eyes of anybody. I currently just took 10 pills and hoping I black out. I have one friend. Who I made when I was forced to move back to my old house. Him and I bonded over stupid and racist shit. And now he's like a brother to me. I wish he didn't have to put up with my bullshit. I love him like a brother and all. But I feel that he would get over it soon enough. I feel bad for people who have to deal with me. And I just want all this pain and suffering of my day to day to fucking end. I want me to end. I want everything to fucking end.,4
"i feel like am faling apart like worses then back i also feel like im losing myself tha makes me feel so weird and empty i just want to end it it al get so worse those feelingn that i started cutting while i made a promise to my friend i would never do it again i feel so depressed al i can do is wait til it gets better and pretend im al right even tough its hard somtimes ik i wil get trough it music also helps me alot and im realy thankful for the people who try to help me on the otherside i dont need there help i can do it on my own... i feel realy weird and bad for lying to everyone about how i feel but somtimes its just better not to tel the truth but then later on when you wanna tell the truth it only gets worser im so scared to tel my parents and im also scare that they wont understand it so i better dont tel them i dont wnat to give them more worries then they already have. i feel so wothless i can do nothing right i fail al my math test and then they say ""study more"" while i study 16 hours my parents are also a lil disappointed in me cuz i dont have good grades but if they would only know whats wrong with my mind they would react different im sure but im just to scared to tel them i dont wanna let them down but i feel like am already doing it... life is not what i tought it was.. i was so dumb to think that life was easy...",4
"I don't think I'm depressed. Not really sure how it works, but I'm kind of done If that makes any sense. 

This past semester of school has just been, weird, any time I get an assignment I feel overwhelmed, even though it's no different from any previous semester. I failed my first math test, I haven't started my senior project, behind in everything else. I want to get caught up, but I just have no desire to do anything. I live at home (community college) and have a life I'm sure many others would kill for, but still. 

As cringe as it sounds, I've been pointing our .357 at my skull and dry firing it. I hate the idea of my family and friends having to deal with the fallout, but I really can't see a future for myself. 

I'm not going to do anything but I thought I post because why not.",2
"I'm 22. I grew up in an emotionally, verbally, and occasionally physically abusive home. My dad became an alcoholic as a result of the bias from my mom. I became the unwilling referee and parental therapist as a preteen and eventual side punching bag as a teen. My mom has tried to kill me a few times now - some before I was 18, some after, and also kidnapped me as a child after she and my dad had a fight. I spent all of my adolescence waiting for a chance to get out. CPS came twice but nothing ever helped. I got into a dream school and everything as a senior, but that got ripped away too. Mom refused to sign off on loans - which I could not get without a co-signer. There went my escape. 

They divorced. I became the physical punching bag for my mom. I cut my hair off to prevent her from grabbing it. My dad got worse. I tried to kill myself a few times, all of which failed for some reason or another. Got 51/50'd. My mom proceeded to use that as a threat from then on of where she could send me if I didn't behave. I stayed with my dad after that, and cut her off. Still was depressed as fuck though. Only person I could talk to about any of it was my grandma. One night talked to her and my aunt (who's racist and hates me) happened to also be there. She took the phone and screamed at me. Told me never to call my grandma again, told me to stop making up shit about my family and stop talking suicide to an elder. My grandma could handle it, she used to feel that way too - it's why I could talk to her about it. 

Fast forward a little bit and my dad (just after we finally patched our relationship and things looked better) suddenly died from his drinking problem. I had to go back to my mom because no other relative was an option. My mom immediately took it out on me, and I became terrified to even wake up. She tried to smother me to death, tried to choke me out with an aux cord, tried to shove me down the stairs, tried to push me out of a moving vehicle, etc. Yet every time blamed me. It was the worst year of my life, or so I thought. At least I had my grandma. She was depressed too, over losing her son, and because she was being biasd by her daughter (the racist aunt). I was trying to help but it always got covered up somehow. Then exactly one year later, my grandma suddenly died. But she left me half her estate to protect myself, because she wanted me to move out and live near her. She was the only person left that wanted to help me. 

But then my aunt (the one from before) got hissy about the fact that her mom and I were closer than they ever were, and she lawyered up. She refused to give me a key, refused to give me the items my grandma specifically wanted me to have (because no proof), and informed me of the sale well after it happened while I was out of state. She also kept going through my mom, which was idiotic - as my parents divorced and I was an adult. I asked her about it, she dodged, so I wrote a letter. She never contacted me again for months, so I had to get an attorney (that I can't afford tbh) and we've been back and forth on that since. Now she's threatening to file the taxes under my name without my permission without my SSN so the IRS comes after me. All this over fucking recipe cards and a desk! 

I always think about wanting to end it, end the pain, end the inevitable suffering that always comes, but I can't. I can't leave my cats. I refuse to rehome, the word itself hurts me to even type or see. How could I do such a thing to my family? The only ones there for me? Anytime I cry they sit on me and purr or lick my face and one of them legit meows at me until i talk to her and she keeps meowing till i'm done and then snuggles. They are literally the closest to me and the only ones that keep me going. I just wish I could do something for them too (like find a new place to live, but I can't). My mom recently made credit cards under my name and maxed them out. Told me this just so ""I'd understand the position I'm in."" If anyone asks her she says it's just to help me build my credit. To which I'm sure is somewhat true, because she intends to sign my name off as a cosigner to a property she wants to buy. 

To her I've only ever been a means to an end. I just want out, I don't want to die. I want a place on my own with my cats, safe and sound. But I feel like I'll never get out. And I'm afraid to wish too because everytime I do I get something worse.",4

"I just want to be happy. I haven't been happy for the last four years. The last time I felt that sensation in my brain was my freshman year of college. I was talking to a girl and I could feel the dopamine in my head. That was the last time I felt happy. I've been chasing that feeling ever since. The friends have helped make me feel whole. When I'm alone I don't know what do. I repressed these feelings for a long time. I started watching Bojack Horseman and the feelings came back. Am I a whole person? Am I took messed up too feel love again? I ask myself this every day. When I'm drunk I am able to let these feelings out. I don't want to be dependent on alcohol to feel this way. I want to talk about my feelings, but I don't want to be less of a man. Jessica has made me decently happy, but I still don't feel this way. I don't want to be dependant on her either. When I beat off I only can finish when I think about personal emotions. I can't even cry anymore. What does that mean? Am I better? I don't have decency on alcohol. I have stopped for a while and I still feel this way. I don't know if it is because I'm lonely or because of how messed up I am. When your mother tells you that you should have been a miscarriage you reevaluate life. At the age of thirteen. Is that really an age when you should be questioning your existence? I don't want pity, I just want to feel normal. When I look at myself I question my life. I have accepted death, but I have also noticed the finite life you have. Once you live, you die. That is scary to me. I just want to cry, but even while writing this I can't. There are people worse than me, but the way I think about it is, have wasted my life? College is full of life. I haven't lived one. I wish I was dumb and could fade into the crowd, but I can't. All I think about is my deathbed and how it won't be anything. I die and that is it. I'm gone. In high school, I had the same thoughts, but my stepmom said that I'm young and I don't understand. I find myself having the same thoughts. Maybe nonexistence is fine. I just want to lay in bed and drift away with my mind until I do die. I'm afraid of the loss of thought. Once you're gone your gone. Nothingness. I'm scared. I just want that feeling one more time, but how does happiness happen? Relationship, family, or accomplishment? The future scares me and I don't want to sit here on shitty earth and have these feelings at fifty. How do people become happy? I've lost the feeling and don't know how to get it back. Once we die that is it. Am I going to die and feel nothing? Is a relationship enough? Or am I broken? I almost want to pass away not think. What does it all mean? Are we just bacteria that evolved enough to think? I want answers, but nobody will tell me.",4

I don't know if I need meds because apparently I show signs of willingness so I don't need them. I'm pissed that I am consumed by chronic sadness every day and night, 24/7. I'm also pissed that I have no supportive people besides my parents and cousin. Perhaps I'm ungrateful. I'd rather end it all tbh. Nothing in this life is exciting and at 21, life should be fun, exciting, wild, laid-back, etc. As a young woman, I should be excited for what's to come. I should be excited for having a wonderful life but I am not. I absolutely hate my self and my life. Nothing is helping, not even talking to others.

"I had been doing so well for months and everything has come back full circle, if not worse. This move was supposed to be great for the both of us. More money and better opportunity for him. Getting away from all the bad stuff in our old town and new opportunities for me. But, everything is not how we would hoped it would be. Money is even tighter than before. I don't know how he's going to make his car payment, or pay for internet, or rent. Even make the trip back to see his parents this weekend. Nothing we do seems to be enough or even matter.

I am beyond stressed. I'm barely sleeping anymore, I just can't shut off my mind. All the thoughts racing back and forth in my mind of the things that I should be doing instead of sleeping. Like cleaning, finding a better job or a second job. I lay awake stressing about how to help more when I feel like everything I do now isn't enough, and I'm just waiting for everything to come crashing down. 

Yet, on the other hand, I am ANGRY. I'm angry that I'm getting no help from him. I do all the household chores amidst his claims every day of ""after work I'll come home and clean"". It's my paycheck and any extra cash I get a hold of that is immediately spent on bills because his check wasn't enough because sales were down the last month, or was spent on game passes and subscriptions for games. I was the one who drove there and back to go do his errands while he was sitting on the beach in Mexico with his friends. 

And I. Feel. Terrible. 

I'm right back to being sucked into this numbness, this darkness. All I want again is to just not wake up in the morning. To have everything just be over. The thoughts of suicide and self harm are back in full force and the only reason I haven't harmed, is because I simply don't have a razor blade in the house...

There have been elements of bias in the past and I dont think I can fully trust anyone, so I have to do this or die or get a high paying job without a degree or hurting my back(I have a terrible back and neurological problems) I'll be left with something like stripping, or just suicide.

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, classes are getting more intense, I'm already behind in an online class that posted no deadlines, because I'm prioritizing a class in which I work around 30 hours/week to keep my quality high(I'm aiming for A's and this class is supposedly graded harshly-so far I have A's and 1 B on something I worked on for just 10 hours). Anyway, so I am behind in my online classes now, trying to make time to catch up, but seems impossible. 

&amp;nbsp;

My other in person class doesn't take as much time, I have a 4 hour studio and homework takes me maybe 1-5 hours usually. I have trouble managing time because I hardly see my SO, so when we do see each other, we stay up late and just play games. We havent had any intimacy in about a month, and otherwise it's like a 1-2x/month thing. He doesn't help me with the chores unless I ask a bunch of times even though i made a chore chart for us both to look at,on the fridge, and gave myself more things. He keeps promising he'll do chores,shower,brush his teeth, just basic things, and he doesn't. He actually said he'd do all the chores when I went back to school(like I'd done for him) and not to worry. I worried, but I left things for a bit and realized I was correct in being concerned after the house started looking trashed. If I talk to him he changes the topic or recites some meme. He kisses me maybe twice a day and is otherwise glued to his phone watching YouTube videos- he quit video games as they were time consuming but just switched to videos instead. He's so addicted to his phone that he got his by a bus last year, while I was passenger. He's usually on his phone while driving and there's nothing I can do. I dont drive because of my anxiety, and I dont have a working car. I am very stressed right now and feel totally alone. 
&amp;nbsp;

I literally dont have time to see a therapist. I dont even have time to see my doctors for checkups. All I do is work, at school,homework,and at home. I am painfully shy and awkward and have no friends. I've joined a few clubs to make friends but it seems impossible; people try to befriend me it seems, and I just don't know how to interact. I had an amazing conversation with another top performer in my class with the difficult work and anticipated becoming friends- she tries, but I dont know how to reciprocate and I can tell that I make things uncomfortable because I react as if we never started forming a friendship, if that makes sense. 

&amp;nbsp;

In my other class there is one kid who has tried to befriend me. He has autism and comes across pretty brash. I try to remind myself that he has a condition and to not take things personally, but sometimes I can't help it and I feel terrible and other times he is just too close and I feel awkward. I think he seems genuinely friendly and most of the time I dont mind him, but I guess I'm just under so much stress at this point that everything is getting to me. The whole class is also pretty distracting, which again, is usually bearable but the stress is wearing me out and there's 0 things I can do to relieve it.

&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday I got a grade back from a quiz and just a friendly note to try to speak up more during critique(I'm a design student, so this is an art class). I made a mental note to make sure to speak up during critique last night, and then I panicked. First I panicked because I wanted to be done my painting beforehand- I hadn't planned properly and am always the slow one in everything, so I kept messing up and didn't finish in time. It seemed I was one of 2 others who hadn't finished so that made me feel a little better. Critique came and the aforementioned kid stood next to me as he always does, uncomfortably close, and then in front of me and I couldn't see the paintings. Panic increased and I didn't want to be rude so I didn't say anything. I planned for what shouldve been my painting for critique and was called out of order and further panicked. 
&amp;nbsp;

I have a disorder that causes dissociation under stress and I have social anxiety. So when I panic, my mind goes blank. This happened a few days ago; my dog is unfortunately aggressive with 1 dog in my neighborhood. She is a strong dog and fortunately until this point, it had only been my bf who had experienced this. She lunged at the dog and I wasnt strong enough to pull her back, I panicked,mind went blank, and I just stood there. In my mind, the only thing i could think was like, the idea or feeling of alarm, but I couldn't speak or move. The neighbor didn't seem to mind and gave the dogs treats, but I felt so terrible. I don't know how to fix this.

&amp;nbsp;

During the critique, my mind was blank and I didn't know what to say. I absorbed things others had said, but my mind flushed them out when I tried to speak. Speaking and thinking at the same time is difficult for me. I guess I'm just stupid. I usually think for a long time before I speak, and I can think and write, but I dont know how to think+speak quickly or at once. I just felt like crying and couldn't wait to just pack up and start on my drawing assignment(until I realized I'd forgotten my most important supplies).

&amp;nbsp;

I grew up with abusive parents. My dad was pretty absent, working a lot, but when he was home he was a complete ass. He would constantly provoke me. My older brother harshly picked on me. My mom did the most damage, somehow. I grew up thinking she was ""good cop"", she taught me to think that. She could do no wrong, she was perfect, she was always right. If she was upset with me, even if seemingly unreasonable, I did mental gymnastics with myself to justify it. Example: I didn't intervene in her argument with my dad over finances which 6 year old me didn't understand? I'm a bad person who doesn't love mom. 
Moms in the bathroom the 8th time this week with razor blades? I'd be her psychiatrist and beg her to come out,reason with her why she should. Eventually I realized I didn't have to say anything. Eventually still, I realized that I could probably leave because she would just come out soon anyway. I did once, around 6 or 7 and I guess she talked and I didn't respond, so she came literally running after me, cornered me, and yelled down at me for not loving her.
&amp;nbsp;
I have an eating disorder? 
I'm ""evil"", I'm a ""dirty slut"" even though I'm not allowed out of the house- this must be because of how I look or something I've done- am I that person? Mom says so, so i guess so. 
&amp;nbsp;
As a young child, I was mostly raised by my grandparents nextdoor and would sleep over at their house often. I'd cry myself to sleep every night because I thought my mom was mad at me. Every day, I'd be to blame for something. Once, I even got blamed for my dad losing $100. I don't even know why. My mom yelled from up at our back door to down at the yard at me, with the neighborhood kids all outside, telling me I'd better bring the $100 back right now. So then my friends assumed I was a thief(cause a 9 y/o who can't drive and never goes anywhere has a reason for money is definitely wont get caught with random money at some point ðŸ™„). 

&amp;nbsp;

At some point, around 9, I started self harming because I didn't understand what I had apparently done. I was upset for always being such an apparent major cause of my mother's pain- the person I did love most in the world no matter what she thought.

&amp;nbsp;

My parents destroyed my education as an ongoing argument for the funsies I guess. I planned to graduate at 15 or 16 and GTFO. I was physically bullied at school to the point of having my arms near broken every day. I begged to be homeschooled- my plan was to be able to focus on my schooling without bullies and graduate early to get away from my family. I was in 2nd grade my first year homeschooling and skipped up to grade 5 work in everything but math, which I got up to maybe grade 3 which was equivalent to my current grade in public school work. My parents would argue about public and homeschooling and switch me back and forth at least once a school semester. So I'd be in public school in august for a few months, then homeschooled. Obviously this ruined my extra work I'd done and I became discouraged. In 7th grade, I began having a lot of trouble with math. My mom refused to help me, saying I had learning disability and just couldn't learn so to not do it(and then help my lovely, psychotic step sister instead). She'd do this to me at public school too, and I'd often go in humiliated having to explain that I couldn't finish my homework. 

&amp;nbsp;

At one point, I wasn't allowed outside(my grandparents had moved in) and due to that and all the stress, I embraced being reclusive. I told myself I wanted to be that way and whenever people would think it was odd, my mom would huff back at them before I could speak, saying that not everyone has to have friends.

&amp;nbsp;

And now I'm this. Looking back, I remember my dad telling me that my mom coddled me too much and kept me from other people, wanting me all to herself. At the time I thought it was ridiculous, but now I see he was right; she needed me to soothe her, to blame for everything, to be there in misery with her. 
&amp;nbsp;

I got older, decided that I wanted to try being social, so I'd say yes to every single opportunity. Every one. That was a terrible idea and I ended up being biasd by a few predatory opportunists, which in turn caused me major anxiety, more than ever before, and I became more reclusive than ever before. I havent held a stable job in a while. Havent had friends since that time, about 10 years ago. I've been with my SO, who has been abusive off and on. Things were great for a few years until we moved out a few years ago, and now they've been very off and on. For a few years again, things have been pretty good as far as that goes, but obviously not having time and not feeling effort from the other person feels shitty too. 

&amp;nbsp;

A couple years ago I found myself in a terrible situation with him and decided my options were prostitution, stripping, drugs, or suicide. I mass applied to jobs but when I'd receive a response, I was never qualified for anything but retail which I've had bad experiences with and it doesn't pay enough. I stopped eating, became an alcoholic with the little funds I had, and attempted suicide somewhere near 3 times a week on average for a few months straight. I almost succeeded once and then my bf unexpectedly came home early and I was sent to the hospital. Things didn't get better when I got out, I threw away my antidepressants since my feelings felt inappropriate in relation to my thoughts and situation, and resumed weekly attempts. Otherwise I'd just lie in bed and try not to get up for fear of killing myself.

&amp;nbsp;

2017 and 2018 sucked. Last year got a little better and by the end of the year I decided to go back to school. I decided rather abruptly and didn't have time to seek diagnosis for learning disabilities, which I think I obviously have. I have a diagnosis of anxiety disorders and recurrent major depressive disorder but I've assumed I wouldn't receive any accommodations for those because.. what can be done?

&amp;nbsp;

Instead I've tried plowing through my feelings and intentionally making myself uncomfortable by joining clubs and going to campus in person, but I'm not adjusting as quickly as I'd hoped. And in the real world, I will have to talk, I will have to have social skills. No one cares about you in the real world. I'm old and have already exposed myself to that in the many job fields I've attempted, so I'm aware. 

&amp;nbsp;

I just feel like I'm a failure. And now I'm overloading myself and I dont want to back down, but idk how to deal with everything and get no help, and have nothing outside of school and working at home. I need a good balance, but I have literally no way of making that happen. I'm in a club that meets once a week, the paper which is 1x a month, and now a new club that no one showed up for, so I became club leader. This will force me into social situations, and I hope that I can do it. In my head I'm telling myself to just do it, so I try, and I talk, and garbage comes out. And I'm older than everyone else, so it's awkward. I'm not supposed to be so immature and stupid by social standards. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like I'm just not going to make it. I have straight A's but I feel like I don't deserve them. My art never looks good to me even after spending hours working. I need to make this work but I dont know how. I dont know how to change who I've been for 29 years, in an instant, but I desperately want to. I want to be different, I dont want to be who I am anymore. In the meantime, I'm trying to squeeze in time with my SO and getting very little sleep. Most of it is just time in the same room not even interacting or talking or anything and I feel really void of any affection and social interaction right now, as well as anything fun. I used to walk every day- it's something that lessens the frequency of nerve pain and I dont even have time for that. The weather has been shit anyway. I dont find gaming fun, I don't like to sit, but that's all I'm doing. I'm exhausted. 

&amp;nbsp;

I dont even know what I'm getting at anymore with this. I'm just frustrated with life. Everything is dull,I'm over stressed,lonely, and I honestly just hate myself. Everything about myself is awful, I really hate who I am. I became really sick in the first few weeks of school and have had bronchitis for about 3-4 weeks. It's getting better but I feel like that happening really fucked a lot up for me since I had no energy. I dont know how to manage everything or how to socialize. I feel like I should just kill myself but I dont know how to even do it properly in a way that wont be totally awful. I'm looking to get away from pain and if the last minutes of my life could at least be peaceful that would be, well, ideal. I really wish assisted suicide for chronically suicidal people was a thing sometimes.",2
"My sadness has been dragging me for weeks and today, I'm too lazy to do the things I normally do. Even the things that I want to do. I wasn't able to go to school today because it was really hard to get out of my bed. I'm not even in the mood to play games. Every minor thing that bums me out affects me drastically.

I haven't tried going to the hospital regarding my mental health and I am not sure if this is all just in my head or I really have depression.",1
"I've lost the fight.

I'm nothing at this point. A ball of emotions, barely fucking human. I've lost my motivation to go on. I'm not even pushing back against the destruction my brain wrecks. I'm not special, unique, important, smart, helpful, or human in any sense. I'm a selfish, lying bastard piece of shit. I'm insignificant, the background man. I'm not who I am. I'm a fake. A fake built up to conceal the blackness and horrible person I really am. I can't be happy ever again, everything I put on is just a mask to hide the nothingness. 

Nobody needs me. I don't have a life to take at this point. I'm numb, and I can't feel it anymore. I'm tired of waiting, fighting, disguising, and trying. I'm losing, and there's nothing I can do to win. 

There is no end. I doubt I find solace in anything.",1
"These past two years have been such a letdown for how little I've gotten done. But even worse, who I thought I was turned our to be wrong. I need purpouse. I need the story of my life to, for one actually read like a story, and to have a meaning. I have absolutely no clue how to live without that emotional connection to who I am and the pride that comes with that.",5
"I hate myself and am gonna kill myself. Probably. I say that a lot to people I know and I'm always serious but never do it because I'm scared amd want it to be better. It's not gonna be better.
I'm hurting the people I like amd love every day by existing so I'll stop this.
I hit my best friend kinda on accident and he hates me now. I don't have any friends anymore.
My family is shit. Just laughing at me failing life.
I'm failing at life and school.
It's not gonna change anything for people who know me if I die now. Goodbye.... Hopefully",4
"At the end of last July, a boy I thought I liked had a party at my house. I got drunker than I ever have in my life and I kind of got taken advantage of, and I really think about it a lot. How could this person that I thought was my friend let this happen to me? Why is it that everyone was mad at me for crying about it after it happened, why did everyone tell me I was making a scene, telling me I was making it a bigger deal than it really was. I've carried this ever since it happened and I can't make it go away, I can't stop thinking about it.

My family is moving out of that house now and I found a pile of the boy's shit that they all left at my house that night. I threw it all away and it didn't make me feel any better, it just made me wonder why I still had it. It dragged up a lot of bad stuff for me and I can't get this off of my mind so I'm sharing it here now. Maybe this isn't the right place for this story, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry for a lot of things. I don't even know who I'm the most mad at at. I think it's me. I don't know why I let this happen to me.",4
"I have a stutter and after learning that I wont grow out of it, I feel as if I would never achieve my dreams due go my lack of ability to fluently speak. It's making me feel worthless. I know that I will never get a girlfriend because of it and it just makes me feel like shit.",2
That's just it. I don't want to live my life anymore. The only stopping me is my family. I have really have nothing to live for. My life is a total and complete shit show.,4
This is my personal experience. But seeing other people go through the same struggles I go through is kinda calming. And some people are obviously going through things much worse. Also people here are so much more sympathetic and kind. It's wonderful.,0
"What started as a week phase(on and off) in September of 2019 has slowly becoming more and more permanent. My eyes feel tired, I feel physically exhausted. I can't focus, I can't find enjoyment out of guitar and video games (things I used to put hours a day into). So now I sleep. I sleep in my free periods at school and I sleep when I get home at 2:30pm. I wake up around 8pm, eat and go back to bed. My dreams are starting to be better then my own life. While I dream I feel happy, I don't feel weighed down. I don't feel like I'm alone. I don't feel numb. 

I went to the school counselor for help last week. All she told me was to tell my mom how I was feeling and go see a doctor. That is the hardest thing I can possibly do. She will think it's her fault, similar to how she took my sisters anxiety problem, and I can't burden that on her. I don't know what to do.

Edit: grammar",5
"I have been bullied and told I was playing the victim card my entire life, nobody wants me to live so why am I still here? I will never find a boyfriend or girlfriend and being broken with a useless set of cards keeps me from being even slightly successful. 

The American dream is specifically made to benefit the wealthy and powerful. The poor will not make it in this country, suicide rates are already rising and have been for the past 20 years. I try playing games but nothing is entertaining anymore especially when I do everything alone with no visible future.

I am literally just living until I am not able to support myself and then I will either die by natural causes or suicide. It feels like nobody wants to support me and I was dealt a useless set of cards from the beginning.",1
"I think about suicide all the time. I am sooooo broke, depressed, and now live in my car even though I work a full time job and do side gigs. I am my grandmothers sponsor therefore I'm financially responsible for her. It's the only reason I'm alive. If I was gone, no one would be pay for her assisted living or even watch out for her. I love her and resent her. I've been thinking about suicide ever since I can remember. I don't even remember the last time I was actually even semi happy but I'm stuck because I love her. 

If this wasn't the case and I actually had some money, I'd go far far away. Somewhere like Tuvalu where people actually seem to care about each other. Where life moves slow and not everything involves so much technology and material things. I think that'd be the one thing that could help me with my suicidal thoughts.. just completely changing my life. 

But I can't do that, so if you have the means to do so, why don't you try? Don't move to a different city.. move to a different continent. If you are planning to kill yourself, move somewhere else. Change everything. You have nothing to lose and maybe just maybe you'll actually be happy to Alive and if so, I'd love to live vicariously through you.",2

"i was perfectly fine until about 9pm last night (i randomly started crying out of nowhere as i was watching a perfectly normal youtube video, although i've forgotten what it was about, but it wasn't anything upsetting or triggering).

so i go to sleep at about 10ish and assume that i'll be better when i wake up, but i was wrong. i woke up still depressed and crying again, not wanting to get out of bed or do anything, let alone go to uni and do my work/study. i get up and get ready (although this felt like it took an eternity to do), and go to uni for a while, but i found it really overwhelming. i don't remember what else happened, but i decided to go back home (student flat) and try to take my mind off work even though i can't because the deadlines are coming pretty fast.

to think that i was full of energy and ideas 2 days ago is beyond me since i've barely had the energy to get out of bed this morning. i also don't have the energy to cry anymore, so now i'm just empty and wanting to die. also this post doesn't really make much sense, but i'm super depressed and empty that i feel like i can't function anymore",5
"I'm a mid-20s woman with rapid-cycling bipolar II but I'm posting here because I'm asking about antidepressants and how to control my depressive episodes.

My moods were under control when I was on lithium and zoloft, but the zoloft (50 mg, so not much) absolutely ZAPPED my sex drive. I would force myself to do it to please my partner (no, he did not coerce me). Aside from that, I felt the best I'd ever felt. No complaints otherwise.

Last June, I went off the zoloft and stuck with the lithium and felt fine, but I felt some depression symptoms coming back after a couple months. My anxiety and reactivity increased, but I was still WAY better off than with no meds whatsoever.

In December, my psychiatrist recommended an NDRI to help prevent a change in libido. I started wellbutrin (100 mg so again, not much) and it was definitely helping, but now I'm feeling some depression symptoms coming back again. I have spent the last week thinking I'm stupid and pathetic and useless for no apparent reason. My psychiatrist thinks I did better on an SSRI, but the lack of libido was awful and not something I ever want to experience again. I know that particular symptom varies from person to person, so I wanted to know about others' experiences with those classes of antidepressants and if symptoms varied from drug to drug, even within the same class.",3

"Last night was hard. Harder than the rest. I won't lie, all my feelings of death were enhanced when I saw that my eÃ—, my first and only love, have the time of his life with someone else. I was drunk and sure I wanted to die. So I told a friend and she was sad, but I reassured her I wasnt going to do anything. When I went home to my apartment, I took a handful of ibuprofen pills and went to sleep. I probably should have taken more because I'm awake typing this. I know it's stupid to think I could overdose on ibuprofen, but I didn't have anything else. I'm so disappointed that I woke up this morning and saw a text from me ex, essentially saying that he has been over me for almost a year and that he was happy now and he was over it. Him telling me to get over it. The reason I want to die isn't because of him. However, knowing that whatever feelings I felt of love were unrequited, just makes me wish I wasn't alive to see it. I wish it was my last message. I wish it worked somehow. I'm just so tired of living my life, but there's no real way to end it. I'm trapped.

Tonight I let my dog out and I saw a package on my doorstep and it was from a couple of friends that I haven't spoken to in a couple months who were worried about me. A bunch of doctor who stuff and star trek socks, literally everything that I would love. I cried when I opened it. I become so convinced that I'm worthless and I'm horrible to be around and I stop talking with people who actually care about me. I called them instantly and they weren't even mad that I haven't talked to them in so long. I wish I could tell them how much it means to me but I'm afraid to let people know that I've been suicidal because I don't want them to be worried.

This month I've got the rent covered but now don't have enough money for the power bill, my car payment, and my car insurance ad again I'm left panicking and stressing about where I'm going to get the money and what's going to happen. I'm starting a new job in three weeks but that doesn't help me right now. It's so depressing and I honestly feel like killing myself sometimes over it. I wake up dreading what the day holds and it's horrible. My parents don't believe me when I tell them I'm depressed and won't help me with money because they think I should learn through struggling.

"Hi everyone,

For the first time EVER I am going to speak to someone tomorrow about my suicidal ideation, which has plagued me for 10 years. 

I'm currently at uni, and booked an appointment with a student support officer from my school. She's not a counsellor, but can deal with academic issues (which I'm having because of the big sad), and refer students onto mental health services.

I'm absolutely shit scared. I've never really spoken to anyone about how I feel, only a couple of times drunkenly to a few friends (who've never brought it up again). I just feel like it's time because things have gotten worse recently, and I'll be graduating this summer which is terrifying. 

I'm not really sure where to start with the meeting, or about what I should say? I've never met her before, I just emailed to book a meeting.

Let me know if this is the wrong sub. I'm basically just wanting to know how to start the conversation and how much detail to go into. It feels way too intense to just sit down and be like hi nice to meet you I think about killing myself every day and have a pile of suicide notes on my desk. I also don't want to be sectioned lol.",2

Most people don't want me around. I'm not desirable in any way. I'm not exciting. What I have to offer other people, like kindness, love, compassion, are outdated concepts.

"I don't know if it's the anxeity disorder or what, but lately I've been thinking for some reason that my life is gonna be short and end with a tragic and traumatic death.

"Hi guys,

it is the first time that I write on this sub and it is also one of my first posts but honestly I feel myself sinking and maybe writing about it will help me. By the way I'm Italian so forgive me in advance for my English.

I'm a 20M and I've been suffering depression for 5 years now, before I thought it was adolescent sadness and I have never given it too much weight. But after two path of psychoanalysis with two different psychotherapists I was diagnosed the ""thing"".

I'm struggling every day with suicidal thoughts and the situation is going worst cause the situation in my home is terrible, I live with my grandma (who also suffers of depression and take Xanax and prozac every day) my mother who is a strong career woman but she uses me as her personal therapist since I remember and my little brother who is my only light in this house. My father works in another city and I don't see him that much. In the last six month my father said to my mother he don't love anymore her and there is another woman. I don't judge him, who am I to do it? But now I've always my mum emotionally destroyed that reach for my help, but I don't know how to help her and more the time goes on more I can't talk with my dad normally.

I tried to escape from this situation in October moving away in another city, I thought I need to live alone and away from that house, but the depression strikes hard on me and I had to return in my original home to afford to return in therapy.

Currently the situation is becoming uncontrollable, even my friends have noticed it, I've always been very good at hiding my problems, and one of the last evenings they have made me a sort of intervention for my drinking problem. I honestly reveal them that I don't have suicidal thoughts only when I drink.

I hate my self so much, I'm known in my city for my drunken adventures and I don't like it but the thought of stop drinking kills me.

I don't know what to do, I don't see a light at the bottom of the tunnel.",4

"What do u do when you're in a dark place?
I'm married, I have one kid, dog, cat, house to clean.
I'm sick rn (just cold, but I have UC, so it's worse for us). Last yeah I was in hospital 5 times. This year one. All. Because of stupid UC. I hate myself, I hate how I look. I don't feel any support or love from anyone in my life except my little daughter. She's the only reason I don't commit suicide. I don't have strength anymore. There are plans to have 3 surgeries in near future. One of them is gastric sleeve - because I can't get rid of the weight because if the medicine I use, I feel ugly and fat. I miss the lovely feeling u get from first kisses, from love, excitement, happiness. It's just... My life is dark rn. I think about suicide alot, I've told my husband, mom (who doesn't belive clinical depression is a real thing), my therapist (who has a hard time with me, because I'm a stubborn little Satan). I don't know what to do... I know where I can get sleeping pills, so I'm just afraid my daughter will loose her mother soon.
And I'm in Norway, I'm afraid of telling doctors about my suicide thoughts because here they are really happy to take away child from your family for every little shit. I don't know what to do. I'm done with this whole life and shit. I have pain in my whole body and I don't have any pain relief meds (because Norway only gives you paracetamol fuckery).",1
"At the end of March if things still aren't better, I'm just gonna take the whole bottle of acetaminophen in the kitchen before school. If it doesn't kill me, then my parents will know I'm suicidal, and if does then I'll be dead! It's a win-win either way.

I would stay home from school, but I feel like that would arouse suspicion. If I start feeling the effects around lunch and don't want to go back to school so they don't figure it out, then I'll just drive to a Walmart parking lot or something.

Sure, I'll be missing graduation and prom and all those super important high school things... but at this point I don't care. I see no point in continuing to live. We've already lost 5 students this year so I kind of feel bad that I'm going to subject my school to more grief but only like 10 people know me well so it won't hurt that much.",2
I am so done. I literally am out of energy to give and everything is going to shit again. I feel like I can't breathe and I really don't have the energy to fight again. I just want to sleep and never wake up.,5
"I really don't know if this is the appropriate sub-reddit for this but I find it really funny when I become suicidal. 

The intent to kill myself is very strong and it reaches the point that it creates a heavy feeling in my brain and renders my progress with my mental health null. I am quite aware of the progress I made the past few months and I have even considered myself depression-free until I had an episode after feeling very stable for three weeks. I realized that depression isn't a one-time thing that can be cured with constant means of pharmacology.

I am now in this state of wanting to kill myself (again) but is too lazy to get a knife downstairs. I would know damn well that this feeling of emptiness and being suicidal will subside after this episode. Any tips to overcome this recursive state of mine? However, I might break out of this laziness phase and actually do it.",5
"Today has been harder than most. 

Bit backstory: my girlfriend and I recently broke up. It was something out of our control and I don't blame her or hate her for it, but it meant upending my life and moving 300 miles away and back in with my parents after 7 years of being in my relationship and being independent. I left my life and my cats behind, they were basically holding me together at the time. I lost my job in September and have had a really hard time finding work. So as you can imagine I'm feeling pretty low right now. 

The main issue: my mother and I have never really gotten along. She's unpleasant to be around for long periods of time. Fine in small doses though. She basically shits on everything I do or try to do. There's always something negative that she brings to the equation that takes the wind out of my sails. 

I went for a job interview last week, it went okay. Wasn't great, wasn't terrible. I was confident that I was on the border of getting it. I got the rejection email this afternoon. It felt like I got kicked in the stomach by a shire horse. It was an awful feeling being knocked back. I applied for 43 jobs and that was my only interview and I didn't get it. I was feeling pretty bad, then my mum came in to the room. She decided now was a good time to ask â€œwhat would you do if you didn't have me and your dad to feed you and keep you?â€ A pleasant topic of conversation. I said, â€œwell, I'd be homeless and sleeping rough I'd imagine mum.â€ She didn't seem satisfied by this response and decided to go on a tirade about how I should seek unemployment benefits and such. Which I would, but my last ounce of pride won't let me. I should also mention that I haven't asked for a penny of charity from her since I got back. Anything she and my dad have paid for is listed on my phone and I fully intend on paying her back when I'm working or have some money coming in. I haven't loaned money from my mum since I was at uni. Not because I didn't need the help, I just couldn't handle the arguing anymore. My sister however, currently owes my mum and dad thousands and they don't chase her for it. Whenever she needs help they drop what they are doing to help her. I don't know if I'm just bitter about that because my mum makes the statement â€œwe treat you both the sameâ€ all the time, but I know they don't. 

She continued to twist the knife until I couldn't take it anymore and just walked out of the room. 

I should say, that she doesn't seem to mind having me around when a delivery is coming and she wants to go and see a friend, or when I make lunch and dinner, or when I do housework. I feel like a should help out around the house where I can. Most of the time it's not good enough for her, but at least I tried. 

After all of this I'm just left with this feeling of uselessness and that I'll never be good enough. Maybe I'm being over sensitive with how much is going on (my ex and I broke up last month, so not that long ago). I don't know. All I know is I'm not sure how much of this I can take.",4

Got divorced, thrown out the flat, a whole lot of lawyer bullshit, and a lot more negative thoughts. Basically haven't been truly happy since then, and as things are turning into shit again, I am feeling that these suicidal thoughts are slowly finding their way back to me. I am on meds and seeking professional help, but I still feel very lost most of the time, feels like I am failing at every little thing I do, turning away from people I adore and not being fair to them, often feels like I am being torn apart form the inside and I am very surely getting sick of it. I've been depressed for as long as I can think of, not sure if I can hold it together for much longer.

Anyways the job is awesome, and I thought the homeless people would be hard to deal with, but no, it's no them, it's the coworker's that act like high school kids talking shit about the other coworkers. So I stay neutral when people say things about other people. We have this worker, and she's real mean to the people. It's like you'll ask yourself why is she doing this kind of work if she hates people? She i feed this lady who gets to the shelter late, and the coworker gets mad at me since it was late.. she calls me a pushover, then I tell her, ""I'm not a pushover I just have compassion. And that makes her mad! So, she says sorry at first. Then wants to have the last.word with me. So, she goes off on me, and I go.off on her. She lies and says I threaten her, and I get sent home.

I've been in a serious depressive episode for a couple months and I've always been able to say â€œat least I do good in schoolâ€. I need to do good so I can go to a good university after I graduate from this shitty community college and after studying my ass off I thought I actually did well on my midterms but I just barely scraped by. I can't get over how awful I feel and I know I'm overreacting. I know it's not the end of the world and I can improve my grades but I feel like a fucking idiot who can't do anything right and I know all of my professors are probably laughing at how terrible my tests were. All I want to do is cut myself and lay in bed during spring break because I don't deserve to do anything else. Why can't I just think rationally about this shit instead of blowing it out of proportion? It's probably my autism coming through. I told myself it would get better. It's not.

"Hey! The past year I've been really depressed. I tried to kill myself and felt like it wasn't getting better at all. I somehow managed to deal with everyday life, but I didn't really live. I knew what kind of behavior was appropriate and I tried acting accordingly, but I didn't feel what I was doing. The destination of my thoughts was always suicide. I thought about it a lot. I planned multiple suicide attempts. I wrote farewell letters. Stuff like that. 
Now I slowly return to my true self. It's like I'm able to see the world in colour again. It's not that I'm always happy. There are days I feel bad. Even days I'm depressed again. But it's way better than it used to be. I'm in touch with my feelings again. I've almost forgotten how sensitive I was. I feel alive again and that's fucking amazing!

"Hello!

First of all, I really appreciate that you are taking the time to read my post and whether you were able to provide me with advice or not, thank you!

I feel like in order to give a better understanding of my situation, I need to talk about what I've gone through (I'm sorry that it end being a very long post)

When I was a kid, I was pretty much normal and had my group of friends but I used to be very shy and faced a lot of verbal bias at that time but kept quite and thought it was a normal and ok thing, it didn't affect me though very much because of that. However in middle school, I've experienced trauma that changed me forever and left a very deep scar on me emotionally that took me years to overcome because no one tried to help, those who see me went through it and those who I spoke to about it didn't try to help. For years I had trust issues and was paranoid most of the time, it was my first experience of feeling alone and that no one understands me, and slowly I started to drift away and shut myself out, I just wanted to be alone and because of that I started to lose friends but I didn't care at that time, I thought I was doing the right thing by avoiding as much social interaction as possible. I guess in a way I was trying to protect myself.

The years after that, I've tried to regain my social life back and make friends again, I tried everything that I can from trying to act as a happy and funny person cause no one wants to see the real me, my depressing and sad self who wants to make friends with such a person? and when it actually works out, I thought I was doing the right thing but it ends up making me more depressed cause it takes me a lot of effort to be ""that person"" and I really didn't felt like I'm making any deep connection with anyone so I was like screw it, I'll just be myself by which I mean that I will not try anything to be forcefully liked by others and I thought since I'm into so many things, I will probably find someone who is into one of these things and be friends with but that didn't work out either. I kinda became that extra friend in a group that her existence or not didn't make any difference or that friend who you come to when your other friends are not around or that person you hang out not because you enjoy their company but you just don't want to be sitting alone. That messed me up in my senior year of high school, I felt like shit and I spent most of the time during the break in the toilet cause I rather that than feeling like shit when I am with others. And just to be clear, they are not awful people and they didn't say anything bad to me, it's just I've been friends with them for so long and whether at that time when I was trying to be the funny and happy person or myself, either way, I never felt I belong or that anyone cared, I felt I was just someone they knew and sure why not they can call a ""friend"".

In college though is where my struggle peaked, all those friendships that I made in high school are slowly disappearing everyone was moving on with their lives and I guess that means leaving unwanted relationships behind but regardless I did what I thought was right and did my part. I've reached out to them but it always ends up a one-sided relationship with everyone apparently and no one will reach out to me if I don't so I stopped. There was this one person I was close to during my school years and I tried to be the friend she can rely on in time of needs and depend on, I wanted to be always there for her but she never makes time for me but somehow she can with others so I tried to put ""our friendship"" to the test and just respond coldly to her messages just to see if she will ask what's wrong, I want her to notice that there was a problem and see if she gonna care about our friendship but she ends up unfollowing me in social media and blocked me out of her life that simply even though she perfectly knows me too well and knows that this is not my kind of behavior.

I had no problem talking with strangers, I can open a conversation and interact with anyone easily so trying to get to know people in college was not difficult except I don't think anyone wanted to be my friend, I just remain their classmate. I end up making just one friend in college, we had a lot in common and I really believed it could work out but it took a lot of ignoring of her frustrating attitude which sometimes makes me wonder if she will bother to hold on to me if I ever show my frustration. At some point, I've gone through a deep depression that made me very suicidal and thought there was no future for me but I was trying to hold on to hope and as much I want to act tough and act like I can handle this I couldn't, I really just need someone to talk to and so far as you can see I had no one except this college friend and I didn't know how it will go but thought let's give it a try so I opened up to her and after when I was done, the conversation didn't last for 2 minutes and I was so crushed because sure maybe she was not the perfect person to open up to but at that time I didn't have any option and I just really needed someone in my life to talk to. I really thought I'm gonna do it on that day cause I really lost hope.

As of now, it feels like I'm back at the starting point. I probably sound very awfully pathetic person or stupid to you. Every time when I'm not able to maintain any relationship in my life, I asked myself what's wrong with me? what have I done wrong in my life? I realized after a while that I try to fix things so hard in my life that I end up breaking it or damaging it but I always thought I was doing the right thing and doing my part by reaching out or helping out but somehow it doesn't make things better. It always seems that I'm the one making the effort and if you didn't notice, throughout those stages of my life that I mentioned no one tried to be my friend or wanted to but I've always seemed to be the one who wants to be someone's friend. Right now, I'm very much confused about what exactly I'm supposed to do. I just don't understand why I'm struggling so much to find somewhere I belong, I feel very much rejected no matter what I do. If I make an effort or not I end up alone either way. Everyone in my life seems to give up on me and no one bothers to hold on to me. I just don't know if I'm supposed to give up and just accept the fact that maybe this is how things supposed to be in my life.

I tried not to bore you guys with the details and complicate stuff, I hope my situation was made clear and it wasn't confusing. I just really need some advice cause I don't think I'm going to find a good one from my mind. One again, thank you for taking the time to read my post!",4

"I just don't. I feel so empty whenever I think about quitting playing videogames and smoking weed. I feel so, so burdened by having to learn things and develop skills. This is why I can't go back to school, because to be successful in school I'd have to start practicing a lot of new skills. I hate practicing skills. I hate practicing writing. I hate reading just for the sake of reading and self improvement. 

I don't care if I technically get better at stuff. It doesn't make me feel any better and it's actually a cause of suffering for me. Learning new things and going out of my way to practice skills is so un-enticing to me, that I legitimately believe my life has no hope and I'd rather be dead. There is no reward. No reward can give me back the time I lose to working diligently at something. And everything is so fucking boring. Knowing that I have to suck it up and literally CHOOSE to like things like hard work just make me want to go on a killing spree. It feels like a grave injustice. It's too late for me. I've played the videogames. I've smoked the weed. For years. I no longer reap ANY pleasure from hard work, from building connections, from sitting and reading, from studying; all this shit does is make me agitated and bored, but also hopeless, because there is no hope for me. There's no hope because I DO NOT WANT TO WORK. And I'm not talking about a fucking job. I'm talking about fucking EVERYTHING. I don't want to solve challenges in my life. No matter how hard I work anyways, nothing comes ANY fucking easier. Absolutely NOTHING. Not physically writing, not physically walking, not physically talking, none of it ever becomes second nature. I'm fucked. I just want to smoke and die.",3
"I dont talk to people about my issues, anxiety, depression, implosions, ect. Because I feel like everyone else has much worse problems and mine are trivial and stupid.

All my friends and family are so confused by my increasingly poor life decisions lately and I never have a good excuse. What am I supposed to tell them? That I'm so upset that it feels impossible to prioritize even the most important tasks. That I feel so lost that I don't give a fuck about the future consequences because of how much pain I'm in now? And why I don't bother telling anyone? Why I just keep it to myself and don't even want to use the word depression to describe myself? Because I honestly feel like a little entitled bitch trying to use mental health as an excuse for being lazy but I truthfully have not been content with anything in my life for the past 3 years and it feels like there's no escape from my mind. I've fantasized my suicide several times a day everyday for the last few months even though I have no plans of doing so. It gives me disturbing comfort. It makes me feel justified for making such a mess of my life. I once truly considered myself depressed. But now I don't consider myself depressed I don't think. There is no longer a root to my problems. I feel utterly broken.,5

"I'm 22. I've dealt with depression since Highschool, and I thought I got better for...I was doing great, went to college, got a job...But recently my anxiety has gotten really bad again...I dated this girl for a little over a year, then I felt myself slipping back into that depression (it was a long distance relationship, I'm in Cali, and she's back home across the country) anyway...I started getting bored I guess with the relationship because it was just like being in a relationship with facetime...We would try to meet up every now and then...But maybe saw each other about 3 to 4 times a year, and the distance just got in the way, and we decided mutually to sorta break it off. We would still FaceTime everyday, we'd pick a movie to watch together and it was just like we were dating still, but I couldn't tell her I love her anymore. And that's when my depression started coming back...Well, fast forward a few months, it's Christmas I'm home, and she spends my whole first day with me and my family. We wound up sleeping together that night, then the next day she has to leave because she has a job in a different state...We talked about what had happened, and she said it didn't mean anything. And I thought we were going to get back together again. But that never happened. Now, more recently...She started telling me about this other guy she's dating, and I try to be supportive she's moving on, so why can't I? All I can think about is them together, and him making her happier than me, like I wasn't good enough for her, but if she's happy with another guy then why do I want her to be unhappy with me? And I just keep having this one thought of them sleeping together. And that won't get out of my mind. It's all I think about every time she tells me they're hanging out. The thoughts don't stop, so I drink, and when I drink I cut, and I don't wanna cut anymore so I stopped drinking, and started scratching my fingers to the point it bleeds and scabs over, and it's only when I get panic attacks, but I get panic attacks every time I think about her, because when I think about her I think about him, and when I do that I see them â€œtogetherâ€ and what if he's better than? This is dumb I know because we broke up, but she'll still call me when she gets off work, or answer when I call her, but she just tells me about the guy, or she could just be talking about anything...But I just see them, and we hang up, and I want to cut, but I don't. I haven't cut in about two weeks now, and it's hard to get over her. Everyone has the one they let get away, and that was mine, and now I just regret not being there for her enough, I don't know what else I could've done though, I only get so much vacation days, and I'm sorta broke all the time...And I want to do something for her but I can't I just feel so alone and worthless all the time. I keep obsessing over the two of them together, and I just trigger my own panic attacks and I hate this. I wouldn't actually commit suicide, but the thoughts have started surfacing again...And I know it's not that I want to die, I just want not to feel this way, and I know it'll happen in time, but these past few weeks I've stopped eating, I've stopped sleeping, I just have trouble focusing on things I'm smoking waaay more than I normally do, and I just need help.

Sorry this is so long, I just don't really have anyone to talk to, and figured I'd just vent everything in front of strangers",4
"I've got a lot of work to do, but I can't do anything. The voice in my head says that even if I tried, I wouldn't get anywhere, I wouldn't succeed. That's why I always delay things, even though I have to do it at that time. The worst part is that I'm aware of this situation, and I'm still not doing anything about it. Time's going too fast and idk what to do. My anxiety gets worse at times like this and when it gets worse, I can't even sleep, let alone do anything.

I'm so tired of feeling this way, but like I said, I don't know what to do. I don't have anyone to talk to and I really need advice.

"It's just constant fucking stress. I literally would rather die than deal with this for one more day. I can't even afford my bills. I had to go on a subreddit and beg for money. Luckily someone helped me out. But that is not sustainable. I don't know what to do anymore. I moved across the country to â€œstart overâ€ and all I did was put myself way behind where I was in life. I had $5000 saved up to move and it's all gone. The job I lined up before I got here is complete shit. I only get eight hours a week. Eight fucking hours. That's down from twenty when I first started. And I've applied for every fucking job in this town with no calls back. I thought I was doing something wrong until I heard other people from work talking about having the same problem. It's a college town so every job is a competition with like 20,000 students. 

I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. I miss being able to go out and do things. Or even just handle my own problems as they come up. My snake had to go to the vet and I had to call and ask my grandparents to loan me money. Its so depressing. I just paid rent and now I have $20. That has to last until my next shift which is in like five days and in that time I have to buy cat litter and pay my electric bill. 

I'm fucking sick of life",2

"I'm 16 F diagnosed with depression. I'm thinking of killing myself tonight. Tried yesterday, failed. One of reason behind this is that I'm being burden on my family. I don't have mental capacity to think clearly. So I'm asking you. 

Dropped this year boards because I wasn't able to study at all. Its near beginning to next session, and I haven't recovered a bit. Because my parents this is happening because of some sort of supernatural evil thing. After diagnosis they didn't took me to therapy ever again. Rather they took me to get rid of that evil thing. I'm not gonna be able to to study and waste all their money again. They also have to give dowry for my marriage and pay for my education. And waste my life, and their money. We have financial problems too.

I think it's justified to commit suicide.

But what if ruin their mental health.

My mom had BPD, and schizophrenia. My sister is 10. I think this will ruin their life. But we aren't close emotionally. They might also be better without me.

My reality is mess, I think I can never recover, and waste my life, and live like this for 60 years, which is so scary. My mom doesn't go to a doctor because she thinks this is because of that evil thing. I'm scared for her. She doesn't eat because she thinks her enemy is gonna kill her if she does so. No matter how much we insist to take her to a doctor, she refused.

I'm stuck.

I'm scared of all the suffering there are in the world. I've seen street dogs die because of road accident, and there's no one to even take care of the dead body. His hide was there at the road. 

Please don't say not to commit suicide, just because of your moral obligation. Please answer if my family would be better without me. 

If you took your time to read all this, I can't thank you enough.",1
"i'm 17, im a senior in high school. i wake up, i go to school, i come home, i do my homework, i do chores around the house, i take care of the pets, i take care of myself, i eat when i should and i shower and i keep my room clean. i go to the gym and i actively produce art. i listen to music, i play guitar, i spend time with my mom and friends. im not unhappy, my life just feels so dull and gray. i'm not sad or angry, i'm not upset about anything. 

there have been previous years of my life that were overcome by anxiety and major depression and self harm and even a suicide attempt. but then i was sad, i was angry and confused and disgusted. i've suffered ptsd since age 12, and that affected me a lot. it still affects me, especially now that i have a form a physical ptsd (that's how my doctor described it, i don't know what else to call it) from overdosing 2 years when i tried to kill myself. 

but trauma aside, i don't feel anything negative. of course i have my bad moods like anyone else, but really i'd say i have more good moods than bad moods. i laugh, i smile, i joke (a lot, i'm the comedian of my circle). 

i tell you all of this because it's so odd that i live my life on autopilot, doing everything i should and being more positive than i used to be. but almost every hour of my day is filled with thoughts of suicide. i fantasize of slicing my wrists open to watch the blood pool in the tub beneath me. i imagine driving to the old hanging tree on the other side of town in the middle of the night and leaving my body dangling for someone to find in the morning. walking on the sidewalk i laugh to myself as i think about jumping in front of the cars rolling by. 

i don't self harm. i don't cry. it's all funny to me. it's all a game.",3

"I don't know if I'm overreacting about my feelings or not. I've contemplated about suicide several times. I don't want to live, but I'm too scared to actually try and kill myself. And then I feel like a piece of shit because I feel like I'm mocking the people who have actually attempted suicide, saying that I don't want to live when I'm too much of a pussy to try ending it myself. I don't know if I'm actually depressed, or going through that â€˜edgy teen phase'. I'm too scared to get it diagnosed, as I'm too afraid of what the results might say. 
I've told my dad around 2~3 months ago about how I felt, but I don't think he really cared. We basically had a small chat, and that was all. I think he thought I was overreacting about he whole thing. And so, even I don't know if what I feel is as serious as I think it is.",4

"Basically I've always been a little listless and sad, even in elementary school. I got ok grades, didn't really excel at sports. I started getting really great grades in college and joined a magazine, volunteered for the local Democrats, had a barista job etc. But still, even when I was seen as â€œokâ€ I was miserable. But, I have a lot of friends, I am kind and funny and have a nice time speaking to people. 

Now I'm three years out of post grad and I'm really suffering. I have been a poor performer at every job I've done post grad from the internship, agency, to the tech job I have right now. I have been put on a 30 day performance review and probably getting fired.

I don't know what I want to do. I don't know why I make these mistakes and fuck up my entire life. I feel like I'm broken, how will I ever make money?? I'm really on my own. I have rent and bills to pay. I could get another job, but I can't deal with sucking and getting fired at the next one. 

I am on Prozac now so I am hoping this will help. I feel like being up for being fired was a wake up call. I am so ashamed I let this happen.

Everyone else says I'll get back on my feet but I'm really not ok and I have no idea what to do.

"I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression right now and I have been taking prescription meds for the last couple weeks. It really helps! 

A little background- I got out of a 6 year relationship due to not seeing a future with my ex in December 2019. And then one person who I thought was really close friend of mine, decided he did not want to be friends with me anymore and cut all contacts with me. I get emotionally attached wayyy too easily and this led to me having anxiety, panic attacks and depression - which eventually led to insomnia, IBS, migraines and constant body aches. 

I started therapy in feb 2020 and have been since going to my therapist every week. And my therapist suggested I look at options for medication and try it. So since the last 2 weeks, I'm on Lexapro (SSRI) and my psychiatrist did tell me that it is going to take a few weeks to see changes. But for the last 3/4 days I have been observing that my energy levels have increased because I have been able to sleep well and it is so much better. My IBS has decreased and I haven't got any migraines. I'm really really glad the medication is helping. If anyone is out there looking of options, and one the fence of trying medication, go for it. I'm sure if it working and it will help.",4

I think that going back to uni (in a course that requires I have bare arms for practicals/placements) and having people see my recent self harm scarring is going to be the final straw that pushes me over the edge.

I've spoke to my doctor and they asked if I'm suicidal and I told them I was, they then asked if i made any ""concrete plans"" which I responded no. They then basically said coke back in a week and see how you feel. It's like no one even cares if I had concrete plans to kill myself I wouldn't be going to the doctors would I? My depression has consumed me and I feel like there isnt enough of me left to fight back. People say that it does get better but in all honesty there is no guarantee that it will and I'm not sure if I want to spend the next 60 years of my life fighting a battle I cant win.

I can't deal with her moods anymore
I can't deal with her bias anymore
I can't deal with being used as her verbal and emotional punching bag

I can't keep coming home and wondering what sort of mood she's in.
I can't dread her waking up in the morning, knowing she's in a shit mood 13 out of 14 days
I can't walk in or out of the house, say hi/bye, give her a kiss to be told to fuck off, I hate you, you're a piece of shit, a cunt, or that she wishes I get hit by a train, have a car accident or similar.
I can't be told I don't do anything around the house, or about all the things I â€˜don't do'.
I can't be told that I'm a shit father, and about all the things I don't do with them, even though I'm with them every night and weekend when she's at work, I take them to school, make their lunches and dinner.
I can't be told how crap my family is, and that my dad who dies 3 years ago was a lazy piece of shit.
I can't fight with her every time my mum is in town and wants to see us and the kids, especially as she's moving to the same town this week so she can see more of us.

I can't hear her complain about the kids and how much they fight - where do you think they learnt that behaviour from?
I can't hear about finances, when we spend SO much on takeaway food or fresh food that gets thrown out because it's gone off uneaten.
I can't hear her complain about her weight, you got the op done, lost heaps of weight and haven't been to the gym to tone.
I can't hear her complain about not going to the gym and having paid for the membership for the last 8 months, you're in control of your days and how you spend it.

I can't be told that I'm just here to look after the kids and support you and them financially.

"I am in a very dark place right now. I'm 32. I've been unemployed since last October after getting laid off (not due to performance, my whole team and 15% of my company got let go) and do not have a firm idea of what to do with my life. I have started to interview again over the past few weeks but they are mostly for the same type of work (which is pretty niche, not a ton of jobs available) and I just don't know if this is what I want to be doing for the rest of my life. In the meantime, I have been getting dicked around by recruiters and just feel like I'm getting left out to pasture even though I feel like I have a good background and interview well. 


Simultaneously, I am finishing up a part-time MBA program which I feel like has been a colossal waste of time, money, and energy. I honestly feel like I had better luck getting responses to job applications BEFORE starting my program. I have been slogging through my final semester, struggling to find the motivation to do my work. I finish in about 2 months, at which time I may or may not be employed again. I just don't know. It's extremely stressful. I will need to begin paying my college loans within 6 months of graduating and don't know how I am ever going to save for a down payment. I immensely regret going to business school. 


Add to this the fact that, for whatever reason, I seem to be getting ignored by just about every therapist I've reached out to for counseling. Maybe I need to start leaving messages that I'm thinking about ending it. I feel like I am losing my mind, and the only thing that keeps me feeling sane is my girlfriend, who without I'm not sure what I'd do. Unfortunately, she doesn't know about my compulsive masturbation/porn addiction which seems to be consuming my life at the moment. I'm a \*\*\*\*ing mess and I don't know what to do. 


It's hard for me to think about actually killing myself, but I find myself thinking about it often.

"The last couple of months , I've been tired . 

I wanna die. Really badly. I don't wan't to cause the people that somehow still love me this pain, they need me here. But I am just so tired, so fucking tired. I'm tired of this sad, mean, world. I feel like I can succeed, but I don't see the point if I still will not be happy. On the other hand I get the point, try to make family happy, and spend the little time we have with the ones we love. Someone of you may say, ""at least you are lucky you have people that love you this much"", and that is true. If it wasn't for them, I would not be here a long time ago. However, perhaps the feeling that brings within me the most pain and sorrow is: what if that love is not reciprocated? Don't get me wrong, I love these people. But I don't love spending time with anyone. I don't even love spending time by myself. I don't know what I want or what will make my day better. The thought of going through the same cycles of just trying to find some little piece of happy in the day for me and my loved ones for the rest of my life makes me not want to live through it. I find the bad in every activity, see the negative flaw of every person, while at the same time try to keep 'face' as much as possible. I think I can summarize this feeling into: I feel guilty for the pain that I cause my loved ones, but at the same time I am so fucking selfish. I just can't take it anymore. I feel like I am loosing my shit, I don't even know if I am depressed, crazy, bipolar, i don;t know. It just hurts. I want it to stop. \*I wanted better for myself

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I don't know why I am writing this. 

I don't even want any help or input{

I just want this sadness to go way, I can't go around another day with my head down and my eyes filled with tears. I just feel like I wasn't born to act like this, I wanted to be strong physically and mentally in order to provide for my loved ones, not tear them down with my negativity. 

everyone problem is bigger than mine. I am just a selfish bitch who is too much of a pussy to deal with his own fucking emotions. There are people in this world who have gotten a much shittier hand. yet here i am fucking wanting to die. how does this make any sense?

It's also really hard to hide being so fucking sad; I am 6'6, live with my loving girlfriend, and trying to be social in years when I still had hope means there are still people who think I want friends in my life that try to reach out once in a while. Only to receive an excuse/ insult/ rambling when I try to avoid them.

No matter how much effort I put into happiness, I can't seem to get close without cheating. Sure, some things make me happy, but as soon as they do, my mind almost tries to find the negative in the situation.

To end this shit, I wanna make a wish. 
I wish for the kids who have to be strong, to have bull sized balls, and help every person in need. 

Because the false sense of protection is the last thing that they need. 

If you can't do it, don't say you can. Because when you don't, or aren't here, they will stay behind wondering why you every left.

"It's 4 am for me. Stuck alone in my room with my thoughts and I don't know why I'm even posting about any of this but I just have no one to turn too.

A little background information about me to help paint a picture. I'm 21 and gay and I am depressed, alone, filled with anxiety, and extremely suicidal. There really hasn't been a day that has gone by where I don't think about killing myself, negative thoughts about myself, just bursting into tears alone in my room or just in public.

The pain that I am feeling is completely unbearable, I'm just so tired of even living and moving forward in this life when I just don't think worth it. My whole life I just have been faced with pain and pain and pain again and I just keep trying and I'm just so tired. I'm tired of this life. Tired of the pain and just tired with myself.

I have come to the realization that no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, or how hard I try to become someone else. I just will never be good enough, that has always been what my life has been about. I don't even know who I am anymore, I look in the mirror and I just don't recognize who I am anymore let alone know who I am anymore. Sounds weird, I know. It's just I was never happy with who I was as a person and that always fucked me up then I try being other people and that always fucked me up so I just never win. It's just so fucking disheartening and gruesome to just always be put back in this hellish place of just never being enough, uglyness, trying so hard and getting fucked and this whole stupid ass existence.

I just don't see a future anymore. I don't want to see tomorrow anymore. I'm constantly wishing for death. Hoping I get run over by a car, get in an accident, OD on anything. Just something that will take this pain away.

I have been feeling this way for years and years and I just never seem to get a break, not even for a single moment. I am always brought back here. This is all I never know. I don't deserve love or happiness or even a glimpse of joy. I'm always there for others and I try my best to be supportive to show my love and care but when it come's to me I just don't get it.

I'm ready to go. I say that every day and yet I'm still here.... I don't know why that is though. But at the same time I just feel like i'm one step closer to pushing the trigger and ending it all. Sorry for my foolishness. I probably will delete. But hey if I ever end up doing it, my thoughts will be here.

I almost feel like just ending it all now before my life takes another turn for the worse because it 100% will. I just wanna die and be at peace for once in my life. Maybe take one shitty person out of this world, that can be my 1 good deed I think.",5
"I feel horrible. I'm too scared to open up to anyone because I'm worried they'll just go tell the office and boom, I have to run another lap through the system that has done virtually nothing for me the first two times. Same deal with my parents. You can't open up about suicide without consequences, and I'm sick of the ones. I feel guilty because I know I'd worry everyone because of course they don't want me to die, if they care about me or not they don't want somebody to kill themselves regardless. I feel so bad for feeing like this regardless of what anyone does to try and help me, even if it's gotten better since the last time I went through the system, suicide still feels most optimal even though I really don't want to die.",4
"I really do not understand why I am isolated for ""coming across"" a certain way. People will judge you based off your innate defense mechanisms, but then the next day, it's like when I hit reset and try again to get to know someone, I can't. I'm a permanent smear of my mistakes. (I'm human, others aren't I guess?) I guess depression has made me ""unapproachable"". Which I don't grasp, because I am constantly in the presence of people who treat me like dirt (which obviously puts me in the offensive).

A lot of people around me also get defended by their friends when they face trials, I.E. ""they're having a hard time, just try to understand them"". But I get told to change. As if I don't deal with my own? It makes no sense.

Does anyone else do this? Face isolation because people misunderstand their emotional turmoil? This has caused me great hardship, stress, and mental breakdown. It'd be nice to feel normal.

"I don't have a heart, I never ever get that feeling when you like/care about someone. I don't care about my family, friends, acquaintances, people, no one. What joy is there to live if you cant feel?",4
"My heart hurts from the pain, I wish I could just disappear, my parents have gone through so much because of me, they do so much to make me happy ,Even my siblings are jealous, I feel so guilty they have to deal with me, see their child try to kill themselves everyday, crying from depression. I just want them to know I love them so much, I can't even describe how much I love them, and I'm so sorry for what I'm doing, what I am feeling, what I am going to do in the future, I would love to change but I can't.

I just wish there is something I can do to feel happy again.",4
I wish i had the guts to kill myself,0
It hurts..but I remembered the feelings I had last time I went and saw you. It hurt..I cried myself to sleep. I went to bed hurting and I woke up hurting. Once again I'm left looking dumb to go out of my way to see you. I crossed many busy roads and climbed many tall mountains to just try and please you and I still believe you truly don't care. It's hard letting go of the one person that once made you the happiest you had ever been in life. Looking back at when I had you I looked so different. I literally had a glow within me. You gave me that glow that made me shine so bright..you also took it away without any hesitation. I've never been the same since then. I'm not sure why I've kept you around for 2 more years after we broke up. I know deep down you will never be able to make me shine like you used to..I will never have that glow again. I will never be able to feel that love again..and it simple as to why not..because you don't love me..you don't care about me..It's funny how life works. How the people you would do anything for in this world will do nothing for you. How the ones that once made you so happy now bring darkness into your life. When will one day someone fight for me..fight to keep me seeing me glow...fight to keep me happy..Hopefully soon..but for now as I wait I've decided to not cross any busy roads for you or climb any mountains..for now I will stay here even though it hurts I'm safer here by myself than with you.,4

"I had an open cosmetic rhinoplasty 4 months ago and since then I've been experiencing symptoms that have been fairly debilitating for me. A few weeks post-op I noticed that my air flow was different in each nostril and there was a slight pain in my left but I chalked it up to swelling. 

Now, 4 months later there is no more pain but I feel like there is a blockage in my left nostril and I can't sense airflow at all in either nostril which is keeping me up at night. 

I'm on sleeping pills which is barely helping me get a few hours throughout the night. I'm really scared and did not expect to go through this scary journey - all I wanted was a refinement. How would I know if I have empty nose syndrome or if I should wait longer to see if my issues are resolved naturally? 

Please help anyone who has gone through something similar or knows someone who has gotten better as I've become a shell of myself.. going from perfect breathing to feeling like I'm walking around with a bag over my head all day is devastating and the real kicker is I'm not even happy with the cosmetic result but at this point I just want to breathe again,,,",3
"have been feeling incredibly self conscious, depressed and terrible about my own self and my self as a sexual being. I constantly compare myself sexually with other partners my s/o has had Bc she will talk about them (not trying to hurt me) but I am so extremely self conscious that I can't even masturbate. It's enough to ruin my day sometimes and even bleed into other parts of my life and relationships. I feel so terribly low that I don't feel the love from my s/o even though she tries her hardest. I love her and want to propose but I can't do that right now Bc of how im feeling. I want to feel loved and not so bad about myself. I can't seem to find a direction in life either and don't know or have any idea of what my future will look like. I'm at a point of giving up and I don't know what to do to even help myself.

"I have never understood the distinction between therapy like CBT which tries to train you to think more positively to reduce or eliminate depression, which is sort of the underlying belief of most psychology thinking, versus the sentiment that one cannot think themselves out of depression.

"This is kinda a vent; I need to look myself in the mirror for a few minutes and try to restart my downward cycle. If you want to have a conversation, I'm here for it, otherwise nothing to see here haha.

I've been so low the past couple weeks I haven't felt like myself at all. I've felt a fair amount of that apathy I read about on this sub often, and it's scary.

I know the things I need to do in order to overcome this depression - the tools I can reach for. Exercise, nutrition, therapy, group therapy, being open with friends and family, volunteering, strong social connections, medical health, and on and on. The laundry list is long and tough to grapple with all at once. But having a couple of weeks of pure hell makes me realize that I'm really not working on any one of those things strongly. 

What have I done to really move forward in the last year? I feel like I haven't really reached for any of those huge steps since I started therapy in 2015. I've been going for over four years, and it's been life-changing, but what other healthy steps have I taken? 

Last summer my dental health became overwhelming, something I must take care of. I went back for my first appointment in years. Gradually I took care of my pain and the rot in my mouth was alleviated. I lost a tooth in the process but a huge weight was lifted as well. 

I need some similar weight lifted now, but most of all I want to be able to reach for it. I crave some discipline; the dental work came as a result of time running out as it were, reactive not proactive. I want to be strong enough to work thru this shit at a healthy pace, not leave things go awry for months on end, until a consequence happens. But I suppose in order to get there I have to first admit that I AM weak and I DO need help. I can't do it all on my own like I tell myself I must. 

I'd really like to get an exercise bike. I can see all the positives: cardio health/body positivity/motivation to hike more/overall getting in shape. For someone healthy, buying a bike (putting in the research, going to stores, asking people for advice) would be doable. Simple tasks like that are fucking hard for me because I'm not healthy.

So how do I get there? Ask my sister to take me shopping one day? This post is a good start: question why I've failed in the past and talk through the doable steps, remind myself of the positive outcomes in working thru it. Maybe I need to meditate again: breathe thru the pressure in my chest when I think about going to a bike store or talking to people on Craigslist. 

I wish I could work thru these things easily like a normal person. I guess my win today is admitting I'm broken and depression is at fault. Maybe if I admit that more often I'll see it's ok to ask for help and beat myself up less.

I've never really lost love for myself because I know I'm a good man. My therapist told me that purpose can be looked at as two halves: BEing and DOing. Right now I'm happy with my self-philosophy and who I am when I'm NOT depressed. That person is good. It's time to accept that I'm not healthy enough to DO good yet. At least not to the degree that I hope my future holds. It's hard to reconcile how much depression is holding me back. I hope I can look myself in the mirror this deeply in the next little while and reach for more of that help that I need to pick myself up off the ground. Maybe it can start with the exercise bike.",1
"I have been through a very hard life, from my single parent mother being addicted to drugs, being in Foster care for 7 years, to being homeless for 6 years. I have and had finally gotten myself where I needed to be. I got a puppy I love dearly and has been my Emotional Support animal. I do everything in life for him now. I finally got my own place after 4 years. I have a great job that I am happy to go to and I can afford to pay my bills and all of my habits/ needs. Today I got a notice to vacat after spending months fighting over Landlord Obligations. I lost my old job a month ago because of the emotional distress that I was in. I literally told my manager ""How can i care about someones remote not working and sit with all sincerity to trouble shoot, and I go home everyday to no heat and my dog shaking uncontrollable, but keeps a smile on his face for me?"" I was unable to pay my electric bill, so they are trying to evict me on the premise of breaking the lease. All of this is breaking my faith. I am trying so hard, but everytime I get a head there's something trying to break me. Today I have fallen back into my depression and cant help but say it's better to give my pup away to someone more stable and kill myself. I cant keep going and dealing with uncertainty or being homeless. I try so hard everyday, to just get pushed back into the void. It took me losing myself and being at the end and seeing the darkness as a comfort, for me to get to where I am now. Yet, it seems life wants me to go back there. I am numb and ready.",2
"I have been a chronic sufferer of gad all my life. Thanks to klonopin my worries symptons anxieties were gone. But now, the side effects of overdosing on it (which I dont understand cause I only take 2 a day maybe its because my inept doctor upped the dose from 0.5mg to 1) has made my emotions go haywire.

I'm constantly euphoric, spontaneous feeling of deep rage and an impulse to punch and scream. On top of that, being ticked off by little things and become explosive. 

If the price to pay to not feel worried all the time is explosive behaviour Id rather take the other. I have recurred to smoking to calm myself. Right now Im a step away of losing control over and really lose myself go in a blind beastly rage.

"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting in this thread so bare with me. 

So I've been suffering from depression on and off for years, I'm currently in an off cycle but feel kind of down/low energy but not enough for me to call it depressed. Anyway, I somehow completely forgot about music and haven't listened to it for months. I commute on the bus, and I usually just sit and browse reddit, and when my bf drives me the radio is usually off because I get sensory overload if he tries to talk while the radio is on, so we usually just keep it off. 

Anyway, yesterday when I went in the car the Bluetooth function was on as I guess my bf was listening to his music on his way home from work, and it automatically connected to my phone and started playing my music. It was a song by the Jonas brothers (embarrassing) from like 2008, and it just made me so so happy and I started vibing so hard before I had to start work. I seriously forgot about music. I told him now that every time he drives me to work I should play my music to give me a quick happy boost before work. Has anyone else just forgot about something that would give them joy?",0

i will never be me, not truly, nature saw to that, its a cruel thing what i am, to feel and associate with something im not even close to being, the pain of not being it, if i ever had a choise i would never feel this pain from it, but it never was my choise this pain of not being the woman i feel i am inside that burden came to me, i no longer know how or what i am, all i know is that im defective, thats how i see myself at least.

i`ll be sad to see it all gone, and i wish i had the strength to stay, but i no longer do, thats the complete truth


i was never cut out for living, takes to much effort for me to even live, my parents had at least one child that wasent a complete fuck up, at least my older brother didnt fail.

goodbye everyone, thank you to everyone that tried to convince me to stay in my previous posts, and im sorry to those how i let down on this day, know that i appreciate your effort even if it was wasted on me

"I'm having doubts about wanting to keep going. I just turned 25, I'm a girl from the US who is disabled (I have depression, BPD, anxiety, ADD and I have bad tremors as a result of these issues) and my parents treat me like I'm a little girl. I have not worked a proper job very much in my life and I'm a little immature for my age. 

Basically, where I am now, I feel mentally and physically unwell to work - the tremors go in and out and I collapse of exhaustion at least twice a month from them. My parents, my mum especially- are pressuring me to work, she gives me jobs I know I wouldn't be able to handle and I apply to them to make her happy, though I never hear back. She is a social worker and when I say I'm too unwell to work she goes *â€I've worked with people with Down's syndrome, who were severely disabled, they had jobs.â€* or *â€I worked with a schizophrenic woman once, that's worse than what you have, and she held down a 9 to 5 job.â€* and so fourth. I think I should be on disability but my mum sees that as â€œgiving upâ€ and says that they won't accept me because I â€œhaven't showed signs of tryingâ€ IE my small work history - the majority of money I've made over the years is from my music, but that comes few and far between.
Because I don't have a job, my mum makes it my â€œjobâ€ in the house to be the only person who ever cleans our cats' litter box, and when my tremors are going this is bad because I can't hold the bag straight and I get litter and cat droppings everywhere, but she's so insistent on sticking it to me that I'm not working that this doesn't matter. 
I Have two girlfriends, my parents only know I'm dating one of them. One lives in Canada, I have wanted to run away there but my mum said if I even tried to visit her she would get Canadian police to come get me since I'm mentally unwell (my Canadian girlfriend also struggles with that and my parents like her but says she's a â€œbasket caseâ€ and that I shouldn't date her) but I kinda don't have a passport anyway.

My other girlfriend lives in the Midwest US and my mum says if I moved there I'd never contact the family ever again even though I told her I would, and that I would become ungrateful towards my girlfriend and get an â€œattitudeâ€ with her - my parents say I have a short temper but I'm quite mellow, it's just that years of verbal bias from my father - who to his credit is finally doing something about this - has gotten me very damaged.


Anyways, I like tried to stab myself in the stomach but was stopped and the knife was taken from me. I feel stuck, and I really want to keep going but it's getting really difficult. I don't want to break my girlfriends' hearts. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I'm just unstable or if my parents are really mistreating me.",3

"I have a low IQ. Twice I've been tested and both times I got an IQ around 84-85. Somehow, I didn't do entirely awful in school, I was able to be a B student without much studying. When I actually started studying I started to get grades in the 90s and even some at 100%. Even though I skimmed through with exemplary grades, I barely retained any of what I learned. Nobody around me believes that I am stupid because of my grades, but that is all they go off of. I have a poor vocabulary overall, especially in spoken word, and I cannot do basic mental math. I still count with my fingers and I am nineteen years old. I am from a low income, uneducated family so I was innately disadvantaged from birth, also with having my mom smoke weed and cigarettes throughout her pregnancy with me. During the 8th month of her pregnancy I detached from the placenta and they had to preform an emergency c-section. It is very likely that I have brain damage from oxygen deprivation. 

I just feel incredibly empty every moment I am awake. My favorite time of the day is when I go to sleep at night, but night always goes by too quickly. Lately I've been spending everyday sleeping because I have much more joy in my dreams. I just want at least an average intelligence, at least. It is unbearable being aware every moment that I am dumb and will only ever be dumb. I have always aspired to leave the financial hole, but everyday that passes reminds me that it will probably never happen. At this point I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place, because I am terrified to leave behind my family and my pets, but I know if I continue living my life will only get worse and worse.

"A few years ago I had a solid group of friends I would hang out with pretty much every weekend. I felt like we could tell each other anything, like out souls were connected. But little by little, they began to drift away. Their social media now filled with photos of people I didn't know with captions all about their 'bestie' or 'sister' or 'wifey'. That used to be me. I ask everyone to hang out, even try reconnecting with old friends, every time I either get ghosted or a simple 'omg I miss u too! I'm just so busy rn but we should totally hang!' with no follow up. I'm alone. Every weekend i sit at home with my cat and watch Netflix. I can feel the stress building up on my shoulders with no relief in sight. I just want to have that experience of being around someone who wants to be around me too. I would kill to have a friend again",0
"I've never posted before but I feel at a loss and can't seem to find anything online similar so figured I'd post. 
Bit of backstory my boyfriend (5 years) had called me while I was at work on Monday saying that he was checking himself into a mental health hospital. I knew roughly why he would be there but it was still such a shock to me. It wasnt until a few days later that he opened up to me and said that he had made a plan and chose out the weapon but decided after his therapy session that he didnt want to do it anymore. So it's a weird in between spot. While he didnt necessarily attempt suicide he was damn close. Closer than I ever could have imagined.
I had just started a new job with a bakery about a month ago and then this happened. I've had a hard time coping with everything and so I told my boss I probably wouldn't be back until the following Monday. Fast forward to Friday I get a call from one of my friends who helped get me the job and she's saying that my work team is trying to be understanding but that they think and my friend thinks I'm being immature and irresponsible for not going to work. My friend even went far enough to say that maybe I wasn't strong enough for my boyfriend since I couldn't find it in myself to go to work through this. 
I guess I'm asking for advice. My friend said my work is talking about cutting my hours since now I've shown I'm not reliable even though before this happened I had never so much as shown up late before or called out. What would you do? I feel at a loss because yes I realize I should be working but I don't know how to face my work after this especially knowing they are annoyed with me.",4
"You always hear how women fear they won't love their child if it's adopted which in most cases isn't true. But in our case it seems to be true. Thank you for all the nice Christmas gifts you gave me. But you never gave the sense you cared about me. You were never there for me. I'm always getting blamed for things and It always feels like you just shrug me off. I never felt comfortable coming to you for advice and you never asked. Why is the connection between us nonexistent? You taught me about my period, you gave me a book that explained puberty. You never taught me about sex. You never ask if I have a boyfriend. You never ask me anything. You don't really know me at all. I try to talk to you and you seem annoyed when I do. I come to you for guidance about what I should major in and you just judge me for not being able to make up my mind. You're always petty when I give you attitude but you don't ask why.

You never helped me with school and hated that I wanted my license and I'm trying to get my citizenship and you couldn't care less that I'm not one.

"I've seen people question this before, but never identified with it enough to pay attention until now. So, here is the post.

I will frame unnecessary explanations with ""//"", in case anyone reading wants to skip. Although I'd like to warn you that this post is somewhat long regardless, as I like to explain things.

I've been considering myself unworthy (of a real friend, of feeling better, of complaining) since a long time, as I have a nice life, or because that I'm not feeling as bad as many other people who are said to be depressed. I obviously never wanted to be sad, nor to experience bad things, but I wanted to be worthy of some certain things I felt I needed. Over time I began feeling worse and worse, to a point where I compare myself more than I used to do, where almost everything upsets me. 

//For example, let's say there is a character I relate to and am happy about being alike. That used to be a source of motivation. Now when I see this character, I can only think of how much better this said persona is compared to myself, and how I can never be like them. When I look at something I value, rather than being happy I feel worried of what might happen to them. Or, when entering a new season I mourn the previous, alongside all the time I wasted.//

I'm mostly worried, stressed, or sad. The thing is that there is no clear reason for me to feel so. I sometimes question if I myself feel that way..



I also am having a hard time figuring my feelings for over a year. There are some occasions where I thought I didn't feel anything, but couldn't help crying.

The reason I'm writing this post is that, while watching a show, a character explained a 'negative' habit of the other, which I ultimately related to. It's not something I consider to be really bad. However, after that scene I couldn't somehow focus to the episode. My interest faded to a point. It was almost as if I was reacting to what was said, but I don't even care that much. The character cared, but not me. Was I impersonating his emotions? Or am I just faking all these to feel worthy? I cannot understand this. Am I really sad or am I just kidding myself?

I can barely read my own feelings, beliefs, and thoughts at this point. Like, I still know what they are, but I can't feel that. Not always, but mostly it's like a colourless, pitcureless page of information. ""I feel this, I think that."" but, do I really? Am I even myself, or am I just pretending?",5
"I want to talk to someone who understands this feeling. I'm tired of hearing ''it's going to be okay''. I even tire myself saying it. I just want someone to hug me ad cry about this shitty life with me.... but I can't... I'm alone in this... at least physically. 

There's a reason why this subreddit has thousands of members. At least I'm not ''completely'' alone.",5
I'm sad. I hate myself. Hi,1
"So I've suffered some heavy depression for a long time, my ex that I absolutely loved to the max just got along so well, she was so gorgeous, caring, loving and nice. She was the first girl I actually loved in a long long time. Me and her were so good for each other I thought. She knew I was suffering from depression but the crazy part is every day I was with her I was improving. She was the support I used to slowly walk up the steps to getting better. I was happy as can be to have a girl like that and for myself to climb out of that depressed hole I was in for so long. Well we got into an argument before our breakup because I thought we were being pretty distant and she blew up. She told me â€œI just can't handle it anymoreâ€ and left me, I was heartbroken. She couldn't handle my depression anymore and that's what hurt the most. I loved her with my whole heart and now she looks at me like I'm some stranger on the streets. She never truly explained to me why everything happened and she won't talk to me at all now. I thought I was making us stronger by opening up to her and having her help me but she never told me how much I was hurting her with my depression. She saw me improve so much and deciding to leave outta no where made no sense to me. Well here we are today, all that progress lost. I feel worse than I ever have in my life. It really fucking hurts to know the one person I loved most couldn't handle me at my worst and left me to rot. I don't even know what to do. I've deadass just been hooking up with girls at parties and drinking with my friends until I blackout. I don't know if I can trust another girl with any of my emotions again or even trust myself to love someone again. I just wanted to give her the world but I ruined it for her and us. I'm a piece of shit I know, but i just want her to see that I was improving and for her to come back.",4
"Yesterdays brawl is enough for me. Just another reason to do it, and to be honest main reason of all the bad things happening, it's better to be abandoned, rather than have a ""family"" like that, if you can even call 1 parent that hates you, and blames for everything, a ""family"". 

I must admit, it felt good to say what I said, and do what I did. It feels so good to know it's soon to be over, I fear death, and pain, but the peace that comes afterwards is what I have been waiting all my life, honest smile. 

It's moments like that, that we are waiting for, a spark that lights the shit up, and helps it explode.

Desireless - Voyage Voyage, I love this song. Time to prepare! I wasn't expecting to be that long here, but the time has come, I remember every single time I did something.

"I've been feeling the exact same way for years. I get momentary feelings of happiness and then they just disappear. I have little to no energy anymore and I'm not excited to talk to anyone. I don't think any of my friends care about me and I can't depend on my family for any support. I'm on a waiting list for a mental health service but it's going to take a while but I don't know how long I can keep feeling like this.

I got my first job the other day and although I've met some nice people, I still feel like shit. My parents think I'm instantly cured because of the fact I'm now working but in truth I'm thinking about just ending it all. Nothing is going to change or help.

How I flip flop about whether I'm ok where I am I'm this job, I think not but some days I get by just about ok &amp; maybe it's not so bad.

"I have been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety years ago. Hi, I'm a 41 year old male with a good job, make good money, why should I be hurting? Depression, anxiety and suicide runs in my family. I have been committed to a 72 hour hold twice for being suicidal and planning my suicide. I do self harm. I think about suicide weekly, sometimes daily. I don't want medication but I self medicate with alcohol, work obsession or high risk sports. I'm embarrassed because I can't fit in with life, I'm broken with no fix. I suffer in silence as I don't want to bother my family, friends and girlfriend. I have planned my suicide many times, even tonight. Yes, I have written many suicide notes as well.

If I tell someone, they lock me up without shoelaces. This is not what I need, this causes me to hide it even more. I'm broken with no fix. I already go through cycles of being numb, angry, and sad. I don't want to feel numb from medication (I've been there before, what is the purpose.). I don't trust anyone to talk about this with, they respond with ways that make me hide my what I truly feel.

I want this pain to stop, the pain I've been feeling for years. Why am I broken? Besides not waking up, I don't know what else is the answer. I understand why my family member committed suicide, I get it, it isn't selfish, it is to stop the pain that many can't understand.

I don't know what to do. Do I end it, hide in silence and keep everyone happy, or say something and be even more miserable and in turn become more numb? Who really cares? I know alcohol doesn't help, but it helps me sleep, or if I don't drink here I am wide awake trying to make my brain quiet. I do high risk sports, secretly hoping that I will die.

I spent last night at the emergency room alone, I didn't contact my family, friends and erased a message for my girlfriend (I wasn't sure if it was a heart attack and didn't want to die alone but didn't want to bother anyone). My girlfriend saw some erased messages, so I told my girlfriend that it was some chest pain I wanted to make sure wasn't anything, I never told my family or friends and never will.

I don't know what to do, I need this to stop. This is my cycle, I'm numb or angry at everyone and push everyone way. If I wake up tomorrow, I will think whoever wrote this is an idiot and stupid, numb and ignorant to the pain I feel. Cycle repeats.

"I just feel like something put there is telling me to kill myself. It just keeps throwing shit out me till I give up. I think I can finally take a breather. And then theres something else to stress about. This time, I was about to be late on rent. But I did all I could to get the money together. (I'm not even gonna say all the things I did to get the money) but then. I just got off work. And I was about to swing by the bank to withdraw the money to lay rent. But then my car wouldn't start. And I'm completely alone in this state. So I had to call someone to come out and jump me. But it wouldn't jump. So I had to spend money to get it towed. Then the damn mechanic shop jerked me around, and ended up fighting with them alot ( I use to be a mechanic so I know when I'm getting jerked around) but they were so incompetent, that it took them 6 hours to basically figure out that the battery needed to be replaced and then do it. They lied to me when they told me the tested the battery when they first pulled it in the bay. They put a new starter on, without telling me until after the fact. And then told me my engine was seized up due to there being 0 oil in it. Which I dont know if I believe, because I just got my oil changed about a week and a half ago. And I know I dont have a leak. So either they were lying or the technician at the luge shop didnt put oil back in my car. But anyway, long story short. They forced me to pay 600$ for basically a battery change. And then I had to go back to work 2 hours later, with no sleep since my last shift. So that was great. But that 600$ was going to be for my rent. No I dont have any money. And I'm not sure what I'm going to do. I think I've finally reached my breaking point.",2
"I met this girl month ago and i feel in love very quick. She is from Portugal and i am from Slovenia.. And we thought about having a long distance but she feels like its not gonna work. We talked about it 2 days ago and i told her i cant be there just friends because im only making myself suffer, she seems to have no problem with it, but i just cant get over myself and watching somebody drift away while i wait. It hurts so much and the things she said about me how amazing i am and how bad she wants me to stay there, but i just cant im falling into depression again. I told her im gonna stay but i dont know if im capable im just hurting myself. 3 years of this and just when you think you get out of it it crawls back so fast ahhhhh.

"I am a caucasian male , age 30. I wont get into complete vivid details of the numerous conditions i have ( childhood exc ) , this started happening when i was around 27. An ex and i whom spent well over 10 years together had broken up due to her unfaithfulness exc. Something happened and although i have spoken to many people and therapists. I feel like the real me is dead. And i am a walking multiple personality basket case , im always being someone im not , no freinds , all that which i had motivation for and excitement for is nothing. I am an empty shell. We got back together and she informed me that she was pregnant by a fling , which was planned , please note that we tried for kids for 6 years prior and she was found out to be infertile unless on fertility meds , long story short she aborted that child and got pregnant with me. Given that the situation prior was hard enough , the trauma and pure gut wrenching pain of questioning the pregnancy as well as my family questioning took its tole , work deterriorated and personal happyness was destroyed.

I dont know why , but i feel that its the logical thing to do. Given my situations. Im always being someone im not , multiple people. I make rash decisions that have and ruined my life. I have always wanted to be a police officer and thats thrown out due to tatoo policys , people have always avoided me because im either creepy or just weird. My family has abandonned me legit. I just work and sit in a basement. My suicide will commence in july 15th 2020. I plan to make it as suddle as possible , maybe an accident.

"I messed up. I screwed up the trust I've built with my boyfriend who has paranoia.

My entire life I was afraid of confronting people. I got it from my parents. I would either get yelled at asking for help or they would help. It scared me that I couldn't confront normally as anyone else would. My boyfriend had problems carrying from toxic relationships he's had and I felt like he was bringing it into ours. I wanted to help him but instead of confronting him first I confronted a friend and told them what was up. The promises I've made to him, broken. I wanted to help him first and I felt that it was necessary. Then, because of all of this, my best friend and he argued and argued and they broke off, a lot of details here are not added because it's personal but I just felt like I'm at the bottom of the food chain. Why be here if I just destroy everything. I broke the trust I've built into him, I ruined a friendship I've had and one of the ones my boyfriend had. I feel like I just don't deserve to exist and I've always felt like that from all the mistakes I make. I just wanted to help but instead, I bring misery. I'm sorry for posting this and dabbling on but I felt like I needed to just choke something out because my heart just hurts from repeating the same thoughts in my head that I'm the worst and it would've been better if my suicide attempt two years ago worked. Guilt is eating me out and I don't know what to do. I want help but I don't know what to do. I can't get therapy until September and I feel like even if I did, nothing would change what I do and how I hurt everyone around me.",4

"I just don't know how to be normal anymore. The littlest things can set me off. I'm always hurting peoples feelings with jokes I make, then I always say ""Don't be so sensitive"" when I know for sure it was MY fault they got offended. It's hard for me to take responsibility.

I also feel very alone, and I don't mean the sense of friendships. I'm talking about romantic relationships. I've had about 4 or 5 concussions, and I say that because I know I've definitely had some that weren't diagnosed as I used to box. It's just really hard for me to say what I want to say. I fumble my words a lot, and I noticed that after my most recent concussion about a month ago.

For example, one thing I said that I regret was calling a girl a ""dyke"" because she said something rude to me. What I said was so uncalled for, especially since I knew she was bisexual. I feel like trash because I don't say things like this (homophobic) all the time per-say, but that is just an example of how offensive and unregulated the stuff that comes out of my mouth on the daily.

I constantly have to be high on marijuana most of the time to keep my mood up and I don't want to be like that. The weed just makes things worse for me when I'm not high because I get even more irritable then I was before I smoked and I go through bad anxiety and psychosis episodes.

I also feel like a failure. I am in my senior year of high school and I feel hopeless. My grades are all F's and I don't know what to do anymore. I plan on going to trade school after this year but I probably won't follow through on that because I never follow through on anything I want to do, as my anxiety prevents me from doing lots of stuff.

I think about suicide but the thought scares me and it's just and endless cycle of just that and it sends me down a dark hole in my thoughts. I feel hopeless like nothing can help me anymore.

Also, I don't want to sound pathetic but its what I am. I told the girl I like that I liked her. She said doesn't reciprocate those feelings but it hurt when she said she liked me 2 years prior. It especially hurt because I liked her back then as well. Once again my anxiety prevents me from being happy and thats all I want, is too be happy again. It's been at least 4 years of feeling like this.

"Hello everyone. I'm sorry for taking your time, but I need help. 

A bit of a back story to my life: I come from a not-so-well-off family, mom left me (9at the time) and my sister (14 at the time)in my father's care (she left the country), to earn more so we could at least have a bread on the table. My sister took her frustrations on me, was being bullied at school gor not having a functional family, my father distanced himself from us... life generally sucked. I was also getting (at the time undiagnosed) migraines, which my sis and dad kept insisting that I'm lying about for attention, was even punished for it. So I stoped talking. After a long 2 years, my mother had applied for divorce, mainly due to my father's threats and mental bias. By what I saw, my father was threatening my mother to throw me and my sis in the streets if she didn't send more money. The divorce was messy and a lot of shit throwing at eachother. It ended with my sis insisting that we need to stick toghether and since she was older, she insisted that we stay in my home country with my dad, also to spite my mother, who she now hated. The next years were rough, a lot of screaming, bullying, hitting, starving... list is long. (Just on a side note, I ended up climbing trees from windows to grab aome nasty fruit for my class mates and trading them and homework for sandwiches. Did I care I was millimeters away from dying, NAH!) Highschool was worse with the bulying, mom was still away but now, she had someone (she met the guy before the divorce, but I can't blame her. She was alone in a country where my people were, and still are, very hated). We tried to get mom to get cuatody of me, but for reasons I still can't wrap my head around, it failed. Well, her (now) husband lost his crap, and kept repeating to me and making me feel like pure shit because the process failed. It did fail because of me, yes, but as I said previously, I still don't remember why I said what I said and what happened. Years later, they decide to go to a better place, Australia! After 4 years of struggles and 3 lost cases, I finally get to get my (20 y/o) ass there with my mother. I get a boyfriend, her husband turns out to be the dickhead of the year and, long story short, I get kicked out of the house after only 1 year living with them, and end up with extremely severe anxiety because of him.

This year I turned 24. I still live with my boyfriend, who took me in. But here is where the problem is. I want to end it. So much stuff is going on, and all I can say is that it's too much. I was diagnosed (discovered by accident) with clinical depression at the age of 16, and was never addressed. I always felt like something was wrong, but every time I tried to look for help, was told to suck it up by the counselors and psycologists (admittedly, I only worked the courage to go 3 times in my life).

But in the past 3 years, I felt lost. I've been depressed and can't seem to get over it. I find no joy in life or any of the things I used to love. I have no reason, energy or motivation to move on. I drive to work, I work, put a fake smile, drive back, sleep, agrue, sleep, repeat. I feel so angry all the time, I ended hating myself more than ever, and I don't know why! I feel my partner is not there, he's stuck in his games and not engaging, and I think this is because I put too much pressure on him. I can't see my mother to talk to her, my sister doesn't talk to me and I had to go full no contact with my father. And whenever anyone asks me how I am, all I can do is repeat ""I'm fine"" and smile. I hate it... I hate it all....

Sorry for putting this all out, but I had enough of this. I want to smile, to enjoy things, but I can't... I need help. I knew I had to write this after I watched some reddit reading and was crying like an idiot at how accurate and true the things said in said reading were (the topic was ""What do you wish more people knew about depression"")

Once again, I'm sorry for taking your time, but if you read it all, thank you. Thank you so much for listening.

Also, dear moderators, if this is not in accordince to the rules, please do delete it. Thank you.",4
"Im just so done. Her comment threw me into a spiral and Im not doing well mentally. I have no support system outside of her or my dad, so idk what to do anymore. Im thinking of quitting school since Ive been doing college work for 3 years and Im nowhere close to a degree yet - Im still in CC.",2
"See, to start things off I want to say that I dont think I'm depressed, but many of my friends opinions and other things make me worry. I'm not suicidal or do any self harm, just one thing really scares me and that's desensitization. I'm only 14-15 and I haven't felt any heavy feeling in a good 1.5 years now, I feel void. I'm fairly scared of coming out because I feel I wont be taken seriously, I truely have no clue what to do.",4
I can't talk to my therapist about it because she only wants to know if â€œI'm safeâ€. It just seems like she doesn't actually care about me. They just don't want to look bad for business I guess.,0
"I had a baby recently and regret ever getting pregnant so much. My PTSD is back after giving birth full force and my life is unlivable. My body is ruined. Maybe i'm stupid but I didn't know it would destroy my body or I would have aborted. And I know that's horrible and sounds super vain. But it's not vain. I don't care how i look in clothes or what other people think of how I look. I just need to feel comfortable in my body and like it belongs to me. And I don't. As a result I can't not wear a bra even in my own home because I have so much anxiety about it. Even if it's just me and the baby at home. So i'm always uncomfortable. If someone rings the buzzer i jump and scream. I can't let my partner see my body at all. The thought sends me into a panic attack. So we can't shower together, I sleep fully clothed, I have to go to a different room to change and close the door. No sex ever again. I know he's just going to hate me one day and leave anyway because me being so messed up will drive him away. I can't live my life like this. I can't be a mom like this. 

I'm waiting to talk to my therapist again on Monday to explain it all and see if he can help with the PTSD. I have ppd too but that's not even a big deal. I have had PTSD and depression all my life. I can cope with some moderate depression. But these body issues I will never be able to get over. 

I'm waiting to see how my body ""settles"" but that's going to take 6 months to 2 years. If I can't live with it i'm going to kill myself. I can't live the rest of my life like this in agony every day. It's only been 2 months but I don't know how much longer I can wait. I don't know if I can make it to 6 months.",3
"I can do errands and generally go to work. I can make myself go to therapy for now. I'm exhausted the whole time, and it's hard to concentrate, but I can do it. I will admit I've called into work 7 or 8 times this year though. I usually only call in once or twice a year. Whoops. 


So I can generally do what I need to do. I can't cook or maintain my personal hygiene though. I've just been microwaving leftovers that someone else made or eating fast food. I haven't showered in 4 weeks. I only brush my teeth once a day, and even then it's half-assed. I haven't brushed my hair in a few days. I lay around when I'm not running errands/working/going to therapy and it makes my body sore as hell.


I've been getting about 4 hours of sleep on average a night. I haven't hung out with anybody in about a month and a half. I text friends, but can't talk about anything other than...ugh. How I feel. It's pathetic. 


Am I really depressed if I can ""function""? I mean, really. I can do the big things I need to do. Just not the small things.",1

"I can't keep going.

I try and try to be a good person and every time I turn around the world takes something from me. I can't afford to live anymore. The state of the world makes me sick. My family is so splintered. I lost my dad and my mother is so beyond done dealing with my messed up self it makes my chest hurt.

I never wanted to be this. I wanted to make my family's life better but here I am a failed 38 year old man who can't even support himself let alone help those I love.

I don't know where to turn. Doctors push so many drugs on me and I feel like I can not even think because of it therapy just wants me to blame my father and I do t want to do that, I loved him and he loved me. 

I hate myself and who I have become. I want a normal life. I want to support myself and help my loved ones. I was the rock and now I'm just a pile of shit.

I can't do this. I hate it, I hate me. I do not remember a time when my chest did not hurt from this. I'm so tired. I want to love someone, I want to be better. I'm going to die like this and I can't stand the thought.

How can I legally die? I just want to stop being the burden. People will forget me quickly, I provide nothing to this world. 

I've never kissed a woman. I'm a damn loser.

I can't even imagine having a child because I would never want this to pass down to them. The thought of that makes me sick. I just want love, of any type. I just want to hold someone.

I hate myself so much and I can't stop.",4
"I have been struggling a great deal lately. I suffered an injury and then had to have surgery and then suffered complications. I continue to be in pain everyday. Since the injury happened at work, I was forced to resign my position in order to get a worker's comp settlement. I used the money to pay rent and bills and medical expenses but now it's gone. I have been looking for work since November. And I mean really looking. Every single day. I have had several interviews, but literally have been told multiple times that I was their second choice
I am completely out of money. I am almost out of food. All of my utilities are so far behind, every day I expect them to be turned off. I have received a 3 day notice for my rent. I an about to be homeless. 
I do not have any family. I have been sick for so log now, I have very few friends left. I have tried every agency that I can for help and I an repeatedly turned away because they don't have the funds to help me. And they say even if they did, what about next month? They are right. There is no point.",2

Until my grandma passed away so I couldn't save her up the pain.

But I'm suffering so much. No one fucking likes me. And I don't say anything but god it hurts. 

It hurts being alone. 

It hurts being rejected. 

I've tried to keep going. And perhaps tomorrow I'll wake up and go to work like nothing happened.

But tonight I wanna pretend I'm dying. That when I fall asleep it'll be the last time I see this fucking planet. That when I wake up I won't remember anything. I'll be free.",4
I have a reoccurring day dream where I have to grab all my belongings and food and live in a room in my house for the rest of my life and I find it very hard to snap out of it. Normally it's the bathroom because it's the smallest room and my brain hates me.

"I'm 38 and always felt like a screw up.

I'm one of those people that when things start looking good, I'll always fund a way to mess it up and end up back at square one. 

I'm constantly down and always thinking about ending my life, like every day.

All that's holding me back is the thought of leaving my 2 young kids, but it also depresses me more knowing how much of a loser their dad is.

I've tried 3 overdoses with Zopiclone which did nothing but I have been practicing with hanging while sitting, I came close to passing out 3 days ago with belt in door but fought to save myself as I knew mrs and kids were due home.

I cant shake the thoughts.

Debt + gambling addiction + pure unhappy",3
"I just can not keep doing this anymore. I keep reaching out for help, doctors push pills on me (I'm on five now) and therapists just try to push me into blaming my dead father. 

I can't afford my home. I can't afford my bills. I can't afford food and even the subreddits that claim to offer help just delete my posts because I lurk and my account doesn't have hundreds of karma.

I do not know what to do. I cry constantly. I hate my life and myself. I can't sleep I can't eat. 

I try to open up to people and they look at me like a monster.

I am a monster.

I'm about to lose my home and I have nothing left to sell to try to hang on to it. I sold all my dads belongings to make ends meet, he left those to me so I could have a good fun life and here I am a piece of garbage who can't even work a part time job to buy groceries. 

The state turns me away because I have income ($944/mo in disability).

I'm done. I can't do this. Why am I fighting? For who? I'm alone. My chest hurts, my eyes hurts. My head spins and I do not even know if any of this makes sense. I just can't keep this up. I have been fighting since I was a child, I'm a 38 year old man (ha) now. What do I have to offer to this world? All I am is a leech. I have no skills. I was never good in school because of my mental illness and no one would diagnose it.

"I feel really worthless because The only thing keeping me alive is a video game coming out in 15 days (DOOM eternal) and it won't even last for long. I've been told to tell CAHMS if anything is bothering me but anxiety tells me no.

"I had a thought today while I was mulling over what a shitty mood I've been in lately. Basically I was thinking about how my latest depressive episode was lasting longer than usual, about how tired I was and all I wanted to do was take a long ass nap and just chill for a few days- I wanted to not have to deal with all the responsibilities on my plate right now, and thought about how great it would be if I could have someone â€œtake my shiftâ€ for my life this week. 
And it just popped into my head that maybe that's what happens when we get thrown back into depressive episodes- maybe someone has been feeling so shitty for such a long time that the universe has decided to give them a break and I'm the one that's been chosen to â€œtake the shiftâ€, bearing some heavy emotions, etc. And that when I'm lucky enough to have some free time for an afternoon snooze or just to watch a movie, someone else is taking my â€œshiftâ€ for a while. 

Idk. 

Feels like I'm connected to a bigger picture in a contributing way somehow!",0
"I have nothing but negative thoughts all the time, I can remember when it started but it has gotten so bad I tend to cry myself to sleep if I even can sleep. I don't know who to talk to and don't really have anyone to talk to so I just want to dump everything here and maybe get some guidance before I do something to make the pain go away. I never see my parents due to my mom and step dad being too busy with work and running a business and my dad is probably somewhere rotting in Arizona. My sister is deployed in the navy and the other ran away a few years ago and haven't heard from her, and my older brother is a drug addict that cut ties with us a long time ago. 

I don't want to message a suicide hotline out of fear they will send an ambulance or force me into a hospital forcing bills on me that I can not afford, and I have no one close to talk to about it. My situation is, growing up my parents both lived in different bad areas with little money. I was never smart or talented at anything besides having an over active imagination. I always had a learning issue both with paying attention and remembering information regardless of how hard I tried. Didn't have a lot of friends and ended up dropping out of high school. About 3 years ago I went back and got my Adult Diploma with the hopes it would be enough to get me on my feet. I'm now almost 26 and just a few months ago after I saw someone about my mental health I found out I have ADD. So some things where answered there, but it didn't help much. 

The small amount of friends that I have, have become aware of my increasing depressed emotions and have tried to help but for the most part, they seem to pay no mind to it. I've working dead end jobs for most of my adult life until recently when I took a boot camp course in the Information Technology field. I then interned for 5 weeks and after got a position working for a small company as an IT help desk technician under a 3 month to perm contract. Or that's what they told me during the interview. I never did anything IT related and the contract was constantly extend by 3 months until my 9th month there. In that time, I've worked for some bad companies, but I have never worked somewhere that treated there (specifically the US employees) so poorly. They then after promising to increase my pay hired me on full time as salary, and cut my pay thinking I wouldn't notice. I then secretly started looking for new positions starting last July until November of last year when I was tired of they way they have treated me for over a year and without thinking, just left, even though I have monthly bills. 

On top of the learning problems, I also have extreme anger problems and am very VERY impatient. As far as work goes, I have applied to countless IT positions since last July, with professional help updating resumes and cover letters, and re learning (trying to) as much IT knowledge as I can after using pretty much none of it at my last job and forgetting almost all of it, but I've gotten nothing. I have had 2 companies interview me and reject me after the 2nd or 3rd interview, and all of the other countless companies I've applied to have either flat out rejected me or have not said anything. I have next to nothing left with money and if I don't find something soon, I will lose everything and I can only imagine how bad my credit will be and the law suits to follow. Other than job things, I have never been in a real relationship, I never see my family even though I literally live with my mom and step dad, I almost never see my friends, I have an extreme hate for people I'm assuming due to everything I've had to go through over the years, and every day I spend hours trying to teach myself new things and applying for any position available that could possible help me with my situation, but since the last interview rejection and the constant no reply and email rejections, I can't anymore. 

I've tried so hard to make things better for myself, seeking medical help, close support from family and friends, and will power, but it's always one step forward and then being launched back. I'm tired of starting over, I'm tired of only knowing rejection and being ignored not just from jobs but from everything. I have become so angry and hate filled that I can't see happiness in anything. I used to love movies and video games and can't find joy in those. The only piece of escape I have day to day is music, because it almost thinks for me. I'm listening to it but I feel like it's also listening to me, feeling my constant pain and emotional wreck. Everyone says it will get better, but I've been at this for so long and it only keeps getting worse. I have put the effort in but it's like some deity is purposefully trying to prevent me from being happy or making myself successful, and over the past few weeks, I can't stop thinking of killing myself. Making this awful pain go away and not feeling anything anymore. The only thing that holds me back is the thought of what comes after. Possible non existence which I can't even comprehend. Just not knowing is the only thing holding me back, but even that fear is starting to go away and taking an early exit seems more and more like the best option.

I apologize for the extremely long post, maybe just a way to leave a small mark on existence to make myself feel a little better. I don't seem myself feeling any better even if my hard work eventually gets me anywhere, a family, a job that actually pays enough for me to live on my own, not constantly worrying if I have enough for food and water or if I have to cut that out to make my payments. It's hard to feel happy or accomplished when all you know is failure and loss. There is more but I feel like I've said enough if anyone even reads this. I've re read this and gone over it a few times and I just keep feeling worse and adding more to it. Thank you to whoever takes the time to read this",4
"I got way too attached and when she ghosted me I wanted to hate her, but I couldn't. So I hated myself. At one point the only thing holding me back was the thought of living if I failed. 
Fast forward a year out of no where she attempts suicide. It made me realize how much I still cared about her. I don't feel like I deserve to be as broken down as I am though. I cared so much about her and she probably didn't even think of me for a moment. I was just another stupid dude to her. Everything about it is fueling my self hatred.",4
"Just a little insight about my life 


3 years ago I lost the last vehicle I would ever own

3 years ago I lost the I only place i had to live

Ive lost at least 2-3 jobs in a 3 year span

2 years ago I lost the girl i loved

1 year ago I lost a career I was failing in

6 months ago i was eating good, showering daily I got a job and started fixing my life made plans fo get another car pay some debt

Today I am jobless, homeless, hungry don't shower often dont eat much, isolate my self



Because I miss life. I miss going out and being able to socialize and I miss like dating and stuff and wearing clean clothes paying bills on time and not being behind miss having a drivers license and not being in fear everytime I get behind the wheel, miss having the Apartment for having girls just come over when ever they want, I miss eating good I miss shopping for things, 

Im barely living and have been doing that for the past 3 years 

Everytime I get a job I try and fix my credit, and I can never seem to keep with it

I have to live my life with zero payments and buy everything with cash because I clearly can not keep up with them 


Do things really get better with time?",2
"I don't even know how to start, I always thought about one thing that always tortures my brain: Everyone are the same, but I am not. When I was a child, being child was the perfect excuse to hide my condition: I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to prolong a conversation, I don't know anything about being sociable. In the other hand, I was (and I am) really smart, but I don't really qualify myself about something special, because people are so stupid to think about being self-centered, instead of thinking about the personality itself, that's maybe one of the thing I don't even comprehend about society, well I continue, being able to do whatever you want its something amazing, I felt (I feel) I got the most powerful superpower, being able to think about something interesting to do and make it real, make it like I was professional on something, but if you can't even talk, even express yourself, your brain, all of your amazing ideas are taking down to trash, to something miserable, how much kids, teens worried about the things other people say (I worry too), but I'm 100% sure they can shine if they are with the correct people, ask me, I'm 22 now, in 22 years, Why didn't I find anyone like me?, anyone who I can talk about interesting things and not about superficial and stupid things, anyone who takes the life like a poetry, with right values, anyone who understands me, anyone who I can be myself

I hated my school partners, and they always thought about things on how to ruin my day, I didn't understand why being so small, being so tiny they were so disrespectful to each other, I lived on a city that I can't even pronounce it's name because is the reason of all my misfortunes, people so damn vulgar, so damn low they can't even teach their kids how to be kind, how to be respectful to anyone. I learn about pride, that keep me away from bullying, they don't even know why they bullied me, bullies tend to attack people about their body, about if they are stupid, about a condition, they just attack me because it was me, and I know, they smell it like dogs, possessed maybe, because I didn't find a reasonable reason to understand what they bullied me, but in the middle of that, I thought why just can't we be friends? Why do we attack to each other? Only because I can't be vulgar like you? They is the reason why I hate my ethnicity, this stupid language called spanish talked only by freaking stupid people, because I learned about they, every single piece of word they say, why my country is infested with third-world-people, they are way too worried about lgbt and inclusiveness, why didn't they included me on society?

There was a guy, Alvaro C. was and still is his name, he was the most disgusting, profane, putrid and revolting person I ever met, he was just a compulsive masturbator, obsessed with pornography, I remember when he checked the teacher computer just for looking for sexual content, when he masturbates in class, I couldn't care less about his life except for one thing, he didn't let me breathe one miserable day when I was in school, he just looked for me to having some daily fun, let's make this piece of s**t even more s**t than he actual is he thought, I cried trying to understand why me? what did I got in myself that makes me so despreciable?, he didn't know about what thing inserted in my mind, now I'm him, now it's me who have a problem with porn addiction

When I was 14, I decided to play guitar, not only that, now I'm feeling that I'm able to put some music on the radio with some effort and money, but I don't have the energy left to do something, actually I just don't have energy to do nothing more than just laying in my bed and watching these repulsive videos that I hate, but I can't left behind for some reason, this thing is just consuming my brain, all my abilities, my smartness, my heart, my soul, I want to leave it but I'm thinking that I have no reason to do that, because for me now life is just pointless, is just about being stupid, thinking stupid, talking stupid, living stupid, don't try to be some special for this world because this world will take you and make you descend down to their level, descend down to hell, and if you make it to the top maybe it's because you are like they by default, I got ideas, still have some beautiful ideas, but I'm alone, waiting for someone to help me that will never come, suicide is just a boring option, I know if I just die no one will notice and I hate that, I will not take that option because I don't want to give them the pleasure of that, it's freaking hypocrite when these criminals of society cry to a fallen relative, cry is a emotion just for good people so you know now why they don't cry me but instead cry to themselves, you may not believe in God, but you can make sure the Devil is in one of us waiting just for destroy everyone else and every piece of you, disguised as everything you know, the more you think everything is normal, the more you are far away from comprehend that life, this world f***ing hates you, that's not a advice, that's what I understood in 22 years.",1

"As an individual who is friends with or have family members that suffer from depression, Ive always wondered, what is something that can help depression that a therapist is lacking? From my personal experience, Ive always heard that having a therapist to treat your depression can be helpful sometimes but many times, from what I hear, the patient continues to suffer from depression. What is something that others can do to help a victim of depression? From your personal experience, what do you believe could be extremely helpful when treating or helping those with depression? I am genuinely curious and eager for ANY feedback due to my desire of assisting others.",4
"My bedroom and bathroom look like a hurricane struck them and I can't even eat normally, if at all. I can barely move. That's not an exaggeration, just doing simple tasks feels like agony.

I know he loves me and that he's concerned but he has his own problems and I'm only adding to his. I don't recognize myself anymore. I don't know who the fuck I am. I dread the future. Watching my boomer parents suffer from addiction, depression and loneliness and struggle to afford retirement doesn't give me high hopes. I despise the fucking world. I want no part of any of this cruel, selfish, violent, disgusting place. I don't have the energy to partake in this rat race just to survive.

What bothers me is the soul crushing loneliness, I havent had a girlfriend in years and I haven't been physically touched in what seems like forever.

"For a few years now i've been having these 4-5 month periods of just malaise and insecurity. I feel so selfish writing this. My parents refuse to get me tested for depression, So i can't say that I have it. I am ugly. No one wants to talk to me because i'm not cool enough. If they are seen with me theyre automatically labeled as un-cool. I hate everyone. theyre so fucking selfish and fake. To me it hurts more to be rejected by a potential friend than a potential girlfriend. The only friends I have see that i'm sad or im not motivated, and they try and force me to open up, and when they finally force me to they try to become my therapist. Then I become a burden to them and they feel the need to check up on me. And then they use my problems against me if I make them mad. I am so fucking selfish and everyone lies to me. Recently one of my only friends, a girl, i fell in love with, backstabbed me. She had been for many months now. I confessed my love for her 7 months ago and we've been â€œmore than friendsâ€ for a while.. I realized that she only did this because she felt bad for me. She leaked my affectionate love notes and my personal problems to my only friends, who then laughed at me, called me a simp and stopped talking to me. I'm too affectionate with people. My past relationships have always failed because i'm not a strong independent man. I'm a needy baby when it comes to the relationship and no girl wants a needy baby let alone an ugly fuck like me. I see girls at my school who look exactly like the girl who backstabbed me and it fucking eats me away inside knowing I have no chance. I want out. I just want to press escape and quit. I'm too scared to jump off a building and I only would feel comfortable with a gun. But I don't know if this is for real or just angst..? I just want to stop going to school everyday seeing everyone have friends, girlfriends, good looks, making experiences knowing I cant achieve that. Its like my life is just showing me what I cant have and I want it to stop. Its eating away at me.",1
"Recently, im going through a severe depressive episode and I did some things I would not have otherwise done that are now affecting my mental health further and affecting someone I love. 

I would like to hear those with severe depression talk about whether they feel they have the ability to consent and make decisions on sensitive matters during severe depressive episodes.

It feels like society tells everyone that it is their fault if they make a bad decision, that they are responsible for their choices, and most dont understand mental illness properly and to me its not that black and white. 

I want to know whether you think you truly have the capacity to be at fault for a decision youve made if it is something you would not have done outside an acute depressive episode.

Four abilities are usually assessed with decision making when I was looking around. The only studies I found were for research purposes (which saddens me, but thats a whole other topic).

The four abilities:
Understanding
Appreciating
Reasoning
Ability to express a choice

Now I cant say I know the exact ways to interpet these 4 things right now without further research but, do you feel you possess these abilities during a severe depressive episode? Do you possess some and not others? Does it vary? 

My answer would be during a severe depressive episode, I do not possess any of these reliably at every moment. It is not consistent enough for me to able to say I possess any of them during these times.

"I just turned 20 and am beginning college this year since I haven't had money for it and I don't count with my moms support in any way. Last year a lot of things happened that made me spiral into a terrible depression and lost my job because of it. Since then things have just progressively gotten worse and I can't find a new job. Where I live there isn't much places to work at since it's a small town yet I can't seem to find in one place. It makes me super sad to see that everyone is doing fine while I'm doing nothing with my life and it makes me feel like a failure. I know I could be doing so much better and greater things but I just don't know where to start. I wish I had my moms support like other kids do but it's not the case and I have to do things on my own, but I feel like everything is a giant and I'm a speck of dust, what can I do to better my situation or feel better and more positive about it?",2
"on the morning of February 16 2020 i took my cat to the emergency vet to have her checked out. she was extremely skinny and was not moving and hadnt eaten or used the bathroom in 2 days. she barely wanted to be around anyone and her muscules were so weak she couldnt even use her back legs or stand. she would just drag herself to where she wanted to go then lay down exhausted. i thought she was going to die the night before but miraculously she survived but was still extremely weak and exhausted looking.

i put her in her pet cage and drove to the emergency vet. the vet examined her and immediately became accusatory and critical of me and how my kitty got into the position that she was in, asking me every question under the sun what did i give her to eat? whats her past medical history? and maybe about 40 other questions. even calling my cat a train wreck. she was in horrible condition and he kept telling me things such as ""well if you wouldve taken her to your regular vet and had checkups sooner, all of this couldve been prevented"" ""you should've given her her medicine. hyperthyroidism is manageable and bc you didnt do this and that your cat is in the condition that shes in"" which just made me feel so damn guilty. i wanted to take her away right then and there. he then tells me that he couldnt feel her liver and that she only had 25% of her kidneys working and that she was extremely dehydrated.

he mentioned giving her medicine and iv drips and changing her diet but because of the state she was in, he said it wouldn't do much at all at this point because her kidneys would eventually fail. so then he suggests euthanasia. and my heart dropped like a rock. i didnt want to do it. i wanted to give her the medicine i was hell bent on it. ill pay it now, i dont care what the price is ill pay it now! but he kept pushing me and my sister to sign up for a credit plan to pay for it because he simply ""didnt want to be the bank"" he even said that we could give her all of the medicine and change her diet etc and theres a possibility that it still wont work at all because of how debilitated she was. 

eventually our family made the decision to have her put to sleep on the same day as the visit. we had a previous cat who passed away due to kidney failure and we didnt want her to go through the same thing. we all snuggled her, kissed her and pet her until she breathed her final breath on the table. it was heart wrenching. we didnt want to bring her home because we all live with out 80 year old grandmother who prior to having her put to sleep, my grandmother would see her dragging her legs and see how weak and exhausted she looked and would start crying and saying how she didnt want to see the cat suffer like that anymore. we didnt want to bring her home because we didnt want anything to happen to grandma so we had everything done in one day and it all happened so fast. im still torn about it. i feel like i can go back in time and pull her away from the table, and bring her to present day. 

i miss you so much misty, my little baby. it felt like we all yanked you out of this world too soon and thats what drives me crazy. the regular vet i tookher to long ago when we first found out about it told us all that she had hyperthyroidism. all 3 of us were in charge of making sure she got her medicine until she finished it, and then it dwindled down to just me having the responsibility. i was in a very stressed out mindset between my shit job with no set hours, and taking care of my grandmother who has dementia.we have to make sure she dosent wander outside or anything. and had completely forgotten/ was counting on other family members to give her her medicine because i was not home. i had forgotten that she even took medicine at all because she was doing so well. she was eating, and playing until about last year when i went to have her ears checked. thats when they reminded me. and it all went downhill. 

so again i gave her her medicine and she finished it. only to find out this year she would have to be put to sleep. i never intended to hurt you misty, i never wanted you to get so sick. every morning i cry my eyes out wishing you were here with me on my bed or licking my hand or even meowing that cute little ""hello"" meow you used to do. every day i think about the what ifs and the if onlys. i cant even smell or look at certain things anymore, i cant smile or be happy anymore without my baby. 
i bought a box cutter last week because i was seriously contemplating ending my own life because of the horrible guilt. i feel like i murdered that cat. i feel like i purposefully let her get sick and die . i felt like she didnt need to be euthanized. it was my responsibility to make sure you got your medicine and i fucked up so bad. i dont want to live anymore feeling like this. im so sorry my sweet baby kitty. how can i help my grandmother if i failed to help you? i feel like im the only one in the world dealing with this situation. i know im not, but i just want to fucking die. i hate existing. everyday i wake up im reminded that my cat is gone. my best friend, my baby is dead and i caused it and i want to throw up. i hate living i want to die and just not feel anything im so sorry misty im so sorry",3
"I am sorry for any error, english not my first language and I'm very anxious right now. It's a long story and it's kind of confusing, but here we go.

I am depressed since ever, I don't know when it started or how it started, the only thing that I know is that I am depressed since I was a kid and things is getting worse and worse. I was in big crisis in the last two years, life was not what I was expecting to be and things are so complicated, I tried, tried and I am still being fucked by things. So my cousin lives in another country and I asked her if I could stay with her for 3 months until things get better and I can organize myself to live here. So I moved here one month ago and I am trying to build things to live here. Maybe another country, another life maybe things get better, I don't know, I am trying. 
When I asked her if I can stay in her home she was really kind and supportive, it was in august/2019. Then I got here last month and she isn't nice at all. She wakes me up on purpose, she says bad things like ""I can watch my tv cause you are sleeping on the couch"" (the couch is ""my bed"" now). She insinuated that I should find a place for me since the day I arrived here. I try the most to help with things, I clean the house, I wash her clothes, I go the supermarket, I buy the food, I cook the food, I try to be outside the most so I give her a space. And still she's acting bad towards me. I don't know what to do since I asked her to be here for 3 months and after one month things are bad like this. The thing is that I feel so lonely right now and then I tried to talk with her yesterday and she was so mean, she say things like ""people are lonely"", ""grow up that life is hard"", ""cut off this depressed shit"" and others things really mean. The she got out and get really really really drunk with her friends and when she got home, she was another person, she was fun, making jokes, making me laugh, we watch a movie together and I was so fucked up with all the shit that I didn't sleep at all this night. Then she wakes up and starting a argument with me cause the dishes are dirty, but it was her, she used this last night when she was drunk, I tried to talk with her and she just said something like ""I hate that you here"". Now I am really confused. I know that I am not the asshole at all, but will I be the asshole if I kill myself now? I don't wanna kill myself because of her, I just wanna end it all cause I am so full of this shitty life. Will I be the asshole if I kill myself now here, away from my family, without saying goodbye, without people knowing what really happened to me?",4
I was getting better... until I ruined everything. Now everyone hates me. I have nobody to turn to until my therapy appointment on Saturday...it's too far away...how am I supposed to show my face in school tomorrow when even my best friends hate me now? I'm failing chemistry. My teachers a pervert. I want to die soon. I'm done.,2
"I think of myself as a spiritual person. I also think of myself of not ever belonging in this world. I don't understand why I was even born and placed into a life where I would be met with great obstacles. People, even family have been against me.

I'm tired of my dad being a pervert and my mom being oblivious or pretending not to notice. Their marriage is over anyway so she doesn't give a shit. I've talked to her about it and she just acted clueless and said she'd keep an eye out and then never spoke of it again.

"When I was in highschool the same thing, I was kind of happy to be around other people at school but obviously couldn't wait for the day to be over so I could go home. When I would get home I would just feel empty and lonely and sad. I remember when I met my first and only ever girlfriend, My depression literally disappeared the moment I met her. She left me 8 months later and there is a very good chance I will never speak to her again. It's been 3 months and I thought I was depressed before I had ever met a girl, but my god, the depression is 10x worse after I had one and she left. I'm so lonely even sometimes when I'm with friends I'm lonely. I can't take this anymore. ",4

"i've always been the type to be super unmotivated when doing things whether it's my âhobbiesâ or school and super introverted and not confident at all, but last year i joined a pageant and it really brought my confidence up for a while. I'm going to sound super conceited when i say this but during practice and rehearsals, the other girls were always asking me for advice on their walk and poses and saying that for sure i would win something. during the competition on nye i didn't make any mistakes with choreography and a few judges even came over and told me i was their number one pick for queen. there were 12 girls in the competition and 6 awards total. in the end i didn't win anything.... once again i'm going to sound so conceited but i personally felt super confident and i thought there was no way i would not get anything. but lo and behold i didn't win a single thing. I basically have solid evidence that 4/6 of the winners had hella connections and sponsors and that's why they won. but still... it just feels like i've wasted so much time and effort on something that was rigged in the first place. i was thinking that it would be like ânew year new me i might actually work harder for some things because winning would be proof that something can come out of it if i try hard enoughâ.... but now my confidence is at an all time low and idk what to do....

"I get this shit all the time. I'm not allowed to complain about my job because ""That's just how it is"". I tried opening up about recent depressive episode, I felt like I'd been kicked in the nuts because after weeks of work getting myself back on my feet my reward was my shitty ass job. The response I get from my family ""Suck it up, we've all been there"". 

I took a long hard fucking look at them, none of them are happy. They're just permanently angry. They're angry at people who have it better, yeah sometimes someone else gets lucky, but they're always just fucking resentful, never supportive. They think they're so much better, if they're better why are they angry? Why are they constantly complaining? If they're better than their managers, their bosses, their peers who got a promotion or the neighbours that have a stable family, why are they the ones with the loveless marriage, the ones that are passed up for promotions? 

They get fucking angry when I take time off for mental illness, ""If you're not in a mental hospital you're well enough to go to work"". Knowing them if I did go back to the psych ward they'd probably berate me for stealing money off of the NHS. I'd be open to them having issues that need to be worked out too, but I have no sympathy for them if they're gonna shit on other mentally ill folk instead of fixing themselves.

And if not? Fuck you. Just because you spend your time being angry, finding ways to put others down and digging yourself a bigger rut doesn't mean I have to. Yeah, I'm depressed, but so fucking what? I know I'm going to accomplish way more than they ever will. 

I spent the past week crying myself to sleep again. Need to go back to the Doctor and re-evaluate my meds, I don't know when I'll be able to go back to work full-time and I don't have any money for anything other than basic food and medication, but you know what? At least I'm not some self-righteous cunt who lives to ruin someone else's life. Fuck em. I'm gonna cry again tonight, most likely, but I'm not gonna blame it on someone else. I'm gonna fix my shit and at the very least not drag someone else down with me if I fail.

I'm so glad my Mom is one of the few genuinely caring people in this family. God knows I'd go insane without her support. It certainly makes up for everyone else.",4
"I've come to terms with me not being able to commit suicide just yet.

"hi --
For reference, I'm 21 and female.

First of all, I have a sister who is depressed. I know what that looks like: she contemplates the futility of her existence; she thinks she's worthless and generally has a deep-seated self hatred; on bad days, she cries herself to sleep and on the worst days she doesn't feel anything at all. I support her as best I can, but she often gets frustrated with me because I seem very far-removed from her mindset. I've always been a happy person, self confident (some might say to the point of arrogance), productive, etc. In particular, my sister cares a lot about what people think of her, and she often grows impatient with my inability to empathise with that position.

As much as I can enjoy living, I have no attachment to it. It's like the self-preservation instinct isn't there. I don't fear death, and I've experienced a good amount of physical pain in my life and I don't fear that either. I often just feel very removed from myself - disassociated - as if I'm looking from myself from very far away. Often I don't think of myself as a person but as a function of my activities (recently, a lot of work). Yes, I love people and I take an interest in intellectual material and I live both for the people in my life and my inner world, but if it makes any sense it often feels like my inner world itself is an external phenomenon, like I have no self. To borrow a line from Sylvia Plath: ""I am nobody. I have nothing to do with explosions."" And if it offers any insight: I don't cry very much, but when I do it's almost never for myself - it's for something larger and more abstract, like the Holocaust, or the rape crisis in India.

I just don't know what's wrong with me. I can be charming and engaged - I'm a creative type and very tactile. I'm confident in myself. Above all, I am happy making meaning within my own life, at peace with the knowledge that its significance is purely relative. But when I refer to myself it feels like I'm referring to some construction outside of myself, like the 'I' is still some distance away. For that reason, my self-preservation instinct in pretty switched off. I often think of death - not in a longing way, just in a morbidly curious way. Everything I value I can just as easily disengage, because those values seem arbitrary. The world is a beautiful place but it will keep turning without me (and everyone else). I don't think I'll ever kill myself, but my detachment sometimes scares me.

Is this normal, to an extent? Or is something wrong with me?",4
"Whether I have consciously or unconsciously pushed people away, I am now here alone. Questions cloud my mind such as will I ever be the person that I once was? Will I ever feel some sort of acceptance from myself and from others? Will all of this become too much and I end up killing myself because of it? Ive started to self destruct and I am now drinking almost everyday. I cry because I dont know what else to do and there seems to be no hope left. I feel stuck and I know that this cant last much longer. Its been about a decade now and time is ticking.",3
I have shut down my Snapchat and instagram accounts so I don't see shit that will bring me down even more. Being lonely sucks but this has seemed to slightly help. Anyone else have trouble comparing themselves on social media? Stay well people. ,4
"Why is it so damn hard to find any sense of purpose? I wake up every morning feeling like a disappointing peace of garbage who can't accomplish anything and it's eating away at me.

Maybe tomorrow will be better.",4
"My job sucks. I know everybody and their mothers complain about working, but my job SUCKS. The bosses are total unprofessional cunts, they are uncouth and rude, they yell at everyone. They want me to do shit that I can't do.

I work at a tv repair company. they take broken tv's, they fix em, they sell em. I broke one. They are going to sue me. I reckon i have a good case, because the tv was in a prone position to get damaged. And i know i can win the case. but im still nervous and anxious. 

I really want to quit. but i need the money. I need advice.",2
"I've felt proud of my success in overcoming most of my depression in 2016, and at least making some progress in seeing most people as good. But the end of this year has really taken a toll on me, especially after the election. It's not because of who people voted for, but because of all the horrible things on the Internet that resulted from it! I've always taken comments a little more seriously than most, but why not? If people express what they're really thinking on the Internet, than how can you trust anyone? How many people are friends with another race, then talk s*** about them online? How many people lack empathy for others? How many people condemn others for trying to speak out against hate? How many people really care? 








Despite thinking all this, I've still resolved to being a kind person and trying to understand others, even if their way of thinking is unfathomable to me. But i don't know if i can keep up the faith if this is how people really think. I just want people to be caring, but i know it's not as simple as that. I thought i was getting better, but i just don't trust people anymore. It doesn't seem like anyone really cares.",5

"Hey, gunna keep this post short since I'm new to reddit and have no clue how to write.


I had a car crash today. Started in far left lane ended up in far right ditch. Snow flew over car while my friend and I slid about 15 meters in 2-3 feet deep of snow.


While this was happening, while my car was sliding towards the edge of the road I didn't feel any fear or anything.. I saw the oncoming ditch and just accepted the fact that there was nothing I could do. No fear.  I just reacted like a robot


Is this normal? People around me parents etc keep telling me I have depression because I don't show emotions at all to them. I'm starting to wonder myself.. to me it would seem normal to feel fear as I drove into a ditch at 100 kph.. but I didn't

Yeah, if it was that easy to change the neurological pathways in my brain, I would have done so a long time ago.

I want to be a popular twitch streamer and be good at video games. Who I am is pretty much the opposite of the kind of person you have to be to be that. You have to not care what others think to be a streamer, for when people inevitably say mean things about you. 

Basically I just found someone who is everything I want to be and everything I'm not, and I feel crushed. I don't even feel like a man, like if you laid out my attributes personality and emotionally-wise, I'd mostly match that of a woman's instead of a man's.

"Today is my birthday, it's supposed to be happy, I'm supposed to be happy. But thing didn't go well in my family, everyone was shouting and blaming each others, then my dad blamed it on me. I didn't care but tomorrow I have finals, I'm already stressed out enough. I wanted to go to a library or a coffee shop to study and forget all about this shit, but then my dad pointed at me and said that if I dared to go out I'm out forever. My mom told me to go my room (she's with me, she cares for me and she doesn't want me get hurt). So I went to my room. Inside, I still heard my dad blaming me for the nuisance I didn't ask for. I grabbed my phone and typed ""Thank you"" to all the texts my friends sent me to wish me a happy birthday. I tried to keep myself positive. 
But then the feelings just hit me hard. It was like a switch. The second after that, I already felt the water all over my face as I threw the glass on the floor. 
I felt...satisfied. The inside of me screamed ""Yes, you did it!"". I played safe with all my life, as the sweet little girl I was. But I know my emotions are unstable and my mental is crumble as hell. I never had the gut to do that, I've always swallowed all the hatred and sadness. So this time instead of crying and writing down all the sadness, I actually did something to show it. Of course my parents went to my room immediately. My mom didn't say much but my dad kept saying how disappointed he was. My dad had a perfect picture of a standard family which the females are always gentle and never fight back. So this incident must make him consider me a failure or something like that.
As I cleaned the mess, he just kept talking. Now he blamed it on my mom that she didn't raise me as a good obedient girl. It made me feel maybe I shouldn't have been born at all. I couldn't tell him that before I'm a girl, his daughter, I am a human. I have emotions. I'm not some doll to bend for his liking. 
I love my dad, I know he love me back too. But the difference between the ideal daughter of him and the actual me is miles away.  
I felt like because of the relationship between me and my family I'm living like a switch. I lost interest in living, I don't see the point of moving on. After all, my life will be a boring cycle. I'm scared that someday I will be crazy enough to actually end my life since I always have that thought at the back of my head. Today I already made the first step. I'm constantly pushed and pulled between living a normal life and depression. 
Tomorrow will be very awkward and stiff, I don't know how to face my family and tell them that I'm really crazy and dead inside.
Maybe I'm truly not suitable for living. For all the achievements and love I get, I still feel so empty. Nothing matters. I love some Kpop idols to learn to love someone wholeheartedly and think that they would love me back. It soothes my poor soul and I have someone to think of instead of thinking about my life. But I know it's just me finding reasons to continue living on.
I'm young, barely 20, good at school, well loved by friends and family. 
Still, I sucks at living. ",4
"The world  is covered in snow

Today's holiday I am still alone

This morning, she handed over the city

We've been dying spots on a white stump

Good reason for laughing without too much color

When thoughts go far from here

To save the world I have no idea

And everything eventually covered the snow

Like I was here, she was here

Someone like me was here before us

Someone like me was here

Someone like us, here after us

All is covered in the snow

Missing you to take me high

Who surrendered the city a long time ago

We're always on ice and everything's fine

Good reason for laughing in a day without numbers

What remains the same when you leave here

To save the world I have no idea

And everything eventually covered the snow

Like I was here, she was here

Someone like me was here before us

Someone like me was here 

Someone like us, here after us..",5
"I have a problem. I feel like I have that urge to be talking to someone 24/7, and whenever I talk to someone, I don't feel comfortable with them. 
I just want someone to want to talk to me out of sheer interest, not because they may feel obligated to or anything. I want a friend who always wants to talk to me and know about me or my day or whatever. 
How can I stop being so needy?
I hate it and it's drowning me...",5
"My boyfriend, a couple of his friends and a couple of my friends went out tonight to a bar. We were all kind of drunk and my boyfriend's friend asked a friend of mine if he take a shot from her belly button and she said no. He then asked me and u felt bad for him because he seemed really desperate, so I laid on the pool table and one of my friends poured the shot in my belly button and put a lemon in my mouth. He did the shot and then took the lemon out of my mouth with his mouth.


My boyfriend is very upset. I was buzzed and was just having a good time and I didn't mean anything sexual by it.


We have been dating for a couple of months.



What should I do to make things right with him? I love him a lot and only want to be with him. I tried talking to him and he gives me one word answers and walks away. I have been crying for the last hour and I don't know what to do. I have anger and emotional problems and I'm not sure what's wrong with me.


What should I do?

"i have great parents and all, but they dont seem to understand a teenager like me. they jump to conclusions about what i am thinking. i told them about this once and how i felt suicidal at times, and then said that they would kill themselves if i did. obv dont want that so now im stuck in a nice prelude to what will be hell. what do i do? i feel like i exhibit all of the symptoms of depression(weight gain, less sleep, loss of interest, constant tiredness and negativity). i have some good friends, even if i only see them at school, and my grades arent bad either. im still not happy. maybe im spoiled.

on a side note, does anyone else hate it when you have no motivation to do something, and then your parents say ""find the motivation""? i ask how, and then they say ""make your motivation"" LIKE DAMN. I'M NOT A FUCKING MOTIVATION FACTORY. is there anything like depressants without rx or anonymous online therapy?",4
"I have extremely bad depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. I stopped taking this medication 5 months ago and didn't tell my doctor or family. I wanted to try do it alone. 

My OCD has started destroying my life again. I'm not sleeping at all because I am checking my children and husband are breathing every 4 minutes every night. 

I need to start taking them again as they did help me, I just could not reach orgasm on them. My sex drive did not drop but it was so frustrating. Is this a common thing?

"I unsubscribed from suicide related forums, because overall atmosphere was so self-centered, full of anger and hatred.

Yes I understand, I and they are all frustrated to the level of thinking suicide, it'll be too much to expect civilized response from them or me.

But the extreme selfishness wore me quickly. 'I'm so depressed, I'm going to bitch at you and you're gonna just have to take it.'

Well, I'm starting to think I might not be a terrible scum of Earth as I used to think, because I don't wanna do that to others.
(though I may have done that sometimes without knowing)

It's strange that I can't stand fellow suicidal people, the extreme bitterness and aggressiveness I also have.

Well, there's no such thing as too much love, but there's always too much unhappiness and bitterness in this world.

"My boyfriend of 3 years and I broke up. My first love, my universe, my everything. 
He messaged me on Christmas telling me he still loves me. I told him I loved him too. We met up yesterday for the first time in a couple months. We kissed a bit, my feelings came back more, even though they never really left, and he told me he misses me so much, he looks at pictures of us everyday. That he still wants to marry me one day. Be the father of my children. I say I want this one day too. And that even though I know we're not right for a relationship right now, I love him and we'll still hang out together since he works close to me. He agreed to come back today to see me. He promised. 
I let myself get excited, I waited, I called, he didn't call back. I called him later wondering what was going on, and he says
 ""I'm fucking other girls and they don't need to know I'm talking to you.""
And here I am thinking about us together, waiting for a call, waiting for him to come since I woke up this morning; and that's what he's doing. 
You can think about someone every waking moment and care about them more than anything in the world, and they will shit on you. And crush your soul. And the whole time it could be lies and bullshit, and your feelings could be so real, but the universe is cruel and unforgiving like that. 
The one person I care about more than anybody doesn't give a shit about me. 
He fed me bullshit this whole time. 
And I've been sitting my phone staring at the time waiting for him to call, and his dick is currently in other girls. 
And I don't really know what to do with myself. 
Happy New Years to me. ",4

Nothing is motivating me today, I want to play my games but they get boring quickly, I want to hug my toy but I ended up throwing him halfway across the room when i was trying to get my TV set up to play my movies on my USB, I want to use my paci but I can't find it and there's basically nothing else for me to do.",4

"Good Evening, everyone. I landed a job interview tomorrow. It's my first job interview since I got fired from my old job and checked into a mental institution/rehab February 2017. I've been clean and sober since the 23rd of February, and got on a mixture of different antidepressants (Lexapro, Mirtazapine, Seroquel). I'm anxious as hell and I feel like I'll fuck this up. I really hope not. The starting pay is a little higher than my old job and I actually get benefits with this new opportunity. Hell, even the work hours are great. I just can't shake the feeling I'll fuck up. I really don't want to fuck it up. I feel like my medication has been helping for the most part, but shit. I still can't get the idea that I'm a fucking hopeless drug addict out of my head. That I don't  fucking deserve a second chance at doing something in my life. 


Wish me luck, everyone.",2
"I'm still young, but that's my entire issue. I'm 15, a freshmen at online school, I don't have much friends, and That's kind of the problem, but when I start feeling better I have a birthday, and it makes me feel like the deadline for being an adult is coming closer. 

I am so worried about growing up, I grew up in an extremely poor family with a single mother but the bond I have with my sister (17) and mother is what keeps me going. I don't want these times to end,I am so alone. I don't have anyone but my sister and mother, and when I am 18 I don't know what I'll do. I'm not good at anything, I'm ugly, I have no friends, no social life, I have no plan at all and I'm so scared. I just need someone to talk to. I just want a friend, I'm so lonely.",5
"I'm a positive guy, I make people laugh, and I have a supportive household, to anyone even on here that sounds like heaven. But ever since elementary school its been a same circle of talking to people, making them happy, and then them forgetting about me in the long run to the point of were I cant tell you who I can actually view as a friend or not. Same thing with girls that I seem to fall in âloveâ  with too easily, I end up admitting my feeling to them and then I either get a ânoâ or âidkâ, and its gotten to the point to were loving someone doesn't even se m option anymore. Love from family is definitely a positive thing to have, but as humans we can thrive to have some form of compassion from a stranger, and as we continue to thrive it ends up going from a want, to a need, to something we're just depressed not to have. I guess I'm looking for some form of an answer or resolution before I end up sinking a lot farther than I want into melancholy.",5
"I met my best friend in freshmen year of college. I had been suffering at my worst from my depression prior to that year in high school. Fall semester of freshmen year was the first time in about 5 years that I almost felt ""normal."" That friend was my dorm mate. We were completely randomized but hit it off really well since the beginning. We spent so much time together all of our mutual acquaintances would ask where the other was if absent. Then came spring semester and the depression was back full blown. We both have depression the kind right now where you don't feel anything, and nothing excites you anymore. It started to get noticeably worse for the both of us as school progressed. We're both involved in creative majors and so the anxiety of wether or not to chase a creative path is worth it or not is a main form of anxiety for the both of us. For me it's a bit better because art has been something I've been wanting to do all my life and can't see myself doing anything else. Slowly our relationship just began to deteriorate. We'd go to the same hangouts, do the same things, become bored of it, started becoming more irritable with each other, have less and less to talk about, and eventually have nothing at all to say to each other. It was devastating, meeting up for a hangout and seeing that they obviously didn't want to. They have another friend they're close to but unlike me is someone quite extroverted and humorous with a vibrant personality. I'm more shy and my depressive episodes involve a lot of me just wanting to be left alone. 

They're a bit of the passive aggressive type but I can always see what they're feeling wether they say it or not. We had been close for such a long time and then all of a sudden this other friend had become their #1. I've had trauma in the past where friends have left me in the dust so it doesn't hurt as much as it did during those times but it does sting a little. My attitude towards it is that I just give up. I don't care anymore. I see when they third wheel me and I just don't have the energy to give a shit anymore. I want to slowly fade away. I feel like I've tried my best to rekindle what we had, but it becomes a little tiring when it's all one-sided. It sucks that I feel this way on New Years, so honestly I just want to let it go. I have another really good friend which I'm fortunate to have and I will continue to put effort into the relationships that deserve it. I came to rant about this, but I feel a lot better now getting it off of my chest. I'll be looking into seeing a doctor for the first time ever about my depression and I'm feeling hopeful. Happy New Years everyone.",4
"There's no sugarcoating it really. I have a history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor. I'm 18 now and everything was going great since my birthday (septemeber). I was about to graduate, I had a girlfriend I adored, friends always wanting to do something, and I just generally felt happy. Until early December when my abuser came back into my life ( and I'm too much of a bitch to tell amyone other than my best friend ), one of my friends became toxic and we've slowly distanced, and then my girlfriend dumped me. I was actually dealing with everything well enough but her dumping me was the straw that broke the fragile camel's back. Short anecdote, but my first girlfriend and I broke up in April. I being a vulnerable 17 year old idiot, decided to go on tinder and just find someone, someone who could fill that void. Instead of dating though I just fucked. And not in a good ""I'm having so much sex it feels great!"" kinda way, but more in a last ditch effort for a sense of validity and feeling wanted, followed by complete resentment and disgust in myself afterwards. My current ex helped me not live like this anymore back in June, but then she ended things on the 27th. It was after a long text about all my problems that was induced by a severe overload of anxiety. I don't feel like she's not justified, I just wish I hadn't sent her that. My mind instead of talking it out or anything instead defaulted to my old habits. It's been one week and I've had a one night stand with three different people. I hate it, I never feel macho or confidence boosted after just gross and shameful.

Sex and I have always sorta been like that though. I mentioned my abuser, in short she molested and raped me multiple times through blackmail when I was 15. That's how I lost my virginity. I get that society places too much of an emphasis on it but my first sexual experience was while I was crying, screaming for her to stop, and being berated. I would have preferred better. So after then I just stopped caring about it or myself and just did it whenever I was with someone willing to do such. I always convince myself though, that the person I'm about to have sex with will be someone I want to be with, but that's never the case, yet I keep falling for it. I feel like a sociopath, I keep using other people for a fucked up sense of emotional relief, a way to forget about my ex-girlfriends, to forget about how much I used to care, and to convince myself I've always been this way, I just hided it.

I don't even know if half of this makes sense. I'm not even fully aware of why do it to be honest I think I'm addicted but I'm too terrified to admit that. This is more me just venting about being a manipulative cunt. Rarely do people ever actually read what I post, which usually leads to me deleting them, but if anyone is reading this, can you just tell me if I'm a horrible person for doing this because I can't help but feel as such.",1
"Anybody else?

I'm an aspiring screenwriter and I write my best stuff when I'm in the dark places my depression takes me. I stopped seeing my therapist and stopped taking my medication (sertraline) because I'm scared I'll never get to go to that place again and my writing will suffer because of it. It's ruining my life but it's helping me make a better one for myself. It's the weirdest fucking thing. I guess I could be take my medication like a good little boy, give up on ambition and go work in retail like everybody else I know. But I'm stubborn. I need somebody to talk to.

For those wondering: male, 23, recovered alcoholic (nearly 5 years sober), depression began at 18.",3
anyone else's disassociative streak plunge down the gutter so hard that you've legitimately begun to seperate yourself from your own dilemmas to a point where nothing really fazes you anymore perhaps to shield yourself from the whirlpool of shitty feelings that would otherwise have the power to cripple you and it's leading you down a path of casual detachedness where nothing means anything to you anymore and you have no hopes for the future and you've convinced yourself you'll never be happy and that you're content suffering in your own mind cage from which there is no escape and you no longer put much effort into things because it's all moot anyway and having that dull realisation that if something bad comes you'd just lie down and accept your fate because after years of this unhealthy practiced predisposition you know can't be helped? ,5
"Honestly I'm so tired of living life through failing at everything, I'm not good at anything and I fail to understand why and how people think and learn about everything in such a pragmatic and methodical way. Most people seem to fall within the norm and have socialized support when growing up, I've had none of this (Nor have I been parented properly, I've just been expected to ""Fall into place"") as I have social anxiety and very rarely have had any discussions with people other than online and even they are limited. People seem to hold guidance and know what actions to take to achieve their goals (As if they have some sort of internal compass) I am completely lost as to this? What am I doing WRONG in life? It's also possible that I have a rare genetic disease (Which is being looked into) that causes atypical mental functioning, Is there any hope or should I just fucking end it? I'm so done now. Am I just too stupid to survive in this world? There is so much I am ignorant on regarding ""real world"" practicalities and even other aspects such as politics and history? Even just took some random test ""Am I dumb"" and scored fucking 8/25 even though I'm sure I answered more correctly, I just don't know what to do anymore.",4
I feel really fucking depressed and it just keeps getting worse I literally feel like life is fucking me over every chance it gets. Like any time something bad can happen it will and it's just breaking me down more and more for years now. It's literally starting to feel like any happiness I could ever have will never be enough to help me get over all the fucked up things life has done to me and it literally make me want to stop living. Why should I live when every day it feels like life wants me dead. What should I do?,5
"I am 23 year old guy and for the past while I have felt totally lost and hopeless. I can't remember the last time I was truly happy, and most days I think that I will never be happy again. Hating my life has become a usual thing for me and thoughts of killing myself are very frequently occurring now. Just want to vent a little and see if anyone has any advice at all for me. 

Social anxiety/generalized anxiety has affected my life for as long as I can remember. Self-confidence has always been an issue and has been a barrier in making friends/maintaining the few friendships I do manage to make. I have had periods in my life where I have had a close group of friends to spend time with but I never seem to be able to make lasting friendships. Most of those friends have gone on to make other meaningful relationships in their lives and I was not able to continue being a part of it with them.  On top of this, my family is currently pressuring me to find a girlfriend and get married but since I have not had any relationship with a woman in the past, I have no idea what to do and this is now adding to my anxiety (they tried to introduce me to some girls but I blew all of the chances from lack of experience). I constantly worry about the fact that I am a virgin and no woman is ever going to want me because of it and I also have issues with self-image (hate looking in the mirror sometimes). The loneliness turned me on to porn a long time ago and now I think I have an addiction; I am ashamed of this and feel hopeless because I can never talk to anyone about it out of embarrassment.  
Even for the less embarrassing problems, the 2 members of my immediate family are dealing with a lot of stressful problems of their own and I don't want to continue burdening them with my issues. 

Also, I am currently enrolled in a university program that requires a lot of social interaction when the only thing I feel like doing most days is isolating myself and staying in bed. I feel like the weird guy in my class because I just don't have the energy to socialize and make small talk and even when I do, my anxiety makes it so that I babble on like a fool. It is getting to the point where I am making excuses to explain my absences and I am afraid I am going to fail out of the program or succumb to the immense pressure by doing something irreversible. 

Basically, I hate myself and I just wish I could escape from being me for a while. Getting out of bed is becoming more and more of a chore everyday and I feel sad, ashamed, hopeless, and tired. I am pretty sure I am depressed but with my intense school program I just don't have the time to address my issues. Anyway, if anyone read my rant and has any advice it would be greatly appreciated.

She told me she have never met someone like me and that we got to know each other was ment to for both our sakes. A day ago she told me she dont want anything to do with me.. just my luck.

"I am not much of a people person, more often than not I am forgotten.  People don't gravitate towards me, rather, they tend to stay away.  I try to be sociable, and pleasant, and kind, but it doesn't seem to matter.  People have already made up their minds about me, which is sad, but true.  Some people are just born with it, I guess.  No one wants me in his/her life, there are far better people out there.  People who can sustain a conversation, and be confident and lively.  I am not that person, I used to be, but not anymore.  That part of me is gone, and I don't see it coming back.  I fill my time now with other pursuits, mainly writing and creating videos, neither of which are good.  My writing is terrible and my videos make no sense.  Hell, I tried to make a serious video today, but had to play it off like a comedy because it was downright awful.  I can't even vocalize my feelings properly, nor have anyone truly listen to what I have to say.  There is no point in trying anymore, I feel like giving up.  There is a strange sense of calm to that realization, and it feels more comforting than it should.  I wish it could be different, but sadly, there is no other way.  I suck at everything, except being sad, which ironically enough is what I am trying to rid.  Strange, I know, but right now, it's all I've got.",5

"Well first off 2016 has actually been the worst year of my life, and not because of celebrity deaths (Although Bowie was my idol). To star off the year my special needs aunt who was only one year younger then I (I am 22) died of breathing compilations due to chronic pneumonia. She had the brain functionality of a six month old baby, but we all loved her and we knew it would happen sooner or later.
Then not long after that I had to quit my job, drop everything and use all of my savings to go help my mother because she has a bad heart and it has only been getting worse. At that point in time she was in the hospital and they didn't think she would last the month. She ended up OK and is still around. I really didn't want to go because for my entire life she has been an alcoholic and a drug addict, and how she got her heart condition is an overdose of meth that blew up her heart. Thankfully she has pretty much given up the meth.
I was living with her for about four months all of the while being belittled and degraded by her boyfriend who stole money from me all of the time despite the fact that it was me paying for everything. Her friends weren't much better. Eventually I had enough and I moved back here to to live with my grandparents as they needed help because my grandfather had a stroke and later became for the most part paradise. 
That was the next part of this year that destroyed me. My grandfather due to the strokes and a few other things ended up getting dementia and it got so bad that eventually there was nothing left of him. For most of my life he was the only father figure because my parents were terrible people. He died in his sleep in October. It was also around this time my battle with depression (something I have had a problem with my entire life) started to get much worse and I started to make plans to kill myself.
I only have a few friends and because I was having problems and was distant at times they all started to push me out of their lives until I pretty much begged to be let back in. These are still the people I hang out with, thankfully it has gotten better with them. At the same time my boyfriend (I am bisexual if that matters) dumped me because of my depression. We were planning on moving in together and I was going to propose.
I am writing this because I can't sleep or I don't want to sleep because tomorrow is my eighteen year old and four month pregnant sisters funeral. She was killed Christmas day at six in the morning trying to get to our grandparents house for Christmas. She was hit by a car and was dead on impact. She was the only person I could ever %100 trust with anything, and I am afraid my mother and grandmother are next to go and I don't think it will be much longer because of their health.

Summary: Aunt 21, grandpa 70, pregnant sister 18 died and I am afraid my mother and grandma are next because of health problems. Ex Boyfriend (I'm bi) I was going to propose to dumped me because of my depression. I was used by everyone I thought I could trust, and I tried to kill myself a couple times.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I truly don't know how much more I can handle. I have to be the pillar of strength for my family and I have been for all of this because I hide how much I am hurting. I just wish it would all end and honestly the only reason I haven't been able to kill myself yet is because I am terrified of death. I am 22 6'5 and all I want rite now is someone to hold me so I can finally break down and cry.",4

""Yo, my resolution is to be more direct and meet new people- what'dya say?""

It will be the biggest hail mary I'd have ever pulled. It will either crash so tragically that the fireball would likely engulf the entire planet, or I'd feel liberated and freed from my own inhibitions.

"Um, so I'm 13 and I have depression and anxiety, but I'm only on medication for anxiety until I get my depression medication later.

I can't do school work good anymore, which worry's me. I was one of the best in my class at english work, but now I'm failing because it's getting to difficult to spell and interpret things. I don't know what to do..",3
It feels like 2018 will be a make or break year for me. ,1
"I remember the first time I ever had suicidal thoughts, it was 4 years ago and I was living away from home for university. I remember coming home that weekend and breaking down in front of my parents straight away. That experience was horrifying especially because the thoughts were really severe and that was the start of me being depressed.

Now, 4 years later I have periods of severe depression where these thoughts come up again. However, now whenever I get these thoughts I am able to keep them to myself for an extended period of time and just carry on as normal. A major difference between then and now is that I actually want to die now whereas before that thought was completely alien to me. 

My desire to die is pretty strong right now mainly because I am scared about the new year and the last few months have gone really shit. I love my family so much but I feel like my anxiety and depression is going to win very soon. 

I was thinking of going to my old therapist and showing her my diary with all of my suicidal thoughts with the intention of getting hospitalised but that comes across like attention seeking and that I don't really have a desire to die. Part of me doesn't want to go and show it to her but then another part really does. She is the only one I would show this to. 

I am a coward though and don't really have the fearlessness needed to actually commit suicide which is another negative for me. 

Sorry for the long post!

What do you guys think?

This summer I was very depressed after a break up and existential crisis. I ended up isolating myself in my room by not leaving often and my friend that stayed for the summer happens to be the one that loves belittling me, so they loved to see this. For some reason she is always so competitive and went out of her way to show that she had other friends and made fun of me for being in my room all the time. She was also the friend I was rooming with for the summer. I ended up failing my classes and taking the fall semester off because my depression became so bad. During the fall when I was at home I was fine, but now that im back at school all of the feelings came rushing back. I'm back at school by myself while my old friend group are probably getting together having fun somewhere. They didnt even contact me over the fall so i doubt that they care. I don't want to succumb to my depression again. I want to fit in somewhere this semester and do well. Any advice for this would be greatly appreciated. ",4

"I just realised on New Year's Eve, How much I hated myself.
I'm a slow learner and went into college, very innocent and naive from a strict household. I tried to get laid but couldn't. College is easy for sex but I was struggling. I hate being a virgin. Now that college is done, I regret it and my wasted youth.

I'm slowly losing my sanity and I've had enough of being clueless. I don't know where to start I'm not getting any younger. I went from optimistic to very depressed, self hating, isolated.

Been going through abuse from my parents since 2, been depressed and numb for 20 years and bullying, I never had any friends, I got in an accident and permanently deformed. it got really bad the last 2 years, I had an autoimmune disorder. I don't want therapy, I can't afford it.

I'm in 40k debt with a shit grade. I've never been allowed to have fun or play anything, I can't live my own life. It's all wasted. I'm going to end it soon.

"02:00 AM. January 2.

One year ago. At this moment, I committed suicide. I cut my wrists, arms, veins on joints both vertically and horizontally. Blood bath. Over 80 stitches.

"I don't know whats wrong with me and I don't know what to do. Ive been depressed my whole life, but its only somewhat recently I've realised its not a nornal thing. I've never really woken up happy to be alive. I either have bad days where I wonder why I bother for a while then get up cause it's ""what I gotta do"" and theres other days where I'm able to function ok. I get happy, but ive never been content about life.

Now Ive started getting crazy paranoia. I'm starting to convince myself that my friends who love me hate me and I can't stop it I know it's all not true but there's these sorta voices in my head that do everything they can to convince me it is and I'm starting to give in. I'm just full of hate and soite and jealousy now and i don't wanna feel like that but I cant help it. 

I fucking hate living like this. I'm so fucking alone and my self hatred runs so deep. Ive had periods where ive looked at myself in the mirror and just gotten so fickimg angry that that piece of shit exists and then i get a sorta feeling of clarity where i go to grab the knife or whatevers at hamd and i just whack it on myself. I don't even cut I'm just shout and whack it on my arm and it leaves deep cuts and then i just cry thinming why did i do that.

I don't wanna live like this I don't really wanna live at all I never hsve but i can't die cause I have family. I'm forced to keep going on in this shit. Everyone hates me and I see why. I'm just an insecurities riddled piece of shit and i trust no one not even the people I'm meant to because my head tells me not to. My dads schizophrenic and I'm noticing so many features he has in myself and I'm gonna end up him when I'm older. I'm so fucking alone. No one can save me but shit like loves the only hope i have left. I keep thinking just wait a bit someone will love you but they won't. If anyone tries to I push them away because I'm worried that maybe love won't save me and at that point I'd be conpletely hopeless. Id definitely end stuff then. My arm is so fucked I can never go out without a long sleeve top again. Im only fucking 18 why did I end up like this why cant I be ok",4
"I am a 29 year old man. I haven't had a job in many years, I had to go back to living with my parents, my ex girlfriend of 6 years cheated on me. My social skills are completely gone, I don't trust anyone and I can't talk to anyone anymore let alone a woman.


I am deeply miserable but I don't show it, I just plan in my head for when the time of my death comes. I tried to get a job, any job but no one would hire me. Now I'm stuck with my parents helping with their business making a little money, nowhere near enough for a living.


I feel absolutely useless and I wonder, what is the point? Why keep going? Nothing is getting better for me? I just want to be gone. I don't wanna go on anymore. I probably will never be able to even support myself, I barely have an education, didn't even finish college.

"When I was around 10 my mom was babysitting kids and we went outside to play. When we were playing we ended up using the hose and for some odd reason I told my friend to hold the hose so it wouldn't squirt water and I put my face over it and he let go and i angrily threw a plastic play toy at him ( a light toy ). My mom became instantly angry. She started saying come here in a angry voice and I ran across the yard. Surprisingly she didn't come get me. Long story short I ran in the house went under the couch and hid. My mom rang the phone to my dad and he answered my mom whose was screaming because she couldn't find me. She found me and grabbed me and I kept yelling ""god please help."" And she put her knees on my arm and grabbed a pillow and put it over my face. But then she let go and told me to go down stairs. She told me how much I was a mistake and how she hated me and doesn't love me.

So now I'm here.Nobody texts me,nobody tweets me, and nobody cares about me. I feel like I'm alone.I'll have good days but my mind will still be destroyed by pain.I don't wanna feel this way anymore. I just wanna feel like I'm whole.Oh yeah, and also that friend outcasted me by telling multiple people about my suicidal thoughts and they look at me like I'm different.Despite the fact I have good grades,love to learn,and I'm ambitious, I still feel unhappy and want to have a solid group of friends that love me.I just wanted to share this because i wanna be able to type it out on some platform to maybe help someone and to use this as a way to tell myself that it will get better in college.",4

"I've been depressed most of my life. I know I should have seeked help long ago because, even now, I have never told my doctors that I'm depressed. When I was a young boy, gaming was my passion.

Depression and responsibilities both grew. I got engaged a while back and, as happy as my partner makes me, I still have my personal fits of depression. This may seem cynical, but one person can only do so much for another. I wish I didn't, but I have accepted that painful truth. What really hurts me the most about my state now is that I can no longer truly enjoy playing video games anymore. As I said before, gaming was my passion. Now that I don't have any motivation to play as many games anymore, it makes me feel like I'm throwing my wonderful past with gaming away. I'm really sad.

But now, I may not feel the best, but it's very relieving to finally lose my worries and detach from any pressure I may have had from my friends and family.

"I finally got the time to post this, I've been opening the submit page for a while but I couldn't just do it. I need to get this off my chest.

It's been a real hell for me since 2 years when my mother died and I am forced to live and get tortured by my stepfather but since December, I feel like I've been going through much worse things now. 

I'm already suffering enough from horrible family abuse, death of my mother, finding out the hard and sad truth who were my real parents, social anxiety and losing nearly all of my friends, but I've been now also suffering quite alot at college.

I'm getting nearly constantly bullied by my groupmates since the first week of college. I've been called names, humiliated infront of others, including teachers, even physically hit couple of times. I've tried to ignore them and report them to our teacher, but that did do nothing, only if anything, my teacher also made fun of me and believed their rumour about me infront of the group. Other groupmates won't do anything about it either because they all know each other. Some of the bullies are even bullying me together so I can't do so much about it, they also keep bullying teachers too and have the worst grades ever.

I almost literally have no friends in college, except few guys and they betrayed me too. It's so hard for me to have great grades when you're basically alone all the time without any help at all.

In the last day when we were on practice, they refused to work with me and they shamed me the whole day, I didn't get to do anything at practice at all because of them, that made me so hopeless in myself and I don't feel motivated to improve practing after this at all. 

It's really hard for me to live with my stepfather who often emotineally abuses me alot and tried to kick me out of home once, with a family that tried to commit me into mental hospital in a sick way, without friends and being constantly bullied in college. I feel like giving up anytime soon and accept my fate if nothing changes.

The only game that makes me feel better for awhile is Life is Strange. It has alot of situations which hit me home and I would relate to them so hard, making me feel better feeling that I'm not alone. Also the game mainly is about friendship, Max, Chloe and Rachel are really great friends and I've had these kind of friends before I lost them unfortunately. Actually felt I wasn't alone while playing this masterpiece game.

I wish one day I wouldn't wake up to stop suffering like this forever everyday.

"For the first time in years, I feel like I have no control over myself. My coping skills arnt working as they used to. My emotional support animals are becoming emotionally drained from being there for me so much. My boyfriend is stressed from working the holidays, so going to him will only add more stress. Ive only met my new therapist a few times, so I dont yet feel comfortable telling her everything detail for detail yet. I dont know how I will be able to make it through the year, sanely. I often feel that the only reason I can live to see tomorrow is because of my boyfriend, my small dieing family, and my three bunnies. If they all leave this year, I don't think I will make it. What is my next step? What do I do?

tldr; Depression is kicking full blast for the first time in years.

"I have Asperger's Syndrome...it makes understanding social cues, empathizing with others (IE understanding why you made someone upset), and social interaction in general very difficult. When compounded with existing depression, it makes me feel profoundly isolated sometimes.

Things have been looking up somewhat recently - I graduated college and am currently looking for a full-time job - but the fact that I will always struggle with this disorder and find it difficult to interact with others makes me profoundly sad. A relationship seems impossible, as does sex. I don't mind living by myself and have tried to come to peace with it, but being a round peg in a world of square holes does get to you sometimes.

"19 male America. I am in a worse place than ever before and not entirely sure of who or where I am so please excuse any nonsensical bits or typos. To put it simply enough, every thought, person, and location feels bizarre and unreal and detached and profoundly difficult and overwhelming. I feel like an alien life form who has been suddenly thrown into a human life and body, even though I've had 19 years of this existence. Or maybe I feel like nothing at all in an empty vessel others take for a human. Maybe that's a better way of putting it. I have been severely depressed and anxious as long as I can remember (I tried to throw myself in front of a car when I was 7), but this feeling is new. Am I dissociating? This morning (5 PM actually, morning for me) my dad, who I really like and respect and who has been as supportive as possible for me, came to wake me and I literally forgot for a moment who he was, who I was, and where I was. Although I had been invited to a party, I had spent New Year's Eve the night before alone, crying and thinking about death and viscerally shocking myself every moment, realizing I still existed. To get back to the point of this rant, the most basic things like material objects and gravity and other people feel apart from me and almost sinister. I dropped out of high school, got a GED, and failed or stopped attending two community college classes, all the while sporadically working three different jobs all of which I was fired from or quit after about two months. I've been talking to a few girls who seem very interested in me, but whenever it comes time to seal the deal or set a date, I just... don't. I don't know why. I'm just so tired of it all and I can't begin to imagine decades more of this life without having a panic attack. Last night I began writing my suicide note even without any particular plan in mind, but it felt cathartic, realer than anything I've experienced in years. I think I'd use sleeping pills. Other than that, music, which I listen to all the time, is my only anchor. Usually I only begin to feel alive when contemplating my death. At least I have control over that, and my memory would be viewed with rose tinted glasses, better than anything I could ever actually be. This post will probably be paid no attention because that's just how life goes for me, and that's not bait for attention. Whatever. At least I could put my thoughts down.",2

It's been rough but I at least owe myself this one thing. 
Sorry if this sounds like a pity party for myself but I just wanted to try and have someone that I need to report to. That seems to be the only way that I can get anything that I want to do done is if there is pressure on me. It's the only reason I applied for my last job.

"It's almost 2018 and I have realized that this entire year will be added to the others that I have spent in a hellhole. I made a Reddit to rant to anonymous strangers on the internet and am feeling pathetic for it as no one would take me seriously if I said any of this in real life. I am fortunate and appreciate all that's been given to me in my life. However, I lacked a loving mother and father growing up and have always been subjected to, dare I call it, severe verbal discipline. Several hours of harsh yelling would be the result of accidentally forgetting to rinse out the mop as a third grader. There is only so many times someone can call you a stupid piece of shit before you believe it yourself. I became a nervous child, and never spoke until spoken to. I would be terrified to play outside of the privacy of a locked room. Despite this, I no longer hold blame to my parents. That is all that they were taught, although nothing can make it right. To this day, I panic when someone of authority even raises their voice slightly. But I believe that forgiveness may as well be the first step to forgiving myself. I am still young, 17, and I would like to say: DEPRESSION IS VERY REAL. It leaves you neglecting everyone around you and your personal hygiene. It saps away your ability to live. I thought I was just âgrowing upâ and that I would grow out of the âmoodsâ. But here I am, five years later, with the only thing stopping me from suicide being the thought of accidentally turning myself into a vegetable. I had suffered from a self harm addiction for the last year and I think I've kicked it for good. No one knew. Three rounds of antidepressants and attempts at therapy; yet, the fog still lingers.

I pushed people away,  not because I wanted to be alone, but because it was less exhausting than going out and doing stuff. I waited way to long to go back to my therapist and it just continued to snowball to the point that I felt there was no way out of it.
   I've recently taken a big step towards improving my well being and I am hoping that this will make 2017 a little more bearable. This step,  being medication,  has been something I've been reluctant to take as I felt like a failure. In hindsight, it's really no different than taking a medication for any other illness and in order to get better I think this is something I have to do. 

Cheers to a better 2017 for anyone fighting an illness. ",5

"I'm glad to have found this page for broken souls. Like most of you, I have no one to talk to either. I certainly have no friends and haven't for a very long time, but I do have a family that loves me and even a wife. But I can't talk to them. See, my family doesn't understand the depths of my depression and I certainly can't explain it. Words fall short, tears choke out the ones I do try. No one knows me. My wife does, better than anyone else, but no one really knows. She's asleep on the couch right now cause we had another fight. 

My depression has been extremely severe for the last year, and the past couple months it has really been spiraling beyond my control. My anger and irritability are off the charts. I can't eat, but I'm starving. I'm so tired, but I can't sleep. I feel like every moment of my life is just spent suffering, waiting and wondering when it will all finally end. I just keep praying I'll die in an accident so I can be at peace without having to feel guilty for hurting the people who love me. I never leave my house anymore, I can't go into grocery stores or gas stations because I can't bare to interact with people. I can't work because the depression is so debilitating. Ive started having panic attacks and extreme social anxiety. I feel like no one likes me and I don't blame them. I hate myself, I hate having this severe depression, I hate what it does to me and the people I care for, I hate that it makes me useless. I would give anything to just be normal. I want to function like a normal person who can shower and go get groceries and talk to people and feel ok and work and contribute something. 

Everyday I wake up, I sit in my house all alone all day long staring at the walls and trapped in my own head, then I try to sleep again. I don't want to even move. It's gotten so bad and I'm so afraid of finally killing myself that I went to the doctor a few weeks ago even though I have no money, job or insurance. They did an MRI of my brain with and without contrast on the 28th and I am waiting for the results. I feel that I must have a brain tumor or something. I'm scared of how I feel and I am losing more control everyday. 

I'm almost 28 years old, I have 2 college degrees, a loving wife, a house, food, family...I had a good life for the most part, I mean it could have been a lot worse and honestly, situationally my life is better than it's ever been before. That's why I don't understand why my depression has gotten so bad right now. I've been depressed officially since I was 17 but the first time I tried to kill myself I was in the third grade. I don't want to kill myself anymore, although I fantasize about dying constantly. I'm not selfish enough. That's why I really want some help, I've lost control several times recently and all it takes is a few seconds to end your whole life. I don't want to do that. But no one understands where I am at right now, not even my wife and we have been pushing each other away for months.

I recently tried to battle my loneliness and for several months I tried making new friends and reaching out to old ones that I had lost. I kept it up daily even though it was exhausting for me. I never even once got the slightest indication any one of them cared or wanted to be friends or even liked me at all. It sucked and it hurt and it made me retreat farther. I used to be popular in high school and have tons of friends, I dont know what is so unlike able about me now. I guess I am awkward and don't have much in common with most people.


So.....what am I supposed to do? I just want to be better. 

My next step I think is going to be writing to this sub Reddit regularly. I need some place to get my thoughts out and to say how I feel, even if no one is really listening. God knows I've fucking tried everything else.",5

Despite having a job, a car, a girlfriend, a place with people that i know that love me that i can call home, i still feel like complete shit and knowing these things and not understanding why i feel like this makes me feel even worse.

"As the title suggests I could really use some advice. I've been struggling with depression for years, with this latest episode affecting me since mid-November. It is now January 2018 and although I've had some good times and didn't really feel depressed over the Holidays, it all just came flooding back last night.

All of my friends ended up bailing on me on New Years so I spent the night alone in my room until I fell asleep around 9 pm. I woke up around 3 in the morning and stupidly checked my phone. When I did I saw all the friends that bailed on me at different parties, surrounded by others, having fun. This sent me spiraling back into depression and I found myself close to ending my life with a belt which I've read can be very painless. I was able to take some medication that helped me go to sleep again and get through the night.

It's now 1:30 in the afternoon and I still feel the same way with absolutely nobody to talk to about this because I don't want to be that person that brings somebody down on New Years.

It just feels as if no matter what medications I take, whatever therapist I have, and even with these group therapy sessions I've been attending, I always end up back on the train to death. It's starting to feel like the only solution as I've tried making some major changes in my life and none of them have made any impact when others have told me they would.

Thank you for reading and any advice would be greatly appreciated.

"About a year ago I met a girl, while I was doing fine.

I said her multiple times that if I'm a burden she should just forget and not talk to me like everyone else... though she denies it, I believe I am.

"I suffer from some serious intermittent depression. It's never gotten so bad to the point I seriously thought about suicide, but it gets to a point where I am a completely different person. I get angry or sad for little to no reason, I don't talk as much, and I find myself with little to no motivation. 

I've kind of suffered a perfect storm for it though, admittedly. I lost both of my parents before I was old enough to drink, I was made fun of and picked on in middle school, was a pothead loser in high school, and now here I am a 24 year old man with no friends and a girlfriend I'm not exactly satisfied with. 

I get depressed every now and then; one could say that is quite normal and everyone does. But one thing that I don't think is normal is that I've never, ever been truly happy. I know that there are people that wake up in the morning and can't help but smile because their life is awesome and they feel incredibly happy. With most people it's because of a certain thing that they have that keeps their spirits high. Perhaps it's a wonderful significant other that makes them feel like they won the lottery. Perhaps they are blessed with astonishingly good looks or intelligence. With many, it could just be that you have good family and friends to pick you up. 

I have virtually none of these things. I have no reason to be happy. And I never have been. I can't recall in recent memory ever being in an uplifting mood one could deem happy. In fact, I'm aware and those close to me are aware of the fact that I am almost completely emotionally numb. I don't feel happy or sad or mad 90 percent of the time. Terrible things will happen, such as a family member passing away, and I won't feel any remorse. 

I know that this is likely just another one of those intermittent batches of depression, but I can't help but feel that this is the truth. I'm a pathetic, broken man that doesn't really have a reason to wake up happy. 

I'm not sure what I'm trying to get out of this post. Maybe to see if others have felt the same? Does anyone else feel emotionally numb? Does anyone else find looking at others happiness depressing? Does anyone else feel that they've never been happy? Because at times it feels like I'm the only one on Earth that does. ",4

"I tried to kill myself last night. Didn't go through with it.

I was thinking about making suicide my new years resolution.

But no.

This is going to be the year all this turns around.

My new years resolution: Develop healthy coping mechanisms. Use them. Be a better person. Stop sh'ing. Help people. Keep my mind on the positives, the negatives can fuck right off. When the going gets rough, we'll keep marching on, no matter how bleak the future seems.

There's so much life ahead of me. Sometimes it seems like i won't make it past even age 18. But now there's a brand new year. I'm going to make the most i can of being alive.

I dont know if this helps anyone. It probably reads like complete bullshit, i'm sorry. I wouldn't have believed any of it for a second last week--ive had a really, really rough christmas break. But this is my vow to myself. Im going to make it through the year, and hopefully be better off for it.

"So, I'm medicated but not in therapy, and this is more a collection of thoughts than a coherent chain, but it's something I've been thinking about often of late.  Anyway, here we go.

I want to be neurotypical.  It sucks there's no cure for depression, you know?  And that NT people have no fucking frame of reference talking about depression, like I have no frame of reference talking to someone with bipolar, which brings me to my next point.

&amp;nbsp;

Depression isn't ""really sad,"" you can't even fucking be sad when you're depressed.  You can't enjoy the things you used to enjoy.  For me, depression has always been this suffocating apathy, and ""feeling"" isn't an option.  I'm not crying because I'm sad, I'm crying because I'm feeling nothing, and it feels pointless.

I want to be a whole person.  I'm not motivated.  There's nothing I really want from life.

it just feels like no matter how much i breath, i can't get enough air. and it also feels like my heart beat is extra loud? if that makes sense. also, it's vey uncontrollable. there was no immediate stresser, but i have been stressed about life in general lately. like what i'm going to do in the future, a job, etc.

i also get this feeling when laying in certain positions, being too hot, and feeling too constricted. none of these took place tonight, though. is this a panic or anxiety attack? does anyone else get this??

Some backstory:
I'm currently attending college.
I have a body focused repetitive disorder that popped up around early high school and has since been a lot better. I've always been a bit on the depressed side since middle school with low self esteem. 



One reccuring thing is in certain situations I become very stressed (?) to the point where my mind just digs itself into a hole of despair and I have episodes of just crying and feeling extremely awful. Most recently, I've been triggered by my boyfriend.


At first it was just arguments over random things we disagreed on and slowly the crying episodes came on. Eventually I think it's just instances of him being mad at things I don't do on purpose but are sometimes wrong and me feeling so bad about myself that I get into that mind space and can't get out. He thinks of them as tantrums and doesn't know how to deal with or help with them. 


Even at home, when I think too much I focus on all the bad and this happens again. I start doubting my relationship because of all the bad stuff, I start feeling bad about my life etc.



For the most part I really like my relationship. Outside of the arguments we fit together really well. He's very sweet and caring. 


Does anyone know what I might be experiencing and how to fix it?

"So I've always been a reserved introverted person by nature and this had not been a problem even when I got to College. I would wake up, go to class, say a few hellos here and there and then go back to my dorm. Little did I know of people and how they actually worked and little did I even know of myself. Anyway fast forward a few times into the future, I met some people who I guess for the first time in my life, I wanted to be friends with. Now, I'm a guy who readily smiles and is polite etc and I guess something deep down inside of me really wanted to impress these folks (especially since I had no friends at the time). This I now know is a result of low self esteem but I'll come back to that. So we all decided to room together the following year and I admittedly was excited, seeing as I had only stayed by myself or with strangers before. This is where my self esteem comes into play. We signed up for apartments (3 bedrooms). The first room which was the largest was actually picked and moved in, it remained the two other rooms. 

Now these two rooms were built differently, one of which had the bathroom inside (B room) and the other had the bathroom on the outside and was smaller a bit (C room). I made a costly mistake when I actually picked the B room and signed the lease to pay for it, only for me to offer it/exchange it (while still paying for it!). Knowing who I am, I thought this was gesture of friendship or something but looking back now, this was an incredibly stupid and naive decision. 

As the semester wore on, I went from regret to sadness to depressed and just could not live with myself nor could I let go of that mistake. I began to question everything, what made me come to that decision? How could I have been so naive? No one does that. Realizing that it was low self esteem even made it worse. I began making bad decisions after bad decisions. I found myself saying yes to things I didn't want to do, I was suffering inside. I withdrew into myself and went from reserved to just plain silent when in groups especially with these people because I could sense how stupid they thought I was. This wore on me so heavily that it affected my academics and my overall view on life and people. I've hated myself a bit because everyday I pass that room or get the bill, it just reinforces these beliefs. 

It may sound dramatic but its true. The lease will be up in 4 months or so and I can't wait to leave. I have also learned a lot from staying with these folks and from this entire experience even though its been a nightmare. I'm having a hard time finding myself again and although its a new year, I'll be going back to school soon and will soon meet them again. I have tried over the break to strengthen myself again and not go down the same route of trying to commit to things I don't want to do etc this time but I'm not sure. 

How would you have done it?

"Is there anyone else here that has so much but doesn't feel like they really deserve any of it?

Personally I've got a few really close friends from home and college, a great GPA, a good job, a family that probably isn't as bad as I think it is, and we're getting by financially, even if it is a bit tough.

I think about my situation compared to some of the others I read on here and I question why I'm so depressed. Even with all that I have, I feel like I don't deserve what I have, and someone who can actually enjoy them should have them instead. Thinking that I'm the one who gets it instead just makes me feel worse about it really

"Mindless Self Indulgence - It Gets Worst comes to mind immediately.
This song is pretty much my theme song.

I also enjoy Black and Death Metal a lot.
Behemoth, Shade Empire, Dimmu Borgir, Hate. Great bands.

Since I am usually not happy, I rather sit and listen to music that is about death, destruction, hatred, pain, misanthorpy, war, and satanism. All the dark shit.
I sound like some dumb edgy kid, but music like this gives me peace.
It fits in with usually how I feel.
If I try to be social, I just push people away. Making new friends or find a girlfriend is pointless.
Silence is beautiful. My shitty voice will ruin whatever conversation is taking place.  I should have my vocal cords removed.

I thought I would be happier because I got a better job, but being lonely really sucks a lot more than I thought it would.

"This is on wikipedia, the page title is ""Social psychology"".

&gt;  The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.[18]:109 Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.[18]:111 Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).[20]

Lol, sorry, i should have explained what this shit means.

Realistic perception means you can understand both personal deffects and also situation ones, it just means you don't excuse yourself for your mistakes or wrong doings, but you also will not excuse anyone. You have higher moral standards. You see things for what they are. 

Happy people will fuck up today, rationalize their bullshit away in one sentence and completely forget about it. They say it's strenght but in reality is just ignoring.

"i just really need to get this out, i feel so much guilt and shame.

a friend of mine that i was once really close with (and shared romantic feelings and moments with over the years) killed himself two nights ago.

we had a stupid fight late 2015 and it wasn't until mid 2016 we finally apologised to each other and made amends. he had bipolar, he was always very open about it. i struggle with depression and anxiety. when we started talking again, i had not long broken up with a partner and was taking it really hard and trying to cope by abusing drugs and alcohol - i was not in a good place. he was very manic, immediately leaning very heavily on me and wanted to see me. he was also recently heartbroken.

i felt pressure and after our time apart was, in all honesty, thrown off by his intensity and made excuses not to see him. 

we caught up a couple of months later and again, he was very manic. but he was the same person i knew and loved and i was happy to be with him again. however that night we were drinking and popping pills, and we were heavily flirting. after a tender moment he kissed me and he wanted to start things up with me, to 'give us a shot'. telling me how beautiful i was and that we always had a connection etc. i got awkward and avoided him for a while after that. he made attempts to hang out with me and i avoided and made vague excuses.

the next couple of months i culled my social media (i was really weird and anxious about my privacy) and deleted anyone who wasn't in my immediate circle at that time, which included my friend. when he realised, he was hurt and we fought. 

he told me how much he had been struggling, dealing with suicide hotlines... i stood my ground, told him he was too intense... looking out for number one, i forgot to listen and care about my friend who just wanted support and someone to be by his side.

we made plans to hang out at a friends house around 7 months ago. he was, again, manic and abusing his prescription drugs. i was concerned, but mostly irritated at his intensity. we however left with a hug and on good terms.

7 months later he killed himself.

this post is all over the place and doesn't do our relationship justice, i am focusing on the fights we had and the ways i let him down because they are all i can think about. i feel so horrible and guilty. struggling with my own depression, i should have been there for him.

i don't know what the point of posting this is, i'm sorry for the waffle. i just needed to do something with this guilt",4

"Why do you think you don't deserve to be happy?

Is it because you think you are a bad person or that you made a bad decision?  Is it because you think you have nothing to offer to the world?  What if I told you that you don't have to be a bad person.  Forgive yourself for making a bad decision and promise yourself you won't do it again, what good is it to continue to beat yourself up about it?  It is not making you a better person, you are not becoming happier.  You may think you have nothing to offer; but I bet when you convince yourself you do, you will have something to offer.  If you think you don't deserve to be happy, you are wrong.

Being happy isn't just going to come to you.  You aren't going to wake up feeling like you are on top of the world.  You have to make it happen.  You have to decide to get up and be the best you can.  It takes practice to be happy, you have to work at it.  

Depression, atleast from my point of view, has been highly self inflicted.   I chose to stop eating, I chose to stop trying, I chose to stop caring, I chose to stop talking to those around me, and I chose to stop doing the things I once loved to do.  

I and you need to choose to to be happy.  You need to choose to get healthy.  You need to choose to get out of bed. You need to choose to start caring.  You need to choose to love those around you.

Someone loves you, if you don't think that then I believe someone will love you if you put yourself in the position for them to love you.  

You deserve to be happy.  You REALLY deserve to be happy.  Try to be happy, no matter how hard it may seem.  Being happy is the point of life.",0

It's been a rollercoaster of emotions since then, and all I could do to keep me sane was studying and working. I didn't pursue any personal hobbies, apart from some sporadic gaming. I've been literally preparing exams and working almost non-stop and most of the time I went to bed very late. My soul has been sucked out; If I didn't have to work anymore and I finished studying, I wouldn't know what to do apart from staying on the computer.

"EDIT: Wow that many upvotes and support, thank you to everyone who has commented here, it has helped me, happy new year

I have been born in a terrible part of a bad country in south east Europe, I suffer from depression, social anxiety, severe OCD, (I can't get help for any of my mental illnesses) I suffer waking up, and suffer even more when going to sleep, I am slightly overweight, get bad grades at school, am socially awkward as hell, get bullied, feel poor, my family has been damaged by the communist system, I feel guilty and worthless, I have a toothache and will probably have to go to the dentist about it, doing that in the part of the world where I live in is what I genuinely think is brutal torture, have anger issues, been feeling numb lately, I can't help but mindlessly envy people who have honestly had it way easier than me in life as they revel in their lives, cake walking through their days as I suffer... and I get that the image that they have painted of themselves through social media is not accurate, the internet has lowered my self esteem by making me feel left behind and inadequate because it made me feel like I am here suffering, feeling guilty and worthless while others are having a blast in their perfect lives, (one of the most memorable things that made me compare myself to someone was a tweet by jesse cox saying things along the lines of how he gets to do all these cool things because he is a popular youtuber and how he is having an amazing time of the year, ""having the biggest joys of his life"") I have piles of homework that I have trouble starting because I know it will be painful, I feel inferior to everyone else in my class and I have no idea how they push themselves to do the painful ass work required to get good grades, I am jealous of others in my class, I can't bring myself to workout, I stutter, I feel lazy and unproductive but can't have that pain bring me to do work, I think I am causing my parents depression, my voice sounds like absolute garbage, and cringey + high pitched when I speak in English, I keep feeling tired...

"Been with my boyfriend for a year now, and after getting out of an abusive relationship with my ex of 4 years. 

A lot happened to me, and I'm still trying to cope. Since then, I've been switching medications, weaning off, increasing, etc. My moods are all over the place, and recently I've been crying over everything. 

My boyfriend thinks I'm overreacting and I should move on from the sexual and emotional abuse I experienced for years. He has never understood what it's like to battle depression, and I can't find a way to show him it's more than being ""sad"" over ""stupid"" things that happened in the past. 

Recently, I've been diagnosed with tuberculosis, had to quit my job due to hostile work conditions, can't go back to the medical field now because of the TB, out of money and relying on my parents, I have no friends, can't make friends because everyone around here is an asshole, struggling with weight problems for the first time in my life, still trying to wrap my head around the fact I was raped, and a lot of other issues that just keep piling up. 

I don't know what to do. He doesn't take me seriously, which leads to arguments, which then leads to me crying, and he can't deal with crying. He says I cry too much, I need to stop letting everything bother me. Duh, I'm trying?

"My life is a complete fucking mess. I don't know if this is depression, some undiagnosed mental thing, or just me being under the illusion I'm somehow special and need help even though my life is normal

I guess I've always felt some depression. I never really fitted in. I was always the most unpopular guy in school by a long margin and just kept myself under the illusion that I didn't give a fuck, I could sort my life out later and not worry about it. I have never had very many friends, if at all, in real life; and found myself turning online for people to talk to. I'm too fucking anxious to talk to people in real life. Over the past year or so I began speaking with a guy, my age, with similar problems to what I have now I suppose. We grew closer and closer, he told me he was transgender and wanted to become a girl. Cool, I'm totally ok with that, hey maybe I can support him during transition in the UK - he was in the US. Of course, it was kinda inevitable that since we were already so close we fell in love. I was 100% sure I was straight but it's the first time someone had ever shown love to me and I loved him so much, and we were determined to make it work. Over time we planned out our lives, I guess an escape from reality, and I felt I'd met my life partner. Over time though, I began feeling more and more shit. Some days I felt so damn in love nothing even mattered I was so happy and upbeat, some days I hated myself, didn't want to wake up, feeling empty. We broke up yesterday which, I'm not gonna lie, has contributed to this, but even before that, before then I felt bad, I was just trying to gloss over it. The breakup was on good terms and immediately after I felt relieved in a way. Now though everything is haunting me - thinking of anything we did together, listening to any music they suggested or even that I played while we were messaging causes me to literally burst into tears. I can't speak to them about anything without having an emotional breakdown. It's made me realize how alone I was, a reality check. It's made stuff worse but definitely hasn't caused it.

Right now I have one person I'd truly consider a friend in real life, and complete anxiety to speak to anyone else. I feel so damn lonely, this Christmas has been awful. I don't have many interests which makes it difficult, computing is probably my main and when anyone asks about that I honestly can't tell if they're being serious or just sarcastic. I used to trade stuff to make extra money but that became an obsession, buying and selling for even the tiniest profit, and now it all just seems pointless. I'm reckless with money, deep into savings parents lent me trying to ""start a business"" - ""I can easily repay them"". Nope, I'm thousands in debt already to a fucking emergency fund and I hate myself for being so naive into doing that. I've kinda lost my interest in everything now, everything seems pointless, and I'm just left browsing reddit pointlessly or watching youtube all day listening to the same repetitive music.

Even before then I had thoughts that I want to sleep and never ever wake up. That I hate living. Nothing truly suicidal - I could never face death, but mentally in a way - giving up, that everything was pointless. Sleeping is my only way to escape from the shitty thoughts I have, from anxiety in anything social.

Throughout the relationship I had what I called ""negative thoughts"" - what if I didn't love her, what if... etc. I put pieces together with something that has been going on throughout my life that I'm guessing is very mild ocd - pathetic things like triple checking the gas burners are off before bed, having to step on the same paving slab, type evenly on a keyboard - it's all very irrational and does not make sense but if I don't do it my mind says ""if you don't do it then so-and-so won't happen"". During the relationship this got bad as the thing I wanted most - the relationship - began to be the go-to for everything and I was literally double or triple checking everything, my mind insisting I did everything evenly. It's not happening as much now because there's nothing I want, inserting death into that situation has no effect.

These have also been complimented with always worrying about stuff, something I've had for a long time. Irrational fears. I can't tell which thoughts I have are real and which aren't. I've been worrying I'm gay, or I'm transgender, or I'm asexual, completely irrational since I've identified as straight cisgender all my life, and the thoughts will not fucking go away. I have so much anxiety speaking to girls it's making those arguments worse, and of course the relationship is like, even though I fell in love with her viewing her as a girl which she really is if he's transgender, ""you fell in love with her as a guy and of course that makes you gay"". I'm struggling to hold a conversation with friends for fear of going on or being judged, I can't even start a conversation with any girl about work or whatever.

Everything in life just seems pointless like there's no end, no point in working, no point in anything. I haven't done a single piece of homework, always excusing my way out of it. I can't concentrate for more than ten minutes. I have GCSE mocks in two days and I haven't revised at all - I just find myself getting distracted - then I cut internet and just fall into depression and crying uncontrollably. I'm gonna fail them, everyone is telling me I should be aiming for A*s but I'll be lucky to fucking pass them like this. We were meant to revise over Christmas and I've spent the majority of my time crying about self-pity, worries, loneliness in real life, regret, anxiousness, and lack of motivation; and then staying up until 4am to try make the mess that was a long-distance relationship work, not getting up until 2pm. It was fucking stupid, it's my fault, but I just keep putting shit off and once I do try to focus I give up. There's no fucking point.

I look awful, acne is covering my skin, I only started giving a proper fuck about personal hygiene properly as the relationship started so my acne is probably some of the worst ever, I can't see it ever going. (The only other treatment left that might work is this shit that has possible side effects like ""suicidal thoughts and depression"" and I worry shit like that is gonna push me over the edge). I'm stupidly tall, over 2m yet under 16yo, my body is a mess, I'm ugly as fuck and I can't ever see someone being attracted to me, ever. I'm awful at sport, I swim but have lost the motivation to because nothing seems to fucking matter anymore.

I don't even know why I made this post. It's a mess. I'm really hoping it's just getting over a relationship but seeing as this happened before it ended and in the past before I even spoke to this person I don't know. I just hate the fucking thoughts in my head telling me to do things, or irrational thoughts that I'm struggling to judge if they're even irrational anymore. I can't tell what's real and what's fucking with me. I can't concentrate on work, I can't hold a fucking conversation, there's nothing I'm good at, I'm the most unpopular guy ever and I'm worrying I'll never be able to get over this fucking mess I called a relationship let alone even initiate another one. Everything is pointless. My mood is constantly swinging between crying uncontrollably about everything, chucking everything on the floor, kicking shit with anger and self-hate, and then happiness and hope, rarely though. I started writing this post feeling awful, now I feel very slightly better, but I know I'm gonna feel worse in a bit.

I don't know. My life shouldn't be fucked up. This is probably just me being stupid and overhyping things like I always tend to do and I'm really fine but in the darkest times I know it's more than that. In the darkest times, every couple of days, I just want my life to end. Is it depression? I'm really not sure - I can't be sure on fucking anything it seems.

(Literally the only chat I have with another person is my one true friend (Who doesn't respond to any of my messages even though he talks in groups) the rest I haven't had a chat since beginning of december) I keep telling myself that its okey. That I don't need them. I am probably right, But it feels really shitty. And to top it all of, my depression is coming back. I can feel it creeping up.


Thanks for reading all this, You are probably the first people to care for me since vacations started.


tl;dr friends ditched me, depression is coming back. ",4
"So, there's this podcaster/YouTuber I stumbled upon, and in one of his recent videos, the topic of suicide comes up. In the video, he speaks about all the suicidal messages he recieves from people 
all around the world who listen/watch him. As he goes on, it gets harder for him to talk about it, and it reaches the point where he breaks down, where just describing the messages puts him in tears, as you can tell how much he cares for these people and how much he can empathise with them.

But, I just don't understand it. As much as I try to get it, I can't. Why do people weep for us? Why do they care so much? Why do they spend so much time and resources helping us get better? And with 7.6 billion other happy souls out there, why should one or two lives even matter? 

TLDR: I just don't understand why people would help and care for others so much, even when there's nothing in it for them? ",4
"As title says. Any experiences? I am lost and finally succumbed to going to my doctor and he appointed me these meds, I have just started taking them. Do they work for you? Side effects? How has it affected your life?

I sometimes struggle to even get out of bed, and I overthink and get anxious about the smallest things. It is making it so damn hard to cope and I hardly ever feel like a normal person. 

Join this up with a family that wants me to get a really good education, and me hardly being able to get through it makes it rough, the whole society just expects you to perform so much. 

I feel like I am about to hit a wall, but I hope I can finish my education before I crash and burn. 

Sorry for the rant.",3
"I feel really conflicted right now. Am i just weak? I don't have anything to really complain about right now, so why do i feel this shitty?

"A friend I've met in Discord is having problems with not only his ADHD, Depression and Anxiety but with his manipulative uncle.
He's living with his uncle but he can't really do anything, he yells at him, disconnects him from the internet for weeks for laughing and is one of the reasons he's depressed.
I want to know what would be the best way to help him? He has already tried contacting the police but the situation seems to become worse by the week. I don't live near him (and by that i mean within a 500km radius) so I can't help him directly ",4
"As the title states I think my wife is depressed. She won't admit that she is though, nor will she see anyone about it. 

We used to see a counciler together, but stopped because she claimed it was making things worse.

The whole story:
In March of 2015 we had to move for me to start my career, she was pregnant and the baby was due in a week. Before this we lived an hour from her parents for college and she went to her parents every weekend to visit, even if i had to stay to work. My wife was going to stay with her mom since they lived closer to the Dr we had been going to.

I started the job and my son was born the next day after my wife got rushed the the ER. Very eventful, but great day. Wife turned out okay and have a healthy son. After a week we got to go to or apartment, which is around a 2 hour drive from her parents.

Fast forward a few months, she started missing family, we've also been driving up to stay at her moms place at least every other weekend. Then in November after a few weeks in the hospital her grandmother dies. This drives her over the edge the first time. She talks about how much she needs to live in the country and not the city. How much she can't stand where we live and is crying most days.

We then look for a house in a rural area, I never planned on staying in the apartment anyway, but we were already in debt from moving down here, now we are moving again, luckily we managed to avoid a down payment and closing costs. We have nothing in savings, as we are constantly going somewhere, she thinks we need to go on a date, and she's to tired during the day to do anything so all we do together is clean when I get home from work. We are now living in the only house we can afford in a rural area. 

For a bit she is okay. Still need to go out, still visiting family(which is really just spending the weekend at her mom's house and she sleeps in, we don't actually go visit the rest of the family that she complains she misses and says that we don't see enough). 

About 6 months in she starts again. She's homesick. I don't know what to do. For a bit I was setting a psychiatrist and was getting help for my depression, but I just don't see the point anymore. The one I was seeing no longer works for the place I was going to so they canceled my appointment and I never rescheduled. 

We agreed to try and move to the half way point of here and her parents, but I don't think it's going to change anything, except put us in more dept and all she says is she doesn't care about the money. Only way I could think of to attempt to move was fix the crap wrong with the house we are living in and attempt to bring the value up. We still owe more than its worth and she just wants to sell it and buy a new place. We have a son who is about to be 2 and nothing in savings. 

Her mom does not help this either. They talk on the phone every afternoon and her mom always brings up how much she misses us and can't wait for us to visit. It'll only have been a day after we left their house. We don't really visit when we are there just stay over. Her dad works and her mom watches TV and gets on Facebook.

Honestly if it wasn't for my son I wouldn't want to be here anymore. My company offers life insurance and mine is at $20k that would go to her right now. That would be enough to bury me her to sell the house and get what she really wants which seems to be to live with her parents. 

She's also talked suicide and I don't know how to handle this. I feel trapped. If I say something the wrong way she snaps. I dread coming home from work in the afternoon. ",4
It's night and as usual that's when all these horrible thoughts come to my head. I know I'm not a terrible person but I haven't exactly had the best year so I feel kind of overwhelmed right now. I really need to talk to someone ASAP I don't feel good.,4
"I lived with him so I guess now I'm sleeping in my car until I figure out where to go. All of my friends were his and our closest ones were with him when I broke up with him so they're taking his side and won't talk to me. I feel so utterly alone right now. I hate myself. I know breaking up was a good thing because he was very controlling and only cared for himself, but I'm still so sad. He was the only person in my life that told me he loved me. When I was alone and broken he fixed me. Now I have nothing..",4
"Read the title... I was already dealing with a depressive episode and now this shit. Guys n girls, I think it's time for me to pass on to the next life/afterlife/darkness/otherside, or whatever you wanna call it. Keep living on for me. Happy new year! See you whenever.",5
"It feels like a vicious cycle. Im not allowed to leave my room until my HW's done (with the exception of eating meals). And because I cant focus, I don't get my work done. So I stay in my room like 80% of the time. The inablity to do anything stresses me out and makes me depressed. And because Im depressed, I cant focus on my work. So the work just piles up and up while I sit in my room, unable to get anything done.

I try and try to get my work done, and I know I can do it, *but it just doesnt happen*. It makes me feel like a big screwup compared to my sister, who when she was my age, almost always got grades above a B.

I need to brake the cycle, but I dont know where. Ive tried taking medicine to help me focus, but it doesnt seem to work. My semester ends in 2 weeks and I dont know what to do. ",2
Another NYE spent alone in my room hating my own guts. I can't tell what's worse --- my self pity that I have no friends and just watch snapchats of people having fun without me even though I know its self defeating ORRR the fact I really can't blame people for not inviting me out because even I hate spending time with myself. Add onto that my parents havent allowed me out of the house since I was released from the hospital for being suicidal. My world has become my room which just fucking feeds into my depression like water on a grease fire. God I'm so sick of being me.,4
"Good luck to all of you as you continue with your battle of depression and anxiety. I've come to the realization that, while I tried to help others with my previous posts, I'm only bringing myself down. I'm on a journey of self-love, and unfortunately, that means leaving quite a few things in the past, including this subreddit. Thank you for your time, and I wish you all my love.

"Fascinating. I did the same, stoped using fb as one of the first steps of getting better. But still use instagram.

"Iâm just so obsessed, with how I should look and appear to others. My mind always strives for perfection and I get very upset and worried when I donât achieve that. There are the things that I can work on, I usually do them as good as I can but then there are just things that I canât change, and itâs just fucking distressing and dreadful to my mind. 

I have a deep overbite, protruding ears and fat eyebrows, that has a weird horizontal blank mark on the right brow. Although the whole image of myself doesn't look too bad, despite my bad facial features, I just canât get over it. I have such things in my mind 24/7 and am extremely self-conscious about it. I can't eat or do anything with myself without having my mind in peace and I often just freak out on the inside when I compare myself to others. My negative thoughts have occasionally lead me to wanting to be dead and I know that they are often irrational.

Thereâs nothing I can think about to stop those thoughts, except to work on them and fix it with money, but the problem is that I donât have the money. Sorry if this post has gotten way too long, I just felt like I had to let those thoughts free into a post. I donât know.. Iâve been constantly having those thoughts since the past few months, and they get stronger as time goes on. I feel trapped in a cage with those thoughts, as there is nothing I can really do to improve such things as my facial features as an example.",4
"I'm severely depressed but not suicidal. I feel disconnected from almost everyone and everything. I know what needs to be done to change things but have no motivation to do so. There are times where I'm so down I just want to cry. I keep being told I'm a great guy, a good person, that I'm loved. Therapy, getting a pet, becoming a foster parent, and online dating have all been suggested today from my work spouse and one of my best friends. I tried a med change this month but it made things worse. I feel left behind, that I'm not living the life I should. Also told I don't give myself enough credit. Here's the thing, depressed and intelligent people are very in tune with their thought processes. I know I'm not terribly smart but I have eyes. I give myself exactly as much credit as I deserve and have very little to offer. Yes I have good qualities but they're dwarfed when compared to what others have to offer.

"I've been suffering from clinical depression for 6 months now and it took so much from me. I've had irregularities in my behavior ever since and obviously it took the attention of my friends.

One even just gave me advice to just ""help myself"". It feels like they think I'm using the ""I'm depressed"" as an excuse for every breakdown I have.

I feel guilty since on paper, it seems like I wouldn't be so depressed.

"I told myself to keep a fair amount of distance between myself and anybody back in high school, but you don't really change much when you get in college. I fell in love, and I tried to push out that thought. One sided on my part completely.

Before that, you and I were really close. But it turns out you were the same as anyone I tried to get close with. As soon as we get close, the further away we became. I wasn't oblivious to people pushing me away back then. I knew the signs, I know how to read in between the lines. So why give me mixed messages?

The amount of stress that whole thing caused me thinned out my hair. I already hate falling for someone, or in any case get too close with just about anyone, and then I had to trust you. I shouldn't have. I should have just kept you at bay like everyone else. Later on I knew that you slept with a friend of mine.

"I've never opened up to anyone, in person or anyone I know in person. I've only ever been honest when talking anonymously with strangers on the internet.

Basically this lame nearly-20 year old has wanted to die for five years and I'm now at the point where it's get help or just do it already. so I changed doctors, the switch finally went through today, but I can't bring myself to schedule an appointment. I've lied to my family, friends (the one I still have lmao), and doctors for years. How can I be honest now? 

does anyone else struggle with this? being unable to open up? I've emotionally isolated myself due to fear of vulnerability and self hatred and I don't know if I could ever open up during therapy, let alone at a doctors appointment about requesting therapy. I get shakey and anxious and want to puke just thinking about it.

It's so bad that I won't even come out as a lesbian, even though my family is very liberal and have told me multiple times if I was it'd be fine. but being honest/emotional/myself just feels terrifying. Obviously - I've never been in a relationship either because of it.

"She wants kids. I fucking despise children and cringe when one is around me. And I would have to have one around me every day as a father. I'd need to PRIORITIZE THEM over my own life. That's completely horrifying to me.

She's left. I'm right.

I drive her nuts all the time. I can't make her happy when she's sad.

I enjoy living a lazy, quiet lifestyle living off of SSI. I can't provide for a significant other.

I should be happy like this. I should be overjoyed. This way our bond won't be ruined when we inevitably couldn't stand each other any more and have an ugly breakup. 

So, why am I not? I can shrug off most rejections with ""she was too good for me, anyway"", leave it at that, and move on with my life.

So why am I not feeling any better when I can come up with a million more reasons why it would never work out in a million years? I know it's for the best. I've accepted it won't change. But it doesn't get better. It still hurts. And I never thought it would ever happen. My entire life I thought I was immune to this, because I never considered myself capable of falling in love in the first place.

But, here I am. And I still don't know how the fuck I ended up here. I still don't know why what happened happened. All I know is that I regret it ever happened. I wish I could go back in time and restrain myself and remind myself of the life I wanted to have, and not get this close.

But I didn't listen to myself. I foolishly let it happen, thinking it was fine. Never imagining it could come back to bite me later. But it did. I got too close. It got too serious. And now there's hell to pay. I have to carry this weight around for years. At the bare minimum. With therapy. And pills that don't work for jack shit. I may be like this forever. Some say it never truly gets better. It may not hurt as bad. But it's always going to hurt to some extent. And I don't believe people who say it'll pass. I think I'm damaged forever. And it's all because I was too goddamn naive to consider what might happen.

Is this the real reason why major lifestyle differences are such an immediate turn off and cause to break contact for most? Once political views and beliefs and values stop being a barrier, EVERYTHING does. It gets to the point where you want to stand by someone no matter how rotten they become. What vile things they do. Because you're used to doing it. Because you believe it's the right thing to do. And you won't listen if anyone tells you otherwise. It's the cruelest joke in the world- because you find yourself so obsessed and committed, and willing to do anything at all for someone, you can't stop loving them and move on, literally no matter WHAT happens. I could not have less in common with her if I tried. And yet, here I am. Hopelessly in love with someone who is never going to love me back. 

I never want to get this close to someone. Ever again. I don't want to feel pain and shock fresh ever again. I don't want to carry any more burdens around. The fact of the matter is, there's probably only one person in the world I was willing to consider breaking my dreams of living the free single life for. And she's not interested. All that's left for me is the idea and possibility of a life that I always wanted to live. And it doesn't make me happy. I'd give it all up for her in a heartbeat if I could.

Luckily for me, I have surefire female repellent, as if my very existence in and of itself wasn't enough of it. Apparently those of the female race think very lowly of men who pay for sex and want nothing to do with them, and certainly won't date them.

Well, screw 'em. If they don't want to give it to me, I am going to pay for it, in places where it's legal to do so. And then it'll be a damn sure thing I'll never find someone who wants me. Because I am going to tell ANYBODY who gets too close to me what I did. And then they'll make faces and run. I refuse to lie. How can you possibly love someone you're lying to and keeping secrets from? The entire relationship has a rocky foundation waiting to crumble if word ever surfaces. That's why I find it impossible to approach women. How am I supposed to say ""Hello, I am interested in you purely for your body"" and expect it to go over well? Because that's all you know about a girl at first glance. It's the only thing you COULD be interested in. But you can't say that. But lying is bad. And thus... the eternal dilemma. 

I should be happy. I get to live the life I always wanted to have. Going off to have legal sex with prostitutes. Doing whatever I want without any extra baggage to worry about. Knowing it all ultimately doesn't mean anything. It only does for a night. I should be overjoyed. My dreams will soon become a reality.

But I'm not happy. Because it's not what I truly want.

I can't have what I want. It's all merely settling for what I can have. Almost nobody gets to have what they truly want out of life. Even if what they want isn't something atrocious. But maybe it was an atrocious idea all along. Unconditional love doesn't truly exist, and I'm a warped human being who wants to believe it does.

I hope they legalize prostitution in the rest of America, besides Vegas. Maybe this never would have happened if there was just a more accessible place you could go to turn in your virgin card once you hit 18. Maybe I'd have been satisfied with meaningless one night stands with women sooner. Maybe I would have been spared all of this heartbreak and pain, and maybe I never would have gotten as close as I did.

But maybe I was going to anyway. Maybe it was always going to happen, regardless of if I wanted it or not. Maybe it was fate. Maybe fate really exists.

Or maybe none of this actually matters.

First day of 2017 and I already hate my life and everything.

"So today is still new years eve in the states. I'm on a relatively cheap vacation to ski country in Colorado that my brother won for $100 and only invited me cause I happened to be there when he won. 

Now last weekend at Christmas I met my cousin's gf (same age, 21) and she was great and talked all the the party so that made it bearable. Now I have developed some feels for this girl but she is already taken and by my cousin none the less so I feel even worse for liking her.

Then 20 minutes ago I see both of them in my hometown one carrying a case of beer. I've texted them to no response. Ditched, again.

Fuck this. I feel like no one really wants to be friends with me for myself. Like all my so called friends take advantage of me. I'm the only one with a pool, so they come here and include me of course because they want to have access to it I assume.

"Hello :)

I want to make this short. I was never diagnosed with depression, though my mum, ex-girlfriend and best friend who lived with me told me, that they assumed I was depressed. Whether thats true or not, I think I really need help with my life.

I gotta feeling that I don't do anything good with my life. I am just wasting time on the internet to distract myself.

I just want to know how to start to take action. I think I know excactly what I should do to become happy and to fix my life. I collected information, made daily tasks (which are totally possible to fulfill) and want to improve many aspects of my life, though i become overwhelmed. I don't even manage to stick to my healthy eating plan. So I end up doing nothing or just a few things and waste most of my time. I need to change something drastically.

So my question is: is there any trick to start taking action? Any form of mind trick? How can I motivate myself? I just need to go through some days to see the improvement and then hopefully it gets easier, but I need a start...and at the moment I feel like I am stuck in this pot of laziness, vegetating.

What helped you? How did you manage to achieve this initial burst of action?

Thank you so much! Every response will help me tremendously!",2
"I'm sorry.

My entire life, until recently, I thought depression was merely another word for being sad.  I had thought it was just a feeling that would quickly go away.  I had thought that depression was something that was not a big deal, that it was more of a joke than anything. Whether it be society telling me that it wasn't serious or if it was just me being nieve; I need you to know I'm sorry I held these beliefs. 

Until you experienced it, you can never really understand just how terrible and debilitating it is.  I read some of your stories and a peice of me breaks.  I can't even start to begin to comprehend how some of you must feel.  I don't want to downplay my own experience (because I now know depression, no matter the severity, is serious) but it seems so miniscule compared to some of your struggles.

I can't believe there was once a time where I would even ask my self, ""Why can't these people just be happy."". If only it was that easy.  I really wish it was.  From the bottom of my heart, I wish you the best in 2017.  Merry Christmas, happy holidays and make this year great.

I'm sorry.",0
Some way or another I got to pull myself out of this pit I'm in I'm probably the lowest I've ever been now and I need to get back up to where I was before I felt like this. When I think about it it seems so overwhelming to try and get out of this hell and to get better but what other options is there. I don't even know where to start but I need to be happy again I can't carry on like this otherwise what's the point. ,5
"I used to have goals. I wanted to be somebody that my parents would be proud of. I used to believe that I was destined for bigger things. Reality hit me. I'm not special, the world doesn't revolve around me. I exist but my existence is not as meaningful as I thought. I realized so many things about myself this last year. I'm not as smart as I thought I was. I'm not important to anybody. I have nothing to offer to the world. It's just a hard realization I came to. I was never meant to do anything but work a dead end job living paycheck to paycheck. I set a date for when I'm going to die. It's the only thing I feel like I have control over, but even then I don't know if I can hold on for a few more years. I'm struggling to find anything that will give me purpose to be here. I'm alive but every day is the same and all I want is purpose. Just any reason to keep going. The world is beautiful and there are so many reasons to not give up, but I can't find any right now. I wish somebody would notice that I'm not ok. I don't know what I'm holding on to right now. ",2
"It's six hours until New Year here and I just want to curl up and die.

I've had depression for as long as I can remember but it recently has become worse. My boyfriend of 2 and a half years (who I live and work with) broke up with two weeks ago. Tonight he has gone to one of our colleagues house parties, I wasn't invited. No one invited me anywhere and I don't blame them.

I'm not angry that he went, I am angry at myself. I have no friends, live miles away from any family and at the age of almost 28 have nothing to live for. I try to stay upbeat but I really don't see the point. I've alienated myself from everyone and this is what I get. I just want it all to be over.",4
"in the end we all die, nothing we do means anything so why do we do anything, throught life we endure bullshit and experience good times but the shitness is constant it never leaves. Sometimes i would rather not exist or atleast, have a purpose a drive to live, for i always feel numb, there are brief moments were i can have good times but it takes all my being to maintiain. 

I sit here  wondering if there will be any true enjoyment in life, from what im surrounded by the drivel of normal life, is that what my fate is? a life of mundane bullshit of pointless relationships of sitting around doing nothing at all and even when something good comes along eventually it leaves that is the duality of life misery and happiness both ever flowing rivers which is not a bad thing, if it were not  for the fact that the ""good times"" seem to feel empty still  in the end there is still no reason no purpose we exist just waiting for the day we die.

In all things i thought had meaning, things that i thought i had pleasure in doing feel more and more empty to the point where i dont think i truly enjoy anything. So where does that leave me with no purpose no enjoyment just the goings of noraml life that is what i have to look foward to? in a sense that is hell, i can enjoy it for a while but not much longer than a month for i cannot exist just to enjoy life and have fun or some bullshit about finding love, pfff  that crap never lasts most of us fear loneliness, that is why we marry or spend long times with one person but eventually you will get tired of that person or they will lose their interest.

I have no idea why i feel the way i do, as if im completely blank that the idea of continuing this drives me insane i could not endure this. In the end i still do not understand how i feel im lost utterly searching for reason, but i doubt i will find it in this existence. I continually observe many other people and ponder how they enjoy what they do, just hanging with friends dating someone having a job, that is all they need it does not make sense.

"I got a guitar for myself this Christmas. My family kind of ignored me this year for Christmas, but that's par for the course....Either ignore or belittle me, one or the other. Anyways. I started playing again. It was a random idea, honestly, a 'good day', where I passed the local music store and saw one in the window. I'm broke, to be honest, but I figured I'd stop in and talk to them to see if they had any cheapies. 

What do you know, my old music teacher was in there talking with them. I haven't seen him in four years, and back then I was okay. Fuck, I was more than okay. I was a greek god for all I was concerned. He actually didn't recognize me, not that I don't blame him. I've gained a bit of weight and I have a bad habit of not taking care of my hair..After talking to him for a little while, and explaining the new idea, he said that he was actually here to sell his guitar. He said if I wanted it, it was mine, so long as I promised to play it pretty often. It's not new or a beauty, but it meant a lot, especially since I look like unmotivated scum.

Anyways. There's my hope for the day. I've been playing that.

Unhopeful. I've been hearing shit that other people can't hear? I can distinguish that it's not like...Real...But it sounds like someone is whispering in my ear. Like I can feel the tingling of breath sometimes on it? It's kind of freaking me out...I was wondering if it would make sense to bring it up to a doc or professional, or if they'd just lock me up...Particularly because sometimes it says really, really bad shit. Like right now it's telling me to kill myself. 

Okay. Two things for y'all.

Much love....May 2017 be better to you all.",5
"For the past week (Maybe more ? Can't remember) I've maybe taken my antidepressants twice instead of every morning, because I'm dumb and keep forgetting or thinking it's fine, and now my head is killing me, I feel like I'm going to throw up 24/7, I've been having nightmares and I basically feel like shit.

Don't be me kids.",3
"I am at a hotel in a foreign country. There is a party going on in the lobby that all my friends are at. I left to lie in bed (where I currently am). They are coming to get me soon even though I really don't want to go back down there.

This year has been the toughest in my life and I just found out next year I likely won't be accepted to med school.

Idk how to move on. I know I'm being a buzzkill tonight but I seriously just can't bring myself to get back down there. 

To everyone feeling shitty this New Year's Eve, you are not alone. Hopefully we all find a way forward.",5
"I'm frustrated with my life. I have very few friends, and as a 20 year old college student about to turn 21 it's driving me crazy to realize that I can't celebrate it with anyone. My closest friends are all younger than me, and 2 of the closest are 16 (don't worry, I met them through my job, I'm not a pedophile), so I feel pathetic for being unable to make friends my own age. It's just plain creepy. Only thing that keeps people from calling me out is that I look only a year older than them.
 
I'm gay, in a hyper conservative family, so I can't please anyone in it. I live at home, so my life is restricted a lot (due to paying college expenses). My parents frequently remind me of my lack of friends and constantly question if I'm trying to sleep with every male I talk to, and particularly question my friendship with anyone younger than me. They think that because I'm gay, I'm a pedophile.

The few friends I had my own age ditched me because they think me being gay is disgusting. I try approaching the LGBT groups on campus but I feel like they'll ostracize me for other reasons.

 I feel like I was cheated my teenage years by my restrictive parents, now I'm lonely and angry at everyone around me for having what I couldn't. My siblings are successful, and I feel like the dissappointment and failure of the family. 

I have much more anger but these are the ones that keep popping up today, and I just wanted to vent about it somewhere.",4
"I have no happiness in my life at all, I try and distance myself emotionally from my family because it's easier that way than feeling guilt and them not understanding. Not even music or tv shows give me a moment of happiness I just feel disgust and more sadness. It would just be better if I died

Usually I use music and tv as a coping mechanism In trying to destruct myself but it's not working anymore and I'm scared at this point",5
"That have never had a fun New Years? 

No one invites me to anything and it just feels fucking horrible. I asks people if they're doing anything and I just get a ""Idk"" and then on new years I see that they're on a cool party or something that seems nice. Here I am with my pc and suicidal thoughts listening to my parents fucking party that drives me nuts.

Every year it's the same fucking thing. 
Fuck new years",4

"With all these festivities going on, I can't help but grow increasingly cynical and bitter. Greeting 2018 in a mere few hours with complete lack of hope and optimism. Though I know as time goes by, this too shall pass, but knowing it and feeling it are two completely different things.",5
"I spent the last few hours of New Years Eve alone crying. Crying because of everything.

The stress of college, my anxiety, my loneliness, no one likes me at school even though I do try, people hate me when I haven't done anything to them, parents that won't help me, an emotionally abusive father, I'm in an online relationship that seems bleak more and more everyday, my boyfriend is out with all his friends and I'm here alone in pain. 

I had hoped we would spend the night talking together.. but that's no fun is it? I shouldn't expect him to want to spend time with me 

I wish I had killed myself last night, he wouldn't have even noticed I was gone",2
"And judging by my user name, I'm sure you can guess what I'm talking about. I just set up this account, kind of a throwaway, sorta, but lord knows that since I have so much more time on my hands, might be using it more often.

Goddamn, how did I even manage to get away with it that long? It feels like wants to give me nice things, a job, a car, a nice girlfriend, and then subsequently take them away from me: Fights with my girlfriend, a fucking car accident, getting fired, and all of this only 6 months after my mom died right before my graduation ceremony from high school?

I know I fucked up at my job, it was completely my fault, I can't fucking wake up on time, even when I have ~50 alarms set. I'm fucking useless, that's literally all it is. I'm fucking done. I just want to die. My username is basically the motto I use every fucking night when I'm drenched in tears, begging a god I don't believe in to just take the last thing I have left (my life) because I don't fucking want it anymore, it's shit, I obviously don't know how to do ""life"" anyway, so it might as well just fucking end.

I spent so much time with my friends and they invited me to everything. I invited them to do stuff. We had a great time and we did everything together and talked to each other about everything. Now they have ditched me. I never get invited to anything. It's like they don't know me. I didn't do anything differently they just stopped inviting me to hang out. I don't get it. I'm not even depressed now I am just at the point that I don't care anymore. So now I have gone in one year from being kind of cool with everyone then being really awesome and fun and everybody liked me and I was invited to everything to now not being invited to anything and none of the people that were my friends caring to ask me to hang out. I didn't do anything different. I was myself the whole time. They liked me for years and then the moment I feel like they are my 2nd family I get cut off.,4
"My weight has always been a source of sadness and insecurity. People always need to point out how I look, whether it be anorexic when I was sad or chubby when I started feeling a bit happier again. A few days ago I found out my family called me fat behind my back. It's been ringing in my head ever since. I cannot fucking stop thinking about it. It's making me want to start starving myself again. I've been crying all morning because i had a stress dream about my weight. I don't wanna fucking be like this. ",4
"Hi, IÂ´ve just written this little text while on the bus. Hope someone likes it and\or finds it useful. My relation with poetry is a bit sad, I live in a family completely science-orientated, and my dreams of writing literature has always been discarded as bullshit, as I had no talent for it.

Hope you like it!

When you look into the abyss

And the abyss looks into you,

Penetrating, objective,

He analyzes your insides

and devours your name.


----------------------------


But sometimes, only sometimes,

when you look into the abyss,

He ignores you, threes not even silence.

And nothing happens at all.


----------------------------


You would give all to the abyss,

just to get devoured by him,

Annihilation is all you ave left,

but even the abyss doesn't care about you.


----------------------------


Desperate, you cry:

âWho am I?â

Please, I just want to hear a voice.

It does not matter if it is true or not,

I just need an answer,

because that would mean I am something,

to someone.



----------------------------
However, the only thing you can hear,

is the silence in past conversations.

----------------------------


You cry, and emptiness conquers you,

the beauty of your words no longer matters,

if not even the abyss hears them.

----------------------------


Everything looks so simple, 

filling my emptiness would be so simple...


----------------------------

I just need to be answered,

be something to someone,

be mentioned, praised or even insulted,

But be called.

----------------------------


Only then,

When even the abyss abandoned me,

I discovered the formula to smile again.


----------------------------

And you feel the taste of a tear,

that has slipped into your tongue,

Cached by a smile.

----------------------------


This must be hope...",2
"1. ""You just have to wait for the right time. Stop trying. You're still young. You'll find the right person eventually."" 
This is literally just you pushing the problem off onto whoever I'm with the next time I'm having a bad day. And not everyone does fall in love. I find it more likely I'll be dead before that ever happens.

2. ""You have to love yourself before anyone else will love you.""
Then I guess I'm fucked. I don't love me. I despise me. So does everyone else. That's why I'm here.

3. ""Being in a relationship won't fix your depression.""
No shit. But you know what, I'm pretty sure having someone around who tells me they love me and hugs me when I'm sad sure wouldn't make things any worse.

4. ""You just gotta get out there and meet more people.""
Rejection is a bummer, but if you also get the occasional date from trying, then it makes up for it. The problem with that is that the people like me who only ever get rejected feel even more like shit and don't want to put themselves up to that repeatedly.

I'm sure there are others that I have grown tired of hearing, but I can't think of them at the moment. Basically, does anyone have any actually helpful advice for someone who is struggling with finding love?",5
"First post here, and I actually hoped that I never felt like I needed to address these things. 

It's new years eve, its 5am here in Denmark. And i'm done.

So long story short.
I was 130kg (287 pounds) at 15 years old. My parents pretty much didnt really care, and all that.
When i turned 15, i knew there was 6-7 months for high school to start, so i joined a gym. Read all i could online. Lost 40kg, at for the first time looked like a human being. Yet, I couldnt get with any girls. I was pretty much ""broken"" in the head for being too fat and weird. I didnt give it. I read Mystery Method, The Game, practiced all the time, and had some luck. I finished high school, and after that, my genetics pretty much fucked me over. 

Keep in mind, I work out 5 days a week. I even became a personal trainer. But my genetics makes it very difficult to lean down all the way, and i also (like my father, and brother) have a pretty chubby face.  im in my mid 20's and my hair is thinning so bad, and people keep mentioning this. 

Im the ugly guy, in my group, even though im the person who spends most time taking care of myself. But im just ""gentically ugly"" so to speak. Ive seen so many girls around me, hook up with wrong guys, and ""friend zoning"" me. I had a crush on a girl, who hooked up with a 20 year old idiot douche, just because he is better looking, basically because of genetics. 

I hate this. I dont deserve it. I always try my hardest. Best at my school at software programming, best at most things that I do, because i keep figting for what i want. But I dont wanna do this shit anymore. Im giving up. Im not getting any ""wins"" with my life. I see myself struggling and fighting so much more than other people my age...

im in my mid 20's. This should be the best years of my life, but im only getting uglier, and I cant take it anymore...

I dont even know why im writing this. Guess sometimes its just nice to feel that you are being heard...",4
"I really need some advice on how to get my life together. Im at a point where i dont even want to live anymore, but I wont actually kill myself. Because I guess I have a LITTLE hope left in me.

Im 18 and ive only had 1 to 2 friends for the last 5 years. Ive focussed on every other aspect of my life, exercise, diet, taking every natural supplement, but at the end of the day i realize I need a social life, i need real happiness. Im at a point where Im really hopeless and I need some guidance. im a guy btw. How did you get over social isolation, and any advice on how I can? Thanks...",5
"Hey r/depression.
I am in therapy (although very irregularly due to financial restrictions) and I have loving friends and family members yet I do not know how to ask for help.
I saw my therapist last week for the first time in a few months (I was doing absolutely awful during those) and pretended like everyhing is okay. I have talked to her about my issues before and she even helped me find a psychiatrist.
My friends and some family members also offer support and repeatedly tell me that I just need to hit them up if I need help. Because I feel like I'm just a burden on everyone who has ever interacted with me before I never do so.

How the hell do I get over myself and actually ask others for help? What would I even say? I can't just walk up to someone and go ""I want to die and I feel like I am unable to cope with just existing.""

tl;dr not able to ask for help because I feel like I annoy everyone. How do I get over this issue?",5
"I've been going out with her for a little bit. She's told me she loves me a lot, but the past couple months i've made her feel unwanted. After she told me this and basically hinted that she wants this to be over, I realized that I have some deep rooted issues. I'm not happy (with myself), I haven't been happy for over a decade. I've faked it for so long, but I just hid all my unhappiness and now it's starting to come to me. I haven't wanted to wake up, I don't want to kill myself, but I don't care to live. Being alive just feels like my punishment for being a bad person. 

Here's this beautiful and great girl who loves me, and I've pushed her to the side and made her feel unwanted. Just so I can spend time by myself, alone, with my thoughts, because that should be how I feel. Alone and awful. And I hurt her in the process. She may be over me soon....but I won't be over her for a long time. And I need to let her go, I need to let her out of my toxic orbit. It hurts to know I've lost one of my best friends, but it's the only way I know how to get over someone. She deserves better than me anyway. 

TL:DR? My GF and I are going to stop seeing each other, I've been a shitty person and deserve to be alone.",4
"Everything went to shit right after my first semester.

My grades were shit because I barely studied. I dissapointed my dad yet again, I might loose my dorm room if this financial shit doesn't work out, and I need a 3.0 or I'm going to end up owing a shitload of money.

Thats not even the worst part.

I was so ready to do the work next semester to make up for it. Then my fucking girlfriend left me.

I'd known her since my first fucking year a high school and now shes gone. I'm only 18 so yeah doubt me all you want, but give it a few more years, and I could've seen myself with this girl for the rest of my life. Now she doesn't want to be in my life anymore and I'll never get to see her or talk to her again.

How the hell am I supposed to study when I'm going to be all fucked up for a while. Its been less than 24 hours and I've just been in a drunk and stoned fuckin state functioning through my fucking day. I'm fucking snowed in alone can't even fucking talk to anybody.",2

"Idk if this is because of depression but every time my parents or siblings are nice to me I feel very upset. I can't really describe or explain it but it's a mixture of extreme sadness and anger. It makes no sense to me. It happens mostly with my parents because they show the most affection to me and every time the hug, compliment or talk well of me to others I just get so upset. Sometimes when they hug me I even feel like crying. It's very strange. This doesn't happen with friends btw. ",0
"Holidays often feel like a painful reminder of what I want more than anything - a group of friends to celebrate with, a special someone to spend the night with, and freedom from all of my social anxiety.  

Something so simple as sending a quick merry Christmas text to my crush is so difficult for me, but this year I found a way to do it.   Getting a response back while I was in the car on my way to seeing relatives I wasn't looking forward to seeing made me smile and feel for a brief moment like I'm a normal person who could have those things.  

I wish that feeling could stay and not feel like an illusion that vanishes too fast.

Seriously, it's not just a case of me still thinking that it's 2017, it's more of that I almost feel like I... slept through 2017 or something.  I feel the same with the latter half of 2016.  I remember 2017, I suppose, but I don't really feel like I LIVED through 2017.  The entire year feels like a blur, and no other year from my memory feels like that.",5

I just kept wishing that I had someone who loved me the way they loved each other. That I could have dreams that could actually become a reality someday. That I could be someone special instead of another sad lonely person waiting for a miracle that will never happen.

"Does anyone else have even more of a hard time with depression in the winter?  I go to work and it is dark, I get out and it is dark.  It is too cold to go hiking, or even be outside, which is one of the only things I have left that helps me feel better.  I go home and sleep from 6pm till the next morning, i just can't do it anymore.  I wish I was in a financial place that would let me move out of Michigan..",2
"I talk a lot, fairly flippantly usually, because that's what you do when you've had depression your whole life I guess, about hating myself, but I was just thinking about it, and I don't think I actually do. 
(This is not a positive post, by the way, this like... gets worse from here, my head is in a super bad place and I really somewhere to vent where no-one irl is gonna see it. Just a warning.)
See I think hating or loathing someone takes this huge amount of energy. You have to be conscious about it. I think that's why it's not unusual for someone who really hates them self to also be pretty narcissistic. 
But for me, it's not a big effort. I don't hate myself, I just.. don't like myself. 
It's kind of like, when you have a group of friends, and there's one person in the group and you just don't get why anyone likes them. It's not mean-spirited, necessarily, you just don't find them interesting, or funny, or smart. They're not good-looking enough for you to think that that's why people still seem to like them. And you don't think about it all the time, maybe, but it bugs you. You find yourself rolling your eyes when they talk. When they're at events you're like ""seriously? who invited them?"" 
But when they're not around, you don't even think of them. They don't take up enough of your notice- they aren't remarkable enough- for you to devote any extra thought to. 
And I guess if I could sum that up in a word, that's how I feel about myself.

"Within just two days I managed to drive a close friend out with my own conflicting emotions, be hit with 4 dysphoria attacks, and continue to feel abandoned, neglected, and blatantly ignored by the people that I consider my friends. With my current home life I don't have access to therapy either and truthfully, I don't know how much that would help.
I fucking hate being like this. I fucking hate having such conflicting emotions all the time, I always want to go to my friends for help but every time I try, I chicken out because I feel like I'm pressuring them, or that I'd just be even more of a burden to them.
At least I still have some things to help cope, I suppose.

"17 years old here.
Tl;dr: Have been ""clean"" of depression for about a year, depression came back, I write a list of things i want to achieve within the next 6 months, if I fail achieving all of the things I will commit suicide and give up forever.
Having had depressions since I was a child (always hated myself, was never satisfied with myself, even had suicidal thoughts at the age of 8, being sad and lazy, having no motivation for anything). Around 14 months ago I told myself I am gonna fight this, I will not let my life be controlled by this sickness. I completely started my life all over again. I fought my porn and alcohol addictions (I live in Germany, here it is no problem for people under 16 to have access to cheap alcohol). I got rid of toxic friends, started working out (a lot), changed my diet and got more social. I even got a bit into meditation. Focusing a lot more on important things like sports, school/education. I really got back on track and thought that I had beaten my depression completely.
After some time I finally felt true happiness. I found good friends with which i had a lot of fun and which i truely love. And it went on like this for actually a lot of time.
And then it all slowly crept up on me again...
I dont know why, I dont know when exactly...
About 2 months ago I started feeling inner changes. Doing things that usually would be extremely exciting to me did not bother me anyway, when I did them I did not feel any emotions at all (for example illegally climbing up a crane for the first time in my life; i did not feel fear while doing it or relief/happiness afterwards)
In general I just recognized some kind of neutrality towards life; i did not have any real emotions anymore. It became stronger with time. 
That is just how it started, a lot of events were since then (dont want to bother you with things that are not relevant/interesting, so i keep it short) like severe injury, finding a girlfriend, stress in general. And yesterday my whole life just flipped and the depression train got a full body hit on me. My girlfriend more or less broke up with me, my best friends hate me now and my family is mad.
I never thought that I would have depressions again but well there they are: crying, self hatred, suicidal thoughts, social isolation, energylessness, bed ridden, not having eaten or drunk water for 2 days, not having washed or changed clothes for 3 days.
Well after a lot of thinking I came to a conclusion:
I will write a list of things I want to achieve until first of July 2018 (exactly half a year). If i achieve all of these things, fine. If not, I will commit suicide. And I take this dead seriously - If I cannot get my life back on track I do not see any reason in living anymore. I could do it once but it only helped temporarily. So if I cant even do it again, my life will be bullshit forever and i dont want that.
Luckily I am fucking afraid of death (which is good because that way I have never tried suicide but only had a lot of thoughts about them) so I have a lot of motivation to actually achieve all the things on the list. I DO NOT FUCKING WANT TO DIE so I really have a very good motivation, but if I fail I will overcome my fear, because I MUST die, there is no other rational option.
If anybody is interested what some of the points on my list are (i havent worked it out completely yet):
-130kg bench press as 1RM
-250kg deadlift as 1 RM (yes I am very sports focused)
- having an average grade of 1.5 or better (which is extremely good in the german school system)
- losing my virginity
- earning 1000â¬ with side jobs

These are hard goals, but with enough work I can achieve them and I will start out extremely dedicated and set a symbol. For the first week of 2018, so the next 7 days, I will close away my smart phone, not have any social interactions, working ALL day (learning a lot, reading a lot, starting meditation, working out, cooking amazing meals)
The only thing that concerns me is that propably some of my friends will not be able to accept my new strict form of living (and propably be mad that I didnt talk to them for 7 days without warning them before) but I have no problem with making sacrifices like those to earn my right of surviving.",4
"Hi,
My parents love me, unconditionally, they want the best for me, they have sacrificed a lot for me to come to where I am now, I got a high score in my final exams and I want to become a politician, but my parents won't let me because of the ""sins"" that will be committed, I am religious, the reason I want to become a politician is because my native culture is DYING in my country, the my culture is part of the majority ethnic group, our ethnic group's culture is being wiped off, the government stopped teaching my country's history so children become less patriotic, the police are corrupted, and many more atrocities are committed by the government.

It is my dream, but if I ditch my parents I would want to kill myself, I would not be able to hold in the guilt. My dad also believes that if the elders of the party order you to do something and you don't do it, because it is not moral or just plain stupid,they will kick you off the party, can't I just create my own party?

This post may be a little stupid, but I need some advice. 

Thank you so much! :)

PS: Yeah, I know politicians are crooks, especially in my country, but I am becoming one also because of this reason, too many crooks in my country's government.  :P",1
"It's like a deep feeling that I'm just gonna ruin everything all over again. and that everyone will just leave me behind because of me.
It's only 11:14AM since I tried sleeping in to skip the day, and then sleep for longer at nighttime. It's like a collection of suicidal thoughts and anxieties only over one year.

WeÂ´ve been dating long-distance for 3 years. He used to love me to the moon and back. HeÂ´s from NZ and IÂ´m from Mexico, heÂ´s 22 and IÂ´m 31. He had already broken up with me 3 months ago saying that his feelings for me were fading away but he already had a plain ticket to come see me for November. 3 days ago he broke up with me saying that he needs to be alone, that he needs to figure things out, that the distance is too hard (We were planning on me moving there in 2 years until he finished university) we already had been through 3 years together, 3 very hard years as well where my father died and I lost my mind to depression and anxiety. He says he doesn't love me anymore at least not like a partner but that heÂ´ll always love me as a friend. Could this be the depression? he says he doesn't know what he wants and that he just wants to be alone. I don't know what to do here since I was working a job that I didn't really liked but that would give me lots of job opportunities in NZ i was planning my future around him. I battled depression as well and the last thought in my mind was breaking up with him. Which is why I canÂ´t understand why he broke up with me. He says he needs all his focus on himself to get better but I didn't need that when I went through depression. ",4

"Happiness seems like a myth. I never meet happy people. I see instead people who understand how empty life really is, and attempt to spread happiness and be interesting, at the most.

I see people with beautiful appearances not looking happier than anyone else. What I see is (MOST of) them visibly, sadistically enjoying their genetic superiority, walking around like they're broadcasting how they are better than everyone. It's repulsive. Sometimes, I even see entire families of beautiful people, collectively showing body language in this way. That's even worse.

"I hate that you have no defense when someone disagrees with you. ""It's your depression talking."" No, shithead, maybe you're treating me like crap and I have a legitimate reason to be unhappy about that. Except you have to defend that because the immediate assumption is you being negative - and you're not even sure yourself. You practically help them gaslight you.

I hate that the only people who talk to you are miserable failures like yourself, talking about being miserable failures. What you need is a way out of hell, not more company there. And most functional people either don't know what the hell is like, or having left, can't go near it for fear of being dragged back. I know I wouldn't want to.

I hate that it fills you with so much energy and takes away any ability to release it.

I hate that your choices with most new people are to be a non-entity, or a drain on their energy because they have to deal with you.

I hate that for most of the medications I've tried anyway, it doesn't take away the sad, it merely allows you to function through it. Even if it does, it ultimately isn't enough if you don't have at least a bit of genuine happiness to hold on to.

I hate that you start to despise the coping mechanisms that you develop. You're in a world of swimmers and you aren't even treading water; you're drownproofing.

"Hi everyone,

First time posting here, so apologies if this is out of place.

I'm currently a 19 year old that's just started at university in Montreal, Canada. I've recently come to accept that I may have been dealing with depression throughout my life. If I think back, there have always been these periods where I've felt like I've been just barely holding on and every experience is muted. Then I come out of it and everything seems fine. Then the cycle repeats.

I've been reluctant to seek help or talk about this due to a number if factors. I'm too proud -- I hate admitting that I'm not managing the little things we have control over in life. In the positive periods, it's so easy to forget the dark ones. They've been just enough to propel me through the standard hallmarks of being ok, and then I think ""surely it can't be *that* bad"". Third, I'm still heavily dependent on my parents financially. That's sort of an endless cycle and I'm not exactly in a position to break it atm.

This past month has been the third time in 6 months that I've hit another low point, and each has been progressively lower. This time, I'm really terrified of the thoughts that keep coming up. Earlier they came up, but I was able to push them aside. Now they come up and I'm seriously (almost calmly) considering them. I've never felt more hopeless in my life. Obviously, this has been affecting me more than usual and I feel like everything is going downhill. Other than my family, I'm really reluctant to talk about it with my friends because I'm worried about how it would affect them since I know a number of them have mental illness.

I finally tried talking about how I've been feeling with my parents in these last weeks. That culminated in them finally accusing me of being a self-centered liar who was just saying things to get attention, blaming me for ""accepting negative thoughts from other people"", asking me if I'm possessed by some evil, and threatening to beat me and pull me out of university. So obviously getting their help to deal with this is not an option (which shouldn't surprise me tbh). 

I feel like I'm on the brink of really messing up, and I know it's my responsibility to seek help for this. Even if there's no way to beat it, I want strategies to make sure it never hits me this hard again. 

**Does anyone here have any tips on where to find free or low cost mental health support from professionals, general or specific to my situation? Any words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated** :)",2
"I've slipped into a bout of depression. Ive also come to the conclusion that the xmas/new year period sucks.

Ive had a number of job changes and have moved between cities this year. Also had a gf but i dumped her after i caught her being intimate with someone else. 

I moved back home when i found out my mum has cancer. I got another job which i find stressful. I dont get paid a lot but i do my best. Leading up to xmas i was doing 60-70 hour weeks and fell sick due to burnout. Xmas sucked. I was bed ridden the whole day.

I went back to work for a couple of days after xmas with a rotten attitude. I felt undervalued and no longer motivated. And i felt so shit at my job and made some bad mistakes. 

I do my best to help my mum. Out of the blue one day my mum tells me that she is no longer proud of me. This hurt.

My best friend recently moved to the other side of the world.

I noticed recently that struggle to make friends and really dont want another gf. To compensate for this i became a workoholic.

There is more to this picture but i cant bothered explaining in further detail. The short version of this story is: im really fucking depressed. No motivation and beginning to think that i cant trust anyone and like everyone in my life thinks that they are better than me.

"My family, my friends, I care about all of them. Very deeply. But I'm a ghost. Its funny, I'm typing all this out with a smile on my face. I'm in a great mood, had a fun day, played some video games online with my brother, had lunch with my sister, spent a bit of time with my roommates. I love all of them very much, but they don't know they're talking to a ghost. I'm alive, I'm somewhat happy in a way, but I haven't been entirely âhereâ in a long time. It's like a part of me is somewhere else, a far away place I'll never reach. I have lived in this depression for so long that it's become my home, it's not something I think I can escape anymore.

They know I'm depressed but I think it's really difficult for them to actually relate or understand. They know that majority of the time I'll refuse to hang out so they just hang out without me most of the time. It's strange but it still feels really shitty like it's some sort of betrayal. They are the only two friends I have. It sucks. ",4
"Today is another really low day for me. I can feel myself slipping away and becoming more depressed from each and every passing second, but I still have a feint voice in my mind that is saying, âYou should get up and do something, even just walk around.â I haven't had the will power to do anything; I barely care enough about getting up for work, but I am thankful that I currently won't let myself starve or be homeless.

I was forcibly admitted to the hospital twice for attempted suicide (pills, and cutting respectively) and eventually got hooked up with a sliding scale office that had therapists in the West Seattle area that got me on a biweekly visit and eventually prescribed antidepressants. 

Over the past three years, I have moved multiple times, to different states, and recently moved back to Washington State. I had a counselor in West Seattle that got me the recommendation for antidepressants and they seemed to work for me; but after moving around (and losing most everything I owned in the process) I am thinking I need to get back to both therapy and medication; however, I don't remember her name or phone number. West Seattle is a long distance from where I currently live in Federal Way, but I don't know anywhere else to turn to.

Does anybody have an idea of how to find a sliding scale clinic in the area? When I google sliding scale clinics, I don't get many, if ANY, therapists, just dentists and pediatric doctors.

"You know those times where absolutely everything is just falling apart that you can almost time it by your watch for when the next thing will blow up? Well, there was car issues, pipes froze in my house (because I was dumb), more stuff went and then yesterday I lost a friend because saying that I was lonely  and I mentioned she hasn't visited my new place yet = ""I want to fuck you big time"". We were in the same depression mental health group for 5 weeks together, so she should have understood what I was meant rather than this girl logic and then blocking me without appeal.

Anyways! That isn't the end of it. This one is a totally isolated case from the last but I lost ANOTHER friend. Back to back days. The house is falling down and it decides to drop the toilet on my head for good measure when it's crumbling around me (and it's filled with crap). Anyways! I'll give the quick version. We met on Tinder. Talked for 2 months, had sex a few times a month ago. She was busy with work for the last couple of weeks coming up on Xmas. I wished her a merry Christmas and she replied on the 25th. We talked about meeting up when she was back in town and she said she would let me know with a smiley emoticon.. Normal fare right? Not with passive aggression in play... We didn't chat these entire 5 days until she messaged me in the morning today... I was completely blown away by how fucking dumb this was. I'll just copy paste it...

""Hey XXXXXX, I've had some time to think and, I'll be honest, I don't think I want to see you again. The first time we met I told you that I'm an egalitarian, and so far you have somehow managed to be racist, sexist, homophobic, and xenophobic and I just can't see past that. Whatever this was was fun for a bit, but it was ruined for me by all the hateful shit you say. Maybe take some time and figure out why you see the world the way you do.""

Out of ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE. I looked back over my entire SMS history to find absolutely anything off key and I couldn't find a single thing. It gets even more stupid and this is how I knew I was dealing with a completely fucked person and it wasn't anything I did.

I replied to her ""I hope one day you develop a mental disease so I can come chop you down at your knees"" (referring to her cutting me apart over my severe depression altering how positively I see the world and hoping that what goes around comes aroubd) and this fucking nut responds to me ""a normal person wouldn't blah blah blah, you *albeist* fuck"". She COMPLETELY loses the plot and insinuates that I hate disabled people because I hoped that she got her just desserts with someone shitting on her when she's vulnerable like I am... Like.. I can't make this stuff up guys.. 

That's where the ball stops with me and I just let her have it. So much BS packed into this and continually tell her ""what is your deal, I don't get it"" and ""you know you're busting down a sweet guy for no reason right?""

This is an open and shut case. We have here a nut case. Rhyme time. She's one of those people that takes everything way too seriously and makes life a real misery for people that don't conform to her exact wording/lifestyle.

THIS was the most fucked up thing though.... We talked for 2 entire months and there was absolutely no scent of crazy fucker to be smelt. She snuck right up on me and suckerpunched me with this nonsense. This is a lesson that everyone should learn. People are really fucking awesome at faking being a nice person that's there for you and if you so happen to have higher stakes such as a child or a joint bank account with one of these sleeper cells, that is some really scary shit and it could hurt a lot of us..

Anyways, I'm just kind of numb to all of this bad news lately.. It hasn't really hurt me like a break up with a loved one would. But it makes me look inward and wonder if I'm a bad person? We only ever shared happy times and laughs and I tried to convey that I'm a sweet person (her car was vandalized and I was offering to come down and assist her and I only knew her for 2 weeks. Stuff like that) but then this almost conspiracy like fog comes back around me and fucks yet another relationship up. What does everyone think of this one?

(I have to add that this is a person whom conversed with me for many months and did me several times. She had no problem fucking a bigot because I'm not one and I don't think if anyone who had that big of a problem with those types of people, would have sex with someone like that. So I don't want people to think that I'm wearing Nazi hats, saying gas the Jews while I punch a woman in the face and spit on a minority... Not even close, you don't even know...) ",4

Not really the same person anymore, I used to be this emotional person that let people walk over them but now I'm kinda the opposite and I hate it in a way because I'd pretty much rather be an emotional sensitive wreck than an emotionless person that keeps to themselves. Deep down I crave the feeling of love though, but I'm just scared of it all because I haven't felt it in so long. I'm scared I'm never gonna be able to let anyone in ever again and I'm gonna be lonely my whole life. I feel so far away from everything and I can't seem to connect with anyone anymore, that's life I guess; waiting for the day this all goes away and everything feels bright again. It'll come. ",4

She won't take me to the hospital. I just turned 17 and this is the third year I've been dealing with depression. I want to hug somebody I'm so sad ",4
"When I am in the midst of hell, crippling, debilitating depression (much like now)  I always repeat one line from a song called ""Mamma Sed"" by Puscifer over and over again.  It doesnt help at first, but the more time that passes the more sense it starts to make.  Here is the lyric:

""Momma said, like the rain, this too shall pass.  Like a kidney stone, this too shall pass.""

I just love it because the cliche saying ""like the rain this too shall pass"" doesn't exactly capture what we go through in times like these. But ""like a kidney stone""  sums it up just perfectly.  What you are experiencing is going to hurt like FUCKING HELL.  It will be one of the most painful things you will ever go through...but...it will pass.

I've been trying to hint and my parents that I'm not depressed (I am a little) but I've got really bad anxiety and I need help but it just seems to fly right over their heads I don't know how they haven't noticed or if they have why the haven't said much about it they just keep asking if I'm ok every now and again that's it. But I was thinking even if I did sit down and tell them I find it hard to put into words what's actually going on inside the crazy head of mine. How would you describe your situation?,4
"after a 3 year hiatus of putting off medication and therapy, I finally made the dreaded decision to start again (just drugs for now I think, we'll see how that goes) and asked for my mother to schedule an apt. this is for severe anxiety, social anxiety (or avpd) and depression (diagnosed those 3 years ago).

my mind is blank and I am not sure how to express / describe myself so that they can effectively gather information and prescribe the drugs they see fit. I'm afraid of freezing up and being incapable of speaking honestly. but knowing this is my anxiety speaking, it'll probably go well and be over before I know it... or it could seem to last an eternity and I'll feel trapped the whole time, as per usual.

"so i'm 16, a junior in high school. my whole life i've struggled with confidence in my abilities. i doubt myself a lot and i'm aware of it, but i can't seem to stop doing it. 
but like anyone else my age, i have my permit and i get my license in 6 months.  however, i don't like to drive. i haven't driven since the week after i got my permit, 6 months ago. i'm not scared i'm going to get in an accident or hurt somebody or anything like that. when i did my 6 hours to get my permit i was actually told i was a better driver than most. but i have this issue where i'm terrified of what others will think of me if i fuck up. something small like doing a shitty job when i change lanes or something scares me into not wanting to drive at all bc i don't want anyone to think less of me. i know that's stupid and not a reason i shouldn't drive but that fear consumes me in my everyday life. 
i promised my dad i'd start driving after the new year, and i plan to uphold that, maybe it's just a hump i have to get over. we'll see. but with getting my license in 6 months, that also means that i gotta be able to pay for gas money. which means i have to get a job. 
so i've tried to get a job before. quit after the first day. i didn't like my position, the place itself, or the people. it was a general store that sold sandwiches and drinks and stuff like that. i was the cashier, and being a quiet person that didn't work for me. the owner kind of humiliated me by making me repeatedly use the intercom system to call out peoples sandwich orders, saying i'm âtoo quietâ and yeah, correct me once and i'll fix it, no big deal, but don't make me do it over and over, that just put me down. and then my friend who works there told me a few days later how the owners and some of the employees were making fun of me about how i was quiet and that i wasn't saying thank you to the customers for their business. like yeah, i'm sorry i didn't do that, that's my fault, but it was my first day, i was stressed the fuck out, cut me some slack. the owners also scared me away with their whole âyou have to uphold this expectation to the customers because our store has been here for over 75 yearsâ, and yes i would expect your worker to be nice to customers and have good hospitality but don't throw that at me and say that. it just scared me and turned me away. 
long story short, my first job experience kind of was crap and it made me not want to do it anymore. i don't want people to criticize me or look at me in a negative way. it just put a bad taste in my mouth. 
so driving and getting a job are my struggles right now, but i have to do them i guess, im just terrified for reasons that i shouldn't be worried about. but i don't know how to get over my fears.",2

"Every time I type something up here I think of all the times I've been psychologically tortured by ""friends"" and just people online to the point of it being more harmful than my own mental illnesses that I get scared.

Tonight I'm not scared.

It's been tough since November. TLDR: A friend of mine rapidly fell ill and has cancer - three tumors in his kidney which is the primary cancer and two tumors in his brain. Anyone who's familiar with stage 4 brain cancer knows how this ends. Best friend of 15 years cut off from me after I admitted to them I was diagnosed last week with Aspergers. Same friend has had my back through my mental health issues (bipolar, several anxiety disorders, anorexia, alcoholism) and somehow bails for autism?

I thought I couldn't feel lower until I was the one hearing about a NYE party I wasn't invited to by my other friend. Three friends and two are treating me like shit (or I'm over analysing, I don't know) and one's dying. I've been too sick with walking pneumonia to be able to see them in hospital.

I don't know what to do. I've been emotionally blunted/numb since August (physical inability to cry) as well as skills from years of CBT, DBT and CPT aren't really doing much. I feel like shit. I was the only one online on PSN tonight, the only one playing WoW and I can't focus on Netflix. I feel like a fucking loser and wonder why I'm always alone. It's not JUST because I'm sober, people still can hang out without drinking, but every year I'm alone. I was alone on Christmas. I was alone on Thanksgiving. I can't go out to Tim Hortons (my usual place to be to write and journal) because it's -37C and that's just not happening.

I don't know what the hell I want out of posting here, I've just found myself at this sub reddit more and more and I guess tonight I needed to get this off of my chest. Lord knows if I do it on FB someone will call the police again for a wellness check (despite knowing I 1) have a safety plan with my therapist I see weekly and 2) have been known IN THE PAST to get myself to the psych ER when I'm feeling low enough) or accuse me of drama or something else.

I don't know. Fuck the holidays, fuck new years and I wish I had friends who cared. Everyone I've ever tried to meet online or in any of my games either turned out to be transphobic, homophobic and absolutely psychotic the second I refused their advances. I just want fucking conversation where someone's end game isn't to get laid (I'm asexual so good luck bruh) or treat me like a piece of shit.",3

I have been having some things happen to me which I think might be related to depression. The only thing is that I am not sad and don't have self confidence problems either, but have some other things which sound like depression.

I have noticed or been told things about myself recently that I don't feel are consistent with me in the past. My feelings are dulled, I talk in somewhat of a monotone (people tell me, I can't hear it), and sometimes I don't make any facial expressions so people think that I don't like them when I really do. Often I will be in a social environment and people will say my name to pull me out of a kind of thoughtless trance where I stare off into the distance with a blank mind, I never remember it starting, just being pulled out of it by someone else. I sometimes get asked if I am high when I am stone cold sober.

I have also been having some weird thoughts, like to jump off of a balcony to my death, or violent ones like to stab someone with a knife I am holding or to crash my car on purpose. (I don't want to do either of these things, I will just get a thought like âdo it, stab them in the neckâ or something) I would like to emphasize that I am not suicidal or even unhappy at all. Sometimes I look in the mirror and something looks off about me that I can't put my finger on, I look like someone else. Also different people often ask me âare you ok?â This bugs me because I am always ok, do I have a weird look on my face or something? I never hear them ask other people that, what is wrong with me, it makes me think that I am mentally challenged or something and everyone has been told except for me. There might be more stuff but I can't remember.

All of this stuff has happened in the past year, maybe because of stress? I am a 19 year old male, moved away to college this year so big life change but these things were happening before then also. Help/suggestions much appreciated.


TLDR: I think something is changed with me

"First off, this is just gunna b some shitty attention seeking rant thats barely gunna make any grammatical sense so feel free to leave now and just go read something more interesting I just need to get this off my chest.

Basically im a useless, lazy, attention seeking, selfish person who literally deserves nothing even though I get so much shit for free from my parents which just makes me feel bad cos they are wasting so much time and effort into a boring, nothing person. Nearly the whole of the time I am awake is just spent thinking about how I wasted everybody else's time just doing some stupid shit that they could have spent doing something to benefit them but instead they have to sit through my shit which doesn't help anybody at all. I also started cutting my self about a week ago, nobody knows yet and I have no idea why I'm doing it when I think about it I realise I'm just cutting for fucking attention again which just makes me feel like a shitty person. My whole life is paradox, pointless and goes on for ever all I can think about is how much of an attention seeker I am which makes me depressed then I think that I'm just putting on this sadness for attention which makes me think that I'm an attention seeker again and the only way to break thing fucking endless cycle is to fucking die. Every so often I go out to walk my parents dog and because of where we live I have to walk along this busy road with the traffic coming up behind me and every single time I hear a car part of me just hopes one will just smash into me, ending it all. I'm too much of a pussy to commit suicide on purpose and that will be selfish to everyone I know anyway so I wish there was just a way to just disappear as if I had never even been alive in the first place. Another thing is that I literally have 0 hope for the future, I'm 15 now and going through my GCSEs, but my grades aren't even a problem all my expected grades are above average and fine but every single other thing that is just a complete failure I have no idea how to get a job I have no idea how fucking do anything at home except for sit on my ass and play fucking videogames I have no idea how to be sociable and make friends I have never had a fucking girlfriend and I just realised I contradicted myself with the selfishness and the girlfriend wasting time and now I'm thinking in that same fucking paradox and my life is just turning to shit. Its as if I'm being pushed closer and closer to my inevitable death and it started slow at first but I'm being pushed faster and faster towards it in the past month. Idc if nobody reads this I just have to get this off my chest which I have no idea why this shitty rant would help with anything and fuck I'm just gunna post it.

So,

It doesn't correlate to events in my life, 

or to my ""actual"" feelings, 

or to my physical health. 

So why did I get cripplingly depressed all of a sudden? 

The brief period where I was exposed to just a little too much lead as a kid? When I fell on my head and got a crack in my skull at age 2? My parents don't eat that healthy and I didn't start eating right until my teens. I have psoriasis so technically I have an inflammatory disease. Is it one of these things?? What went wrong for me to be otherwise so successful, but suddenly want to die? 

Why does no one know what causes depression???????

"Hi guys,
Never even used reddit before but a close friend of mine suggested asking for help on one of these to keep anonymous.

Recently I've finished school and turned 18 (adulthood in Australia). For about 12 months now I've had massively interrupted sleeping schedules, and my body is used to only getting 4-5 hours sleep, sometimes able to function on 2-3.
In the last 4 weeks, my thoughts tend to become darker, I feel the sensation of suffocation and drowning (I'm crying as I type this..)

I hate the thought of professional help (counsellors/therapists) but I may consider it soon. I have a loving yet dysfunctional family, 2 brothers and loving parents. I live in a good home and have a part time job as a cashier in a supermarket that I've stuck to for 2 years. I'm waiting on university offers and if I'm lucky I'll be moving states to Melbourne City in Victoria for something along the lines of Law/Business.
I can't shake these awful feelings, my brain feels continuously sick. Recently I've been experiencing alot of anxiety, something I've never ever felt before, usually I am confident and outgoing. Very recently, my job has made me feel extremely anxious and sometimes I hyperventilate if I'm lacking sleep and feel like I'm sinking even lower... its 3:10am on New Years Day as I write this.

I don't know how I feel about disclosing what I think triggered this depression, but I will say I received an unexpected diagnosis after collapsing during work about 3-4 weeks ago. It's been downhill ever since.

Please help, happy to answer any more questions, and sorry if I've broken any rules; I'm new to reddit.",3

I am no stranger to depression my self but am having a lot of current difficulties with helping my wife through hers. As I'm sure your all know what works for one person may not work for the next. Nor is it easy to know exactly what will help the best, especially when the depression hinders the sufferer from understanding their own needs, being able to express them and sometimes even not being able to accept the help even if it is exactly what they were asking for.

The feeling doesn't even stay, I make someone cry, then apologize for it because I start to understand what I'm doing, and then the next day I'm confused why I apologized, and rinse and repeat. 


The only time I feel somewhat normal is after being angry and making someone cry, because afterwards, I just can't think, my head is empty, and, it's somewhat peaceful, I don't know

"I've never opened up before like this before so please forgive the incoming wall of text

My girlfriend broke up with me a couple of months ago. We're still friends, but I can't stop thinking about her and regretting letting it happen. She is what I think about most of the day, and I am on the verge of coming back crying to her asking her to forgive me and give me another chance. She was the only one that cared about me, that didn't put me down. Even though I had many failings she still said she loved me, even after my best friend's put me down for being dumb. She was the only one that treated me as an equal and not a second rate citizen to be laughed at or to be disappointed with. 

I started uni this year. I've had fun but made close to no friends and it feels really superficial. I don't know if I like it but there's no way I can go back now, my parents will fucking disown me even if I try, even though I'm at a second rate uni wasting my time. The people I talk to most are still my friends from school and my now ex. I cry myself to sleep most nights. I am never happy. I tried getting help from my email by applying for councilling but they took a month to reply and when I turned up there was no one there. 

I am so lonely. I have no more will to continue. I can't end it but if I could I would. The weather makes me feel like shit. The success of all my friends compared to how much of a fucking FAILURE I am makes me feel like shit. I have no one to turn to. Most nights I can't even sleep and when I do only for a few hours at a time. I will do shit in my exams. I still go through life but I feel like an empty vessel. My parents are disappointed in me. My younger sister makes fun of me. People avoid me.

I try to be an interesting person and someone to invite to parties but it just seems whatever I do people reject me. I just want this to end. I want to be happy and live life. This is meant to be the best time of my life, so why is the best thing in my life the fact that I got a decent amount of karma on a post on my main? How fucking pathetic do I have to be to actually be proud of that?

When I went back later that evening my baby brother told me that the doctor only gave him two months at most. Apparently my dad had known that he had cancer for months and just chose not to tell anyone. So we all make arrangements to bring him home and have hospice help look after him until he passed. So we got him home on the 20th and me too my two brothers and my sister in law spent the night at his house. I slept in the floor beside the hospital bed in case he needed anything during the night.

"I've been having lucid dreams due to the side effects of my meds and I'm finding it hard to cope with them. I talked to my doctor and he told me to try taking them in the morning instead of at night but that hasn't really helped.

In fact, they made things worse as I woke up right after from a nightmare and I found myself grabbing onto the bedsheets like I was grabbing onto something from my dream. I don't remember what it was but it was the first and last time I took them.

Going to sleep is no longer the comfort it once was. Even though I get plenty of sleep I wake up feeling mentally drained, and because these lucid dreams make it seems like I was awake and dealing with real life situations that tend to be stressful and unpleasant it's like I wasn't really asleep. Physically I'm well rested but mentally I'm not.

Then when I really wake up it takes me a minute to actually realize it was all just a dream and it's messed up.

"Hi everyone.  
This is a throw away.  
I don't know if I have the right to say I'm depressed because I mostly think that I'm making it up in my head.  
There are some times when I'm fine but then I get really sad moment every 2 weeks and every 2 or 3 months everything becomes really dark and I just stay in bed for days. Sometimes I think of killing myself a lot, I really dream of doing it, sometimes I plan it, but I never did anything close to it. Just self harm or eating to the point where it hurts, sex addiction, drinking, smoking.  
I never was in a relationship, no man ever said they loved me until I was 26 years old. I had given up on it by then and I had decided to write all my goodbye letters and go on a trip to NZ and die there.  
But then I met a guy I really liked spending time with, and he told me he loved me, I couldn't believe it but after a while I felt it too, or let myself feel it too, and we've been dating since. After that for the first time in 10 years I felt quite good and took up new hobbies and was seeing a future for myself. All this time I still felt that there's something wrong with him for loving me, but I was able to enjoy it while it lasted.  
We're still together now, but I want to leave him. He didn't do anything wrong and he is still great but I feel like I'm a weight and just the worst person to have feelings for. I don't understand his love. He is blinded by I don't know what. What can I add to his life? Absolutely nothing. Just negative things. I want to sabotage this whole thing or ghost him.  
I'm really lost because in the past I have been able to see what I was unsatisfied by in our relationship, he has also brought up some things I was doing badly and all these things have been talked through and worked on and corrected. But now I just want to be alone and stop suffering, the fact that I'm weighing him down is just another thing making me sad. I want to be cold to him so that he finally leaves.  
He is trying to be supportive but I don't want to ask for his help anymore. When his presence doesn't help, both of us just feel worse. And I don't think another person can fix/heal me so it's pointless.  
  
Sorry for this long rant. I guess I was just hoping to see if anyone has ever felt this before?

"I used to try to talk to people about my depression, and tell them how I felt. In the end it only pushed people alway. No one wants to hear about your depression and the things you go through that suck. All they want to hear about is how successful you are, the jokes you have to tell, in general, the positives you can add to their lives. If you think you've found something different I promise you, you haven't, you're just missing whatever that other person is getting out of you. 
As shitty as this sounds, once you know this, you can rearrange your behavior to reflect how people really feel. Why try and talk about your depression with someone? In the end you're really just bringing them down. It's better to focus on something positive or if you can't just make some space and don't talk about anything at all. The people people love to be around are ""always in a good mood"" or ""always down to have a good time"". Chances are these people have issues as well they probably just handle them better. They know that no one really cares about their problems, and people just want someone they can have fun with so they play them game. And when these people can't play the game anymore they spend sometime alone. Sure, maybe some people are just naturally happier than others but that doesn't mean that even naturally unhappy people can't use the same strategy. They might just have to spend more time by themselves. 

Ultimately my New Years resolution is to keep more of myself to myself, to be more positive around others even if I don't feel it within myself and most importantly, to take that time to myself to know when I can't put on the face anymore. ",5

2.) Shitty in-laws. It's VERY bad. Spent almost a decade patiently convincing my SO that they hate him. Because they do.

(Either I keep trying to convince him to stop feeling obligated for people who mistreat him ..or I leave.)

3.) Poverty level.

(Randomly succeed at life and afford to live WOW SO EASY AMIRITE. My solution is to keep leaving below my means. Start gambling safely and see what extra money I can come up with.)

4.) No dependable friends. I talk to people easily. Most suck. Most enjoy suffering and pity points. I want people around me where we all want to SOLVE our depression/etc.

(Keep trying to establish long-term friendship with people. It's basically endless, time-consuming shopping that we all have to do.)

I've been depressed for about 20 years now. I'm pretty good at distracting myself and finding happiness in the tiniest things. But damn, the past two years are really grinding to a halt.",5

"So that I could see exactly why I'm so repulsive.

I have no idea what it is. I used to just tell myself it's because I'm not super attractive but now I'm getting paranoid I drive people away with some shitty aura that is completely out of my control. This is arguably worse because at least I can work on my physical appearance to a degree.

I try so hard to be there for people, try to be a good friend, etc. But eventually everyone just drops me anyway.

I can't be myself around people because who I really am is a depressed, negative, pessimistic, hopeless, self loathing piece of shit. I can't help it, this is what you become when life and people shit all over you for years on end. So I try to be more positive, but I have to fake it because I'm naturally a depressing downer.

I don't know what it is but people don't seem to ever want to stick around in my life. It seems like everyone just eventually vanishes into thin air and stops talking to me all of a sudden. This goes for relationships but it also applies to some friendships that I mistakenly believed were very close. People don't like the real me but they don't seem to like the fake me either so I have no idea what to do with myself.",4
"I mean I see it as weak as a man standpoint but it's comforting when it can put you to sleep getting all your emotions out and I constantly do it for the comfort I can never get from anybody else.  It's nice and puts you to ease but it seems so pathetic but I can't stop myself from doing it, I need comfort and I need self reinsurance that I'll be okay and comforted. Is this really pathetic? I don't think of it as a personal stand point but from self judge and trying to be generally not so weak. ",4
"It's 4:18 AM as I'm typing this, and I can't sleep. It always takes me a long time to fall asleep, but I couldn't stop thinking and stressing about going back to work after the holidays. Before I knew it, I was about to break down and hyperventilate or cry. I didn't want to wake up my fiancÃ©e, so I got up and I'm now sitting in the livingroom. I'm sorry for whining when I know other people have it much worse than I do, but I need to vent.

I'm almost 30 years old, the son of the owner of a local business in a small town located in QuÃ©bec, Canada. I work for his company, which deals in the sales and repair of commercial and industrial equipment. On paper, I work in sales; in reality, I do practicality everything except for repairs, including but not limited to sales, purchasing, quotations, invoicing, customer service at the counter, on the phone and online, retail item placement and management, parts and equipment research, shipping and receiving, data entry and processing, IT, webmaster, infographics and promotional materials. I also manage our team to some degree and replace the boss and our accounts receivables/payables (his girlfriend) whenever they're away, so I handle late payment complaints even though I can't do anything about it. I'm bilingual and so almost all communications in English are done through me.

That may sound like a fair bit, but I then I also do approximately 75% of one of my colleagues' work because he quite simply can't be arsed to do it. He'll act like he's super busy doing one task whereas I'm typically juggling (no joke) between 5 and 8 tasks at any time, yet I often find him playing solitaire or stretching and loudly yawning at his desk, even when customers are waiting at the counter. A couple summers ago, for two years in a row, when we were the only employees in front, he literally spent hours sleeping at his desk while I alone held the fort throughout our busy seasons. He's approaching retirement age and has been involved with the family for decades; he's not going anywhere.

The foreman in charge of managing repairs and our crew of mechanics routinely vanishes, either going out for errands that take a suspicious amount of time to run, going upstairs to do work for his own company on our dime, spending half an hour in the washroom (upstairs for some reason), running home for one reason or another, or just plain nowhere to be found for no known reason. He fails to properly submit quotations to most customers and fails to properly fill out repair files, so we have to inform customers and make out invoices at the counter when they come in. He also gets me to find parts and pricing as well as place orders for him because he seemingly doesn't feel like doing that himself, maybe because that would cut into his Facebook time. He's typically 15-30 minutes late each morning and afternoon, but he takes off at closing time on the dot, if not a few minutes early. I think it's fair to say that I effectively do about half of his job for him. He's family and is seemingly unfireable for some reason, despite the fact that he's hurting the company badly.

I'll admit I'm usually about 5 minutes late in the morning; I barely get any sleep and never feel rested from any sleep I do get, so it takes a lot of time and motivation to get up and going. That doesn't make it right and I'm ashamed of this bad habit, but I work an extra hour or two everyday, unpaid. I get paid 40 hours a week, but typically work about 50 hours a week. I get reprimanded for being late and for being sick, but unpaid hours go unmentioned. I don't have any fancy diplomas, but I don't think I'd be exaggerating if I said I was a hard worker, maybe even a workaholic.

My father's family is pretty well known locally and is fairly affluent, so customers tend to assume that I'm well off, but they couldn't be further from the truth. I get paid a few dollars more than minimum wage and that's it; no benefits, no commission, no overtime pay, no extra vacation days and no share of the company's profits. I make just enough for my fiancÃ©e and I to survive and afford necessities, and that's about it. Last winter, I couldn't even afford heating, so I had to borrow money to buy fuel oil. Meanwhile, two of my cousins had their houses custom built, one of them spends half his time on vacation with his family and the other's heading to Las Vegas soon, and my other cousin doesn't work but has all her expenditures and house paid for by her dad.

If I dare to complain about my financial difficulties, I get talked down to by my father and his girlfriend and told that I should save up (what is this concept of having leftover money at the end of the month???). They say that my fiancÃ©e should find work, but they don't pay her for the work she does for them. She's a self-employed web designer, artist and programmer; unfortunately, times are tough in that line of business here. She has however done thousands of dollars worth of unpaid work for them, including 3-4 professional websites, and continues to assist them. Any amount she makes goes straight to paying off our debts (credit card) or contributes to paying our expenditures.

My father wants me to buy the business from him so that he has a retirement fund that allows him to keep up his current lifestyle, which includes going on vacation abroad 4-5 times a year, not including camping trips in his RV. However, he refuses to do anything about the obvious issues currently going on and refuses to adapt to the changing market. Suggestions always get turned down and he resists any improvements that I and my only helpful colleague attempt to make. I also routinely have to put up with my father's infantile tantrums and the fact that he doesn't trust me to do anything, resorting to ""micromanaging"". Recently, he doubted my ability to read a PDF in front of a supplier, which was embarassing, and couldn't let me compare invoices (that he asked me to compare) and tried to take over my computer while I was using it so he'd show me how to do my job. It's an extremely stressful work environment, but it's also the way my father has always been with me, and I'm fairly sure that's played a large part in the fact that I have no self-confidence and can't connect with people.

The end result of all the above is that I come home late everyday, exhausted both physically and especially mentally. I barely get any real sleep, my stomach frequently gives me trouble and I suspect that's due to stress, and every little thing feels like a huge challenge. I'm under massive stress because I know very well that if any emergency occurs, if anything breaks or worse, I'm completely unable to afford to solve the issue. Instead, I have to rely on the pity of others, typically my father's if he feels like it (with a healthy dose of acting like he's being generous instead of paying me according to my work), and live with the shame of it. I've always had an exceptional patience with people, but lately the stress has been building up and I've begun snapping at people, worst of all my loving and supportive fiancÃ©e without whom I wouldn't even be around right now.

I've been depressive for over 15 years now and coping with it, but I think this is my lowest point yet. The last week before the holidays, I stood alone in the shipping area and slowly dug a box cutter knife into my left wrist. I was, quite literally, an inch away from ending my life, but it barely left a mark and looks like a skin fold now. I don't want to leave my fiancÃ©e and our cats though, and I especially don't want them to end up in financial trouble. I have a life insurance, but the payout is minimal and they wouldn't cover suicide before at least another year and a half.

I'm going back to work on Monday, less than a week from now. At this point, I only see a few ways out...

- Winning the lottery: Essentially a miracle, but also our only hope of fulfilling any dreams or projects.

- Leaving: Taking a massive risk and leaving my current job, hopefully to work from home online, possibly burning bridges with a family that I do care for despite it all, but also possibly losing everything.

- Staying: Try to last another year and a half in this situation and then examine my options, possibly a rope.

It's now 7:06 AM as I'm typing this on my phone, still sitting in the livingroom. I've stopped panicking and am shaking instead. If you've read this whole thing, I feel sorry for taking that time away from your life and for whining so much, but I'm also thankful that you cared enough to finish. I'm not looking for a solution, I simply needed to vent.

I've come to say that you all can do it, everyone of you can achieve and be something greater. It may seem like it's impossible for some, but life is a hard, hard road. You don't have to be depressed to know life is quite the bitch and throws you around all the time. But having the strength to keep going and fighting for yourself is what keeps us all here. The fact all of you are here is a miracle in itself, and while many people  may see it as more of a curse than a blessing, just know that life has strange ways of working, and everyone here has the ability to live up to what they want to be

It may not seem like it right now, hell it may not feel like it a few years from now, but just always know that your life is important, you matter, to all of us, but more importantly, you matter to yourself.

"I don't enjoy the ""nice"" things other people seem to enjoy. Whenever I hear people treating themselves to nice things - a nice meal, a nice drink, a nice bubble bath, a nice warm bed, a nice movie, a nice fuzzy or otherwise comfortable garment, a nice place to be or visit - all I can think to myself is ""How miserable it must be to enjoy those things alone. I could do any one of those things right now, but it wouldn't make me feel better. It would make me feel worse for trying to 'take care of' myself like I'm some wounded baby that needs nursing.""

I've been having panic attacks every day, feeling depressed all the time because I feel like no matter how hard I try, I'm going to fail and disappoint everyone, I'll never get a good job and people will think I'm a layabout.

"6 months ago, my girlfriend of 2 years ended our relationship by cheating on, followed by moving out with all of our stuff (gave away my bed and furniture so she could move hers in), and a bunch of other really low stuff, saying she never even loved me and was leading me on. It's been 6 months but feels like it be end a week, literally. I get little memories of us talking about something that actually feels like it was last week, they feel so clear. I've never been depressed, never been in a relationship. After she broke up with me, I realized how pointless my life now is. I was working 10 hours days 6 days a week so I could support us. I was working for us, we were talking about getting married. It was a bit early but we were set on having kids. The thought of having a kid and family to take care of motivated me so much. And now that I don't have that I feel so pointless. It caused a lot of philosophical questioning in my head about life, and I don't even wanna be alive at most times. Some days I feel so positive, some days I think about jumping off of a bridge. It's been 6 lonely months, without a job, now living at my dad's while he's constantly pestering me about getting a job. I've posted on here so many times and people keep telling me just to move on and hangout with friends but it's not that fuckin easy. I have 0 motivation to do anything and I feel so pathetic. You would think that if I'm gonna be alive I should at least do something with my life even if I wanna die, but I don't. I just sit here and listen to music all day. I have dreams but they feel so impossible that I don't even try. I don't even think anybody is gonna read this far. ",4
"I always enjoy having non serious debates with people because it is a good way to understand how people think.

We decided to just end it because it was going no where. I later said (texted), ""we should continue tomorrow, it was fun."" I still had things to say but just wanted to come off as fun and light-hearted so that this debate will go on. She started attacking the way I'm acting and my personality ( which was related to the argument ) and said I started getting angry when she started aggressively texted me. She has a tendency to purposely anger me many times, however sometimes she takes it too far and doesn't realizes. I even told her after that I didn't like when she did it but she still acted like a sarcastic asshole to me. It just made me really angry and annoyed and I just feel like punching something or inflict pain on myself to feel better. 4Am I overreacting?

"Hi, 
do any of you have practical advice and methods on how to overcome fear? There are some things I have to do which, when I try to start them, cause me to have this intense freezing fear.  In my case it can be opening various mail or even starting to read some book. It could even be when I decide to rent a movie. I know I shouldn't be afraid and I do not see rational reasons for it, but I get waves of fear that feel like there is a predator that is going to attack. I feel it and I am gripped with stillness and fear as if I am hiding and can't move or breathe heavily because it could reveal my position. 

Because of this I end up not doing things I have to do, missing some deadlines, not going to the dentist. Well the dentist is understandable since no one wants to go to them. In my case it is mundane things.

"My friend keeps talking about his depression, but I can't tell if he really is depressed or is just going through a rough patch in his life. He still gets out of bed to hang out with us and he just graduated college. 

But he gets very emotional when he drinks, and is either really happy or really sad. When we all hang out, as a group of guys we all make fun of each other because that's what guys do, but are careful not to push his buttons too much. He broke up with his girlfriend who he cheated on a few times, but keeps texting her wanting to get back together with her. He always wants to talk about very sad things, and doesn't ever act happy when he comes out with us.

What I don't get is if he's depressed, wouldn't it be hard for him to get out of bed? He invites us over his house to do stuff, but then just wants to talk about how sad he is and it makes me and our group of friends not want to hang out with him anymore.

I've tried to help him the most, listening to him whenever he asks me for help, inviting him out, and offering advice when he asks for it. But he never listens to me, and just blames his ""depression"" all of the time, and it's really dragging my friends down (not so much me though because I don't let his feelings affect mine, but it does get exhausting having to listen to him go on about this.)

He says he's going to a psychologist for help, but that he hates going there. He hasn't talked to his parents at all about it, and refuses to tell his older sisters either, which is surprising because he does have a very supportive family. Their family isn't the best shape financially, but it certainly isn't the worst.

I feel like he's more so upset because he compares himself and his life to others, and granted things haven't gone his way all the time, but that's normal, is it not?

Please help me, is there a way to determine if he is depressed or not? Is there a way to suggest he find help? Or is my friend just playing a game with us to get attention?",4

"This is my first time on this subreddit, so I apologize in advance if my post doesn't meet the rules. I've just been wanting to get everything off my chest for so long and this is the first place it seems like I can do that. 

A month ago I started seeing a LCSW because an HR lady at work recommended I take advantage of the EAP program after I spent an hour and a half bawling my eyes out in her office. I was there because I knew I was going to have to go back to the hospital and I didn't want to. I thought I could work from the hospital because I can't leave work for that long. I'll just get that much further behind. 

That hospital at the tail end of December was my 4th stay for the year, 3rd for a crisis. I have Myasthenia Gravis, a neuromuscular autoimmune disorder that causes weakness in my voluntary muscles. I was diagnosed at 18. I grieved. I pulled my boots on and I kept going.

Except I don't want to keep going anymore. I'm not suicidal, but the thought of having to take medicine in 3 hours and 20 minutes so I can stay ahead of the weakness makes me tired. I'm so tired. I live my life in 4 hour increments between pills. 

I'm 23 now. In the almost 5 years since I've been diagnosed, I've had 5 crisis events that I've had to be hospitalized for. 3 of those included a feeding tube. 1 of those included the flu and ICU. 

Normally I can push through and get back to routine. This time I can't. I want to cry. I am crying as I type this. I don't know what's different about this time. 

My counselor (social worker? Therapist? What's the appropriate term?) says that I'm depressed. She said that the first day she met me. She says I'm scared. She thinks I should quit my job because of my âdisability.' Or that they should at least be offering me accommodations. She says that I don't tell my husband or my family how I really feel about my Myasthenia Gravis and that I don't allow them to properly support me like I need them to. She says that I need to bring them in for a session so she can mediate and I can tell them how I really feel. 

I'm not comfortable with that. I don't know how I really feel. I don't want them to know how I really feel. I have spent 5 years protecting them from the burden that is my disease until I can't protect them or myself. My husband and my parents are the most supporting people I have ever met. My mom stays with me when I'm in the hospital. My husband does anything I ask of him, even if it includes picking me up off the floor when I'm too weak to stand by myself. But that doesn't mean I'm going to allow them to see me weak. They already see my muscles weak. I can't be emotionally weak too. 

I don't know what to do about my therapist. I don't know what I'm supposed to be accomplishing. I mostly just go in there and cry about stuff and then she tells me more about how she wants to talk to my husband and my parents. She also found out about me being a graphic designer and has asked that I do a branding campaign for her. How do you say no to someone you've only spoken with 3 times about very private matters? Now I feel like there's a line that's been crossed and it's not going to get resolved until I finish the work and stop the sessions. 

I don't think I'm doing any of this right. 

My symptoms are getting worse. I didn't know that Myathenia Gravis was progressive even with treatment. It used to just be my speech and swallowing. Now it's in my arms and legs and it's hard to breathe. I had surgery in July to hopefully help get me off some of this medication and stabilize my symptoms. I knew that the surgery could take 2 or 5 years to work. I didn't realize how hard it would be to wait. I didn't realize that I would crash. I was as close to pre-MG normal as I had ever been and I crashed. Hard. I didn't want to acknowledge that the surgery may not work.

I just want to stop crying every time I think about it. I want to stop thinking about it. It's like a broken record in my head. All day every day. Except all the record is playing is static because I don't know what I'm thinking about. Am I scared? Have I isolated myself from any help I may get? All I know is I don't want to be strong anymore. I don't want to be âyou're so courageous for dealing with this.â I don't want to be. I just want to sleep. ",3
"I am so sick of being depressed. When I was a kid, I was happy and never let anything keep me down. When there was a problem, I solved it, simple as that. Now I get depressed and contemplate suicide. I can't take it anymore; I am so sick of being disappointed in myself. I'm sick of always being too afraid to act. 

Maybe I am a failure and maybe I never will amount to anything, but how will I know if I never try or believe in myself. I will use my nihilism to succeed and be happy. This is the only life I've got, and someday I'll be dead and forgotten. So why waste it being sad. No longer will I romanticize my depression and let it get the better of me. I'm not giving in anymore.

Depression is my enemy and will defeat it. ",5
"28, Male, Denver, divorced two years ago, then got the greatest job, lots of money, just got laid off... and now I'm broke. Just applied for unemployment...
          
I grew up in a family w mental illness and some abuse, not super close to parents or siblings, or friends really... I have enough friends but... God I just feel like... so fuckin alone now. 
          
I need connection and intamacy but I have become cold and untrusting... and there's a part of me that has hope and is positive and strong - and I'm a good man, but I struggle with addiction to niccotine weed and alcohol... and depression... I'm hyper critical of myself and lazy from depression and make all these excuses... like... fuck I just want to hug myself and love myself or meet someone as cold as me and hug them because I know it... 
          
So if you're reading this - just know, you deserve to love yourself and nurture yourself. You deserve to do things that are good for you and make you happy. Know that it's okay to let someone love you, and to love them. Love just for the sake of sharing kindness with someone. Be kind to yourself. It isn't easy for anyone to be human and this world should have more love in it.

"I'm not talking about our misconstrued constructs about what's morally acceptable. I'm talking about the hypocrisy and the pretentiousness, the megalomania that grips each and every person. I mean, everyone is so full of shit. We pretend to care about others, and want others to care about us, but it's not because we actually care. It's because we're the only thing that matters. As soon as it becomes convenient, we throw others to the side. So long as we can get our chemical fix, we'll slave away until the day we die, spouting bullshit and pretending as if things actually matter. Hell, we even have the ego to assume we have some kind of superiority over other living creatures. Are we not animals? Sorry, but just because we are subjectively more intelligent, doesn't mean our existence is any less futile or has any more meaning. Sorry to break it to you, but God's not real, and why would you even want him to be? (i may be inserting my preconceived notions as fact, but in theme with this post, Idgaf if you disagree) 
     On this subreddit, we all pretend to sympathize with each other, but I bet in real life we are all judgemental sacks of shit, and I'm willing to bet that because I know I certainly am. I like to spout about the woes of man, but in real life, I'm a slave to the emotional parts of my brain, an introvert with no social skills, humor, or personality. I don't explain this for pity btw, I explain this because I'm quite the hypocrite, and I'm willing to bet you are too. People who complain about gender inequality annoy me. People who complain about racial inequality annoy me. I'm a selfish prick, sure. But so are you. So stop forcing me to pretend to care about you? I have my own worthless ideals that I care about, and that you don't. For example, I think there is a ridiculous age inequality. For what reason should age be used as an indicator of expected respect? If you're a fucking idiot, and don't cater to my selfish wants, I'm not going to fucking respect you. I might be *age* and a know it all, but that doesn't guarantee I don't fucking know more than you. Even if I don't, everyone shouldn't just assume I don't and treat me like a fucking child, but then expect me to act like an adult. Are you fucking kidding me with the hypocrisy?
Oh, but even though you don't take my issue seriously, I should take racism seriously because it affects you personally and you would like to feed your ego.

"If you're anything like me you like to see videos on youtube on depression and mental illness and stuff to get answers. A thing that gets mentioned a lot in these videos and by people around you is that ""everything will be fine"". However I think this is a wrong message. When you say ""everything will be fine"" it sounds like everything will automatically fall into place. But it's not going to automatically fall into place. Depression is a like a pit that always gets deeper and if you don't start climbing it will be harder and harder to climb out. You won't automatically get out of depression. You have to work for it, search for long term and short term goals that are possible for you (a therapist can help with this really well). Don't just wait for depression to end because it's just going to get worse. Latch on to the pit and start climbing, that is the only way.",0

"Had a session with my therapist before the beginning of New Year's Eve. I was trying to explain to her my greatest fear. The fear of never being understood. I was diagnosed with depression in year of 2011. Since then I have sought out treatment in the form of talk therapy and medication. And in all this time, even before I was educated about my ""illness"", not once has anyone I've come into contact with been able to see the world with my eyes. Yet I can be so understanding and kind and caring and able to walk in the shoes of others. I want to make others smile, be happy, and laugh. It's why I'm reading, studying, and practicing to become an actor. But I can no longer hide behind this mask of false images and hopes that ""things will get better"". How is it I can live a solid twenty four years on this planet, down to the exact seconds from which I was born today, being part of a sociable species of animals dubbed humans and still not have a genuine connection with a single person? How? Bar forced seclusion and isolation practices, it should not be possible. I should not be possible. Yet I persist and endure and struggle to live as a thing. A creature. A human not worth the very effort it took to create and make this pathetic existence I call life something worth living. My therapist heard a similar story to what I have just written from me, (minus the whole being alive for a full twenty four years part), and it sounded like she was trying to contemplate an answer to justify my thinking as being a product of my depression. By this time tears were sliding down my face one drop at a time. Yet I felt as stern as an emotionless being. Then she said something that caught me off guard in a voice as sad and as hurt as a mother pleading for the safety of her child. She said, ""please don't hurt yourself"". The thing is, I can't understand if she was crying for me or for what I had just said being reflected off my face. And even if she was starting to cry......., why? Why cry for someone who has no place in society. Why cry for someone who cannot be fathomed by his peers or parents? Why cry at all for this hollow wound of a human she saw before her? Just why?",5
"So I have been in depression for almost more than 2 years now. At the start of the those 2 years, I quit my job and literally spent 2 years sitting at home. 

Now I want to get back to life. However there is a constant thinking in my head that I am a loser. and that I have not achieved anything in life. which makes me wonder what should I do now. 

All I see is the darkness. I have started to believe that I need to get out of depression first before thinking anything about the career. Is that approach okay ???. If yes then can someone please guide me how to move forward ? 
I have already expressed myself on this subreddit the past week and the replies i got were encouraging. However I now think that there is a phase or gap between the mind filled with depressive thoughts and the optimistic mind looking for something for the career. I am 27 and will be 28 in 7 months and I want to transition from the former to the latter as soon as possible. can someone help me with that ?

"HI there everyone. This is extremly long, I want to finally ~wake up~ , so, if you don't have free time, don't read. Sorry If I let my emotions to take over my writing.

 This is the first time I open myself like this, to a bigger community or a larger group. First of all, I'm 15, young, ain't I. I don't think age matters, anyway. My life so far was and is pretty rought. My mother died when I was 7, because of cancer. Even though I was young, I wasn't stupid. I knew what happen when I was called at my school ~office~ or whatever it is called to be told. 

One of my friends mom adopted us. By us, I mean my brother and my sister. She is one of the best and most powerfull pearsons I know. She already had a daughter and was divorced. We had to move, 2 times, because of some issues with the rent. She and fought and is fighting, in a way or another for us. She is the reason why me and my sister have a roof above our heads right now. She took a part of an old building, raised it from nothing, without anyone helping her, just a women, alone. She renovated and âupgradedâ the interior of the house. 

Years and years later, my brother left us. Just because he's ~different~ and has another sexual orientation discussion starter to occur. He left, found someone who he loves, and, lives happily, in a way or another. I'm happy that he found his way, but I could never understand why he left.

I was a pretty mediocre and am, talentless and a bother. My way of being it's like, helping the others, and disappearing. After I know the pearson is good, I want to fade, but I can't, because they attach.

My stepmother family is pretty fucked up in the head. One has drinking problems, and her mother and her sister. Oh god, they are the worst. None shows their real face, only after a while, that's one leason I learned after so many years. We had our updown in family, but everything is their fault, for jabing into our lives.

Here, in my country, and in my city, the salary isn't worth anything. That's why she went in another country, actually found someone, found the PERFECT job for her, but, with that the problems came.

Since she is far and her job can't allow it, she can come two or three times home. I don't have a problem with it, I know how much she was struggeling with this dumb life in this country, and I'm happy she can finally start her life, it's never late.

But I'm alone, with my sister. She's an adult, she can take care of me, that's not the problem here. She had some job problems, was thrown out, and because of that, money issues came in. Money, after money, after money. That isn't such a big issue, or that's what anyone would think. Apparently it is, in this dammed family, they are all judging, throwing her, disrespecting her and ~spitting~ on her.

She was on the merge of suicide so many times, but she can't do such thing, because I'm still in her life. She still fights for me, otherwise she would be gone a long time ago. Since we went throught a lot, we aren't the type to show our affection, our love, and like all the people, make mistakes. We love our stepmother, she did what many can't do, but we feel like we are thrash, and want to die, both of us.

Since my stepmother is far, and I don't know why this is happening, she can't control her life alone, not anymore. She let's other pearsons, like her mom, and the idiot that she found, but unfourtunately loves, dig in, they are making the decision for her, and that hurts. We love her, but we are being constantly ~stabbed~, because of her blindness.

Whatever we say is put against us, we are being gossiped by them, thrown on the window, disrespected, literally thrashed by her family. That hurts, and I'm on the merge of totally giving up. We've been fighting, resisting, but it hurts like hell.

My sister found her love, but, because of the fact that he is a gypsy, they all judge her. She doesn't know what to do anymore, in order to reconcile both sides, she can't do anything, because nothing is enough or good for them, they are a bunch of incompetents. Judging her over and over, when that men helped us more than they did. That's just stupidity. 

We've been hurt, over and over. Now I understand why our brother left, because of this family.

After I grew up, I found myself in a depression. An extremely severe one. I can't get out, I found amazing people but, because of the doings of my own hands, I lost them. I lost a her that she helped me for an entire year, because I'm a liar and lazy pearson. I want help but I don't want them to get in, because they will feel bad, my situation will completely ruin their happiness. So I found myself sad, depressed, talentless. The only things I have left are my dogs, which I love the most on this planet. From three, I was left with two, and god knows when, with one. I feel like the power I have left is with my dogs, but, when they will be gone same I will. I want to disappear, completely. That was I will end my suffering and make this family realize what the hell they did wrong the whole time. My stepmother is great, did amazing things, but one thing she didn't gave us was love and affection.

I'm spending nights playing, school isn't going that great, I have another way of thinking and I really don't bother with it. I just, can't. Playing and spending my days on PC, even though I don't want to. I want to have a talent, to grow up and save everyone that in my situation, to grow up as an artist, singer, anything. I just want a talent.

I drew a long time ago, lost my talent because of the lack of motivation and depression. Started guitar alone, but don't have the motivation because I feel like I'm a failure. 

A long story, and I'm thanking you all who reached this part, you are amazing just by spending time reading. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I'm depressed, I'm thinking of things a 15 shouldn't, thinking of suicide nowadays, because of the situation we are in, thinking so much, being dead inside and having a huge gap in my hearth because of the things I lost so far, and because I can't do anything proper.

I need help, what should I do in order to change myself, I'm just at the begging of life and thinking of ending it. I hate this world and everything around it, because I was raised with hatred and ~fights~. I want help, to cure my deep depression, to regain my happiness, to see the world colorfull again, I want to be normal, again. What can I do, nothing motivates me and nothing makes me happy anymore.

"This is quite difficult to talk about with people I know, or therapists for that matter, so I'm hoping this platform of strangers will make things easier...

I've had these thoughts for roughly 5-years now, with the exception of a 4-month stretch, when I felt happy (literally for the first and only time). 

The thought of killing myself is not only terrifying, I know that it's wrong (in every sense of the word). I'd never want to put my family through that, nor myself; however, I can't help but fantasize about the idea of some freak accident occurring to put me out of this misery.  

My struggles with my happiness stem from a very young age, and things simply have not gotten better. The 4-month stretch was beyond surreal. It was when I realized I had never been happy before, and unfortunately not since. 

The idea of some freak accident ending my life is so appealing; it would end my depressing thoughts and feelings, would take the guilt off of my hands (instead of doing it myself), and while it would still be crushing to my family, it wouldn't have the added drama of ""what could we have done to help?"" The idea of living life for another ~50-years with the absence of happiness truly sounds awful, not worth it in the slightest.

Hello,

I'm sorry I don't speak *my language* well, so i'm writing this in English. My name is --------- ------, but you can just call me ----. I'm 18 years old and I am ---- ------, I was born and raised here in -------. I'm just a student at an international school really. Things aren't working well, they've never worked well. For years and years of my life I've lived with thoughts of falling to my death, drowning in my own blood. Years and years of depression that was neglected. And now it has come to the point where I no longer am stable, I can't bear it. I am in so much pain. I hear voices sometimes, they tell me to kill myself and they laugh at me. The depression became so much more worse, with constant thoughts of dying, my meaning of life being nothing, everything equaling up to nothing. I have lived with an abusive father my own life and my mother, grandparents, sisters, relatives, and even myself have acted like nothing has happened for so many years. It was years of being traumatized that I didn't realize had affected me so bad. This morning, I didn't want to join him for an appointment as it would be expensive for both of us and he should only do his checkup for now. I had talked to my father in a calm voice, using ""please"" and ""I would really not like to"". He then proceeds to shout at the top of his lungs as if he were a lion, it is quite a shocking and traumatizing roar. Then he proceeds to punch me until I fall to the floor and he kicks me and punches me while I am in a fetal position. He then got a big jug of water to dump on my face which I was choking on because I was already screaming for help and choking on my words before that. I lay on the floor crying and screaming and begging anyone to help me. I live on the 18th floor of my condo so no one could. I tried to though. He physically abuses me often, and after it he cries and begs me for forgiveness. I cannot take it anymore. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my younger sister whom I love so dearly. I think I've lost my sanity at this point, I have no hesitation to harm myself and I leave the house at 3am and go for long walks and come at 7 or 8 am. That I've stopped just for my mother because it frightens her. She as well who keeps accusing me of being a whore because I go out on my own all the time and where clothing that shows off cleavage and also have a curvy figure.(I have large breasts so it's hard to find a shirt that isn't a turtleneck to hide anything decently) Those walks were the only source of happiness I had because the feeling of walking away from my home was magical, and now I don't recognize the feeling of happiness. (It's quite ironic since my name means Happiness in Hindi) Please help me. Or at least give me some answers, some information. Please let me talk to someone from your association. I am begging you, I need this help. I need to tell you more. I have some money with me, I can give it. You can do tests on me even, please just talk to me. I have a high IQ, and am about to major in psychiatry myself. Please contact me here or my number is **********. 

Regards,

I know I was coming off desperate at the end but I am. I'm severely depressed but I don't want to be! I don't want to be like this anymore. It's been too many years of this abuse and I cannot bear it with how bad the depression has deteriorated my brain. If anyone wants to talk about this more, please feel free to dm me. I am on another account then my main one cause I don't want anyone recognizing me or friends knowing I posted this.

"Kinda a long post. And I'm sorry. 

I've spent majority of my life following in other people's footsteps or following a path someone else created for me. I've never really been given the chance to create my own footsteps.. until now. 

For the last year and a half I've been with a guy let's call Christian. He was great. Honestly. We never fought. We never really got mad. We always talked things through. We always made sure that we understood each other.  And he understood me. He knew me so well. He knew when I was having an anxiety attack and he knew what to say to coax me out of it. He knew how to handle my depression. And honestly I could say that for the first time in my life I was happy. REALLY HAPPY. It honestly seemed too good to be true. And i guess looking back it was.

In Sept he left to school. It's an odd school where he's on a boat and only has service at ports.  So I could only really talk to him every couple of weeks and only if he found wifi. Well most of his ports are small towns in countries that it's harder to find wifi. You can imagine how hard this would be. But we were managing. We were trying.  And in november I went to Spain to go visit him and everything seemed normal. But About a month ago he out of the blue dumped me. It was over text. He had called me earlier that day telling me he missed me and that he loved me. Then a couple hours later I got a text that turned my whole world upside down. 

I feel like a total wreck. It was so unexpected that I still have a hard time believing it. He left for sea shortly after and I've spent the better part of this month trying to survive. And while everyone around me has been supper supportive, I've never felt more alone. All I want is Christian.  And I want him to make the hurt go away like he always does. But now it's my turn to make myself happy.  And i don't know how. 

He comes home for semester break in 4 days and I'm not handling it very well. I don't want him to come back because just the thought of him in the same town makes me spiral out of control. 

This is the first time that I'll be able to focus on me without ever thinking of someone else when I make decisions. While I should be happy because it's a new chapter... I'm starting school..  moved into my first home... I've never felt more alone and empty. And the only thing that's been getting me through my day and keeping me asleep at night is my constant supply of weed. 

I literally have to stay high all the time in order to make it through the day. I have a therapist. I have a family. But I can't talk to anyone. I'm scared to open up because once I do I'm afraid I'll never stop crying.  

The worst part is he asked to see me when he's home so we can give our stuff back to each other. And talk about moving on. But I've let myself go so badly that im embarassrd to see him. I've gained over 20 pounds since I saw him in november. I don't want him to know I'm suffering. Or to know I'm dying on the onside.  But he will know as soon as he sees me. I'm an emotional eater. 

I'm scared. I'm lost. And I don't know how to move on. I just need someone to tell me that im going to be okay. 

Tldr; my boyfriend dumped my ass leaving me feeling alone and unsure of how to find myself and heal.

"I wrote something poemy that basically describes my state  
I've been depressed for over 5 yrs and have trouble sleeping,very vivid dreams lately that just packs extra punch when you suffer in dreams as well in real life...  
NOTE: i wrote it very early in morining (4am) and i wrote like 2-3 poems in my whole life and i suck pretty badly at it

&gt;Dark creature fammiliar yet unseen, lurking in the shadows, now comes in.  
Fear comes, believe my eyes, i cannot!  
My body starts shaking in terror, as the creature fades my despair sets.  
As fear comes cold and bare, i can't seem to shake the despair.  
My own mind cursed i did, but help, it did not give.  
To ease my despair sleep, i shall i said to myself.  
  
&gt;As i fell asleep another trouble came quick.  
I enter a world, dream yet not a dream, i am wake but sleeping, resting but weeping.  
A world filled with despair as my own yet different.  
World as vivid as life itself, i curse myself in a dream as in life.  
I curse myself, i suffer as i did, in a world as vivid.  
  
&gt;I wake up can't think, dream yet pain, memories not forgotten, no! i remember it all, the pain continues as i try getting up, but move i cannot!  
There i lay thinking ahead, why i move cannot? suffering in a bed.  
It stroke me as lighting in a tree, it's not my bed, im still not free!  
Opening my eyes i woke up in dread, all soaked up, really this time, the terror stroke me as i remember the dreams, the suffering, as real and vivid it can be!  
Reliving it again, like the first time, suffering, giving in.  
Despair setting in as i weep, can i get some rest i plead.  
Suffer i cannot, rest i need.  ",5
"Depression and I are at a constant battle. I was home alone for Christmas Eve and it was driving me insane. I felt like ripping my hair off gahhhhhhhhhhhh! To cope with the depression I urge myself to go out. I got put my pants on and went out. I thought to myself what the fuck can be open at 8:30pm that's when I passed by Angel City Brewery. It was fucken open. I went inside, it was almost completely empty. I got me an IPA and started walking around, I ended up going to the balcony they have. I sat down on some of the couches they have. I started browsing Reddit like usual, reading every depression post. I was half way done with my beer when some one speaks to me. âIs some one sitting here?â I asked myself is someone speaking to me!? I looked up and it's a girl. I remember stuttering âI'm sorry?â She repeats âis someone sitting hereâ I say âoh noâ she asked if she can join me and I say yes. I'm looking at her while she's looking around her surroundings looking totally confused. She looked like a very antisocial person. I asked her if she was okay. She said that she's never been here before and asked why it was so empty. I chuckled and said â maybe because it's Christmas Eve?â We both laugh. Soon and then I started feel a warm sensation in my stomach, I began feeling nervous, my depression felt like it was suffocating. 
She asked me â do they have margaritas here?â I giggled. I said no, it's a brewery they only have beer. She looked paranoid. I asked if she was okay. She said that she doesn't really go out by herself. Then she asked me if I was waiting on someone. I said no, I usually go out alone. I kept looking at her, I asked her what was her name. She told me Maria, I introduce myself. She asked why was I here by myself. I told her I just needed to get out. 
She told me she wanted a drink and asked me if I can go with her to get her drink. I said of course. I started getting even more nervous, asking myself why is this person talking to me. We got to the bar and she ordered a drink, I ordered one for myself since I had finished mine. She grabs her pure and pull cash out and tells me âI'll payâ I responded âOh no, it on meâ she said thank you. 
She asked if they had any games here, I said of course they have board games. We ended up grabbing Jenga. We went back to the sofa I was sitting at. I've never played jenga before so it was my first time. Boy did I fucken suck.  We talked for a while, and told me she moved back to LA from Mexico and to pardon her bad English. I told her what you talking about you speak perfect English. As I got to know her, my depression starting go away, I felt happy, I was smiling. 
It was about to be 10pm when she told me she was feeling tired already since she had a long day. I didn't want here to leave, I was enjoying this so much. I told her that it was fine and that I was thankful for sitting with me. I walked her downstairs and we put the jenga game back. We looked at each other for a second. She asked if I wanted her number, I blanked out for a second. Then she said â you know what let me have yoursâ I gave her my number. She told me it was nice meeting me. And told me I should go home soon because it wouldn't be okay to keep drinking. We shook hands and she started walking away. I just looked at here leave the exit, I felt my depression coming back. I walked to the bathroom looked in the mirror when it hit me. FUCK I FORGOT TO GET HER NUMBER!
I rushed to the exit and to the street, all I see is a white Lexus pulling away. She was gone. 
I been thinking about her constantly, hoping she would text me or call me. I went out New Year's Eve alone. I kept thinking about her, how happy she made me feel. My depression was gone for that time I was with her. Yet here I am at the same brewery and the same couch her and I met drinking the same beer buzzed as shit . I just want to thank this brewery Angel City for being open New Year's Eve. And specially thank you Maria for coming up to me and giving me the best company I had in a while. I hope you text or call me...",5
"If you think getting someone to marry you and swear their everlasting love to you will make it any better, it doesn't. It just makes it harder because instead of having the freedom to break down and cry, you actually make another excuse to stay in the bath tub for 2 hours and just feel lonely, hopeless and isolated. 

And then after that, you come out of the bathroom and pretend work is stressing you out and act cheery and happy over dinner that you don't even taste anymore because literally everything is just not good anymore. 

And then the whole thing repeats, 7 days a week. ",4

"I called out of work today, and no I wasn't hung over from a night of partying. I was working until 11 last night. In the last two days I worked 30 hours, and in the next two days I'm working 21. I've been extremely depressed lately to the point where I found myself seriously considering suicide. I've been in a really bad place and haven't had the time to process any of what I've been dealing with.

But I still feel really guilty and like I'm a bad employee. I'm really scared of my boss or coworkers hating me. I've never taken a day off before, and I feel like I really do need it. Plus, there are some people at my work who call out pretty often and nobody seems to care. So why am I so stressed and scared about this? Am I wrong to call out?",2
Kinda random question.. when was the moment when you realised there was something wrong?  ,0
"It's currently 4 in the morning and I'm feeling very stuck. I feel like nothing has changed since I can remember. For some background, I've had depression since about middle school. I guess I still don't know if I want to call it depression since I haven't been diagnosed yet but I've always just had trouble finding any positivity in my life. In school I've never been popular but I could be considered as well liked. From what I know most opinions of me are positive but as I said that's from what I know. My response to being sad has always been to try and focus on other people's problems and try and help them. The problem with this is that all this has done is made me worse off. I feel like no one puts in as much effort into relationships as I do. Friends always seem to be eager to take my advice and then when I ask for help they run. The person I considered to be my best friend did this to me over the course of last year and I'm still sad about it. We stopped talking for a few months and today they invited me to hang out with them on New Year's Eve but, while I still care about them, I don't want to put myself back  into a relationship where I put my all into it and then I ask for help and end up getting hurt. They tried to help me in the first 2 months that they knew about my depression (I feel like they actually did help me for the duration of the 2 months but for some reason that is hard to admit) and then after that he just gave up on me. That hurt more than anything else because I know I would never give up on him. In the absence of him for the last few months I've tried to go to counseling at my school. That worked for a week and then after some work I realized I should get a therapist to help. The counselor had to call one of my parents because, being a minor, I have to get parental consent to get a therapist. She never did. It's been about there weeks since she said she would do it. That really helps. Now I'm stuck trying to solve my situation alone because I've been in it for so long that I've isolated myself from others. The point where I held a gun to my head and almost killed myself is when I think I finally realized something was very wrong with me mentality and I needed to do something about it. That was 6 months ago. Help feels like it's so hard to find. My counselor hasn't helped, my parents haven't, and my past best friend hasn't. I also have other âfriendsâ that I found security in and then I realized that they talk about me behind my back and make fun of my depression. They also make fun of the same thing with another friend of mine who is in that group and that pisses me off more then them talking about me. 2017 has been the worst year of my life. At least I learned that I need help but it's been so hard to find. It's made my depression worse and I'm starting to lose hope again. In 2018 at the least I'll try to look at things more positively this year. All that I know is that 2017 has taught me that good help is hard to find. That is why I'm sitting here at 4am on a reddit account I just created venting to the void.
Thanks for reading my huge wall of text. I hope something in all of my rambling possibly related to you and helped a little bit. Good luck in 2018 and I hope this year works out for you. I know I need it to work out for me. Thanks again and have a happy New Year. ",4
"In the past two weeks, I haven't spoken to a soul. When I was a kid, people always said that I was chatty. It took me a long time to realize that I spoke all my thoughts trying to get the inability to have a conversation out of my system. It's years later and sometimes I think it's better to be alone. It takes so much for me to hold my self together. So much to not end my life. I hope someday I'll be glued back, or someone will help me carry the pieces. In reality, however, I'm constantly scared that if I let someone come close, they'll break me even more. It's like standing in front of a cracked mirror. The reality is distorted. Self image delusional. A few more cracks and it would all come falling down.",4
"I feel like a hypocrite posting here, because I've only now started actually realizing I might have depression and I might've been fighting it for some time without realizing it, but today was a horrible fucking day and it got better just now. 


So. I charged my iPad today. And found this account. I got into my post history, and surprise surprise, I find a thread from last year. I barely even remember making this post. But if you don't want to read it, generally I complained about having no friends and a girlfriend, I felt like I'm doomed to never have friends, I said I ""overcame"" social anxiety which I never did, and I felt like everyone was better than me. I wanted to quit my job back then, after only 2 weeks, because I couldn't handle the anxiety of working with others there (an anxiety I wasn't even aware of, by the way). 


I didn't quit. I kept working there. And you know what? Everything I wished for back then have come true. I made tons of friends at work. Everyone loves me there. To this day I hang around with people I'm only going to meet 8 months after making this post! That's crazy. My confidence has boosted. My self esteem has boosted. And the funniest part? I have a girlfriend. Back when I made that post, I had already met that girlfriend, I just didn't know how things are going to unfold. 


So yeah, everything I wanted was solved. And with the solutions came new problems. Life isn't always fun or good, problems just keep coming our way. I wanted friends? Good luck learning how to handle and keep friendships. I wanted a girlfriend? Oh buddy. You're going to have to tackle your worst insecurities, fears and ugly sides of yourself because you're sharing life with another person now. I wanted more confidence? That just means I'm going to get out of my comfort zone more times, and believe me, the same fear is still here.



What I'm saying is, to all of you sad mothercukers out there, the world sucks. Life sucks. I'm sad right now, the most I've ever been sad. I'm on anti depressant, go to therapy, and shit, there no solution in sight. I can't remember crying as much as I did today, ever. 

But just know. All of you sad brothers and sisters. Know that it gets better. Wether you want it or not. Wether it happens in a month, year, or 10 years. Things change for the better. If the world can turn against you, it can also turn in your favor. You just have to give it the opportunity to do so. Non of us want to get out of bed, to work out, to socialize. I know the pain my dudes. But you gotta keep doing it, because the potential for things to get better is there if you only give the world the opportunity to do so. So give yourself the opportunity to feel better. Please. It's a new year. You don't have to be happy, you don't have to feel good. Both of those are the world's job. Your job is to stay hopeful. So stay hopeful, and let life do its thing. It will definitely give back one day. I feel like fucking shit today , but  the moment I press ""submit"" I'm going to brush my teeth, drink a cup of water, and meditate for 5 minutes. Because I don't have to feel good to tell depression ""fuck you!"" in the face. So fuck you depression! ",5
"Has anyone ever felt like they didn't want to explain to their friends/family/spouse about how incredibly sad you feel. I don't know where my sadness comes from. I know I feel selfish because there are children dying of starvation and I cry alone for hours about nothing. I just don't want to explain to people how I feel. Have you ever felt so incredibly in a dark place that you feel it may be contagious. Like I feel that I am going to drain the happiness from others around me. When people ask me to tell them how I feel, sometimes I want to cry because I feel like I am going to drain their happiness with my sadness. It's like a black slime that's enveloping me and if I touch others with my sadness then it will envelope them too. I know that isn't true but it's just a feeling.  I am trying to work and be a normal person but almost on a daily basis, I think how better I would feel if this feeling would stop. That I can't make this feeling go away and it's just a feeling that I always have. A feeling of loneliness even with people around. A feeling of sadness even though I have nothing to be sad about besides normal stresses. It's like constantly feeling sadness and you can't stop it. It's always there. Always on my back.

"I feel like most of us are leaning way more toward the emotional than the stoic. And as a male I have been trained to not be emotional, and also there really isn't a support system in place. Friends are great but it's more shooting the shit and screwing around than having sessions where i can just open up and cry. Even female friends of mine in the past seemed weirded out when i just needed to vent and share and break down a little. I have built boundaries that keep my self propped up on a bed of twigs to where i am solitary in what ever i am feeling. And when the weight is there those twigs snap and i have nowhere to turn. It's created i very unhealthy situation where it's all or nothing. If i open up i gush, and if i don't then you will never see that side of me. I'm sick of ""maning up"", sick of having to accommodate some bullshit notion that i can't feel. I was always a sensitive kid and i am a sensitive adult but perpetually hiding behind a mask of indifference which creates a cognitive dissonance on the basic story of who the hell i even am. When im ""stable"" im just living a lie i've been trained to live. And when im broken all the feelings i've suppressed come out and bite me right in the ass and boom i can't function anymore. 

How can you create balance?  I feel like most people are able to ride both conforming with the world and expressing themselves in some kind of way that doesn't have to be at total odds with each other. Where when something triggers them, they don't fall into a state where they can't even take care of themselves. Obviously there is a lot to do with the fact they have a more balanced brain chemistry, and their threshold for pain is far higher but i still think there is something to this lack of balance that contributes heavily to depression in general. 

Also, sidenote, as a man how in the hell can i find someone to open up to? I just need to talk sometimes and need a hug and don't want the entire emotional burden to be placed on a SO (which i scare away due to said mistake). I love the few friends i have but they in no way can offer that kind of support. ",4

"I **need** this year to be better.

I'm nearing the end of my third year of college. The new semester is approaching quickly, and I desperately need a good one in order to save me from failing.

I failed two courses last semester. I was miserably depressed the whole time and it showed on my GPA. That was my free pass; I can't afford to fail any more. If I do, I won't graduate on time. If I don't graduate on time, I don't graduate at all because they'll cut $8000 of financial aid and I can't magically come up with that money myself.

But this year doesn't have to be like that. I don't believe all of the bullshit about how the new year promises change and hope. It's literally just another day, except the year is different. Still, I'm mildly optimistic. 

I've never been a hard worker, but that has to change now. I know exactly what I have to do to be a successful student; doing it is just impossible sometimes. 

My depression is like a roller coaster. Before Christmas I felt amazing, and now I feel empty and broken inside. That worries me: if it comes back in full force in the middle of the semester, that could cause a great deal of damage.

Regardless, I wish you all a great new year. Hopefully this one won't be quite as shitty.",2

"I know right. The feels. I don't expect any responses. I just like this subreddit because it's good to get your thoughts out there every now and then. I reread all of this and I wrote way too much. It's basically just an essay about my current state of mind in regards to mostly romantic relationships. Normal relationships are a whole other story.

There is something fundamentally wrong with me. It's not even part of my depression I think. It's part of me. I don't feel human because I don't think I contribute anything to society, and what seems to be a lack of wanting to interact with society.

Am I okay with being alone? I like being alone. I will have a twinge of loneliness occasionally. I'm sure if I didn't have my online friends I would feel loneliness more. I feel like I lead two lives. A social life online, and a lone loser irl.

I'm wondering what is stopping me from finishing my okc profile. I don't want to put the pictures on there. I don't want to write anything positive about myself. But most of all I don't want to interact with any of them. I don't want to meet anyone.

And I don't think it's just a fear of men. I think it's a fear of people in general. What good are they to me? Relationships with real people are too complicated too exhausting. Making conversation is excruciating. I become way too invested in other people and they don't reciprocate. It's painful.

Physical contact scares me. But I want it at the same time too. I have memories of being very young and wanting to be carried. But no one would carry me. My dad would carry my sister then be too tired to carry me. I grew to hate touch. I hated it when distant relatives would visit and want to hug me or kiss me. My parents barely ever did that so why should some strangers.

The best days I've had recently have been the ones where I have been completely alone, completely uncontacted by family. And I usually spend them alone in my apartment. Like a zoo display.

Love and companionship. I crave it and hate it at the same time. I go through periods of extreme sexual frustration where I long to have a partner. But the thought of doing something so intimate with another human frightens me at the same time. Sex is a mystery to me still, at 26 years old. I've watched porn, I've read erotic fiction. I've read about techniques and experiences others have had. I can do things that are close enough with other people online. But the thought of meeting in person to do anything is scary. I've had opportunities but I don't want to follow through with them.

When I was 14, I had an online boyfriend. He lived a few hours away and we wanted to meet eventually (although even then I had my reservations). He was 4 years older than me. My parents knew nothing about him. When he called my house my mom yelled at him and told him to leave me alone. We pretty much broke up after that. I felt ashamed and stupid and very bad that I caused someone else pain at the same time. I worried my parents and I fucked up the guy. Can't do anything right. Anyway I believe that first ""love"" of mine, and its conclusion, left an impression on me. The worst part might've been that after the incident, my parents never really could talk to me about it. They would try and I would deny it because I didn't trust them. And they kind of just dropped it. Maybe it was worse in the end because it seemed like they didn't give a fuck and went back to doing whatever it is they do instead of parenting.

After that first one I fooled around here and there, and had a second serious boyfriend when I was about 16-17. He was 6 years older than me, and lived across the country. He was very sweet and never pressured me to meet up or anything. I know there's also the element of me being a minor and them being older. I was never abused though. Maybe emotionally confused at times.

These little contained online relationships satisfied me well enough. I could get emotional companionship and sexual release. Usually without having to see their face or have them see me. After those two I've dabbled in similar more casual encounters if I ever feel the need.

The only real life thing that happened was freshman year of college. There was a guy I found cute. He was in 90% of my classes. It seemed like he was flirting with me because he was always distracting me from my notes, and sitting next to me in lecture halls. I hugged him once, and felt really fucking awkward and hated it. My height. My height is awkward. But that's only a contributing factor. It's that it's unnatural to me. That whole stint ended badly with me putting myself out there and getting fucked over. And my way of getting over it was to cut him out of my life as much as I could, and apparently to give up on looking good and gain 20 lbs lol!

So why should I make a dating profile where I'm expected to meet them in person. It's not necessary. If I don't I won't have to risk being hurt or revealing how awkward I am. This whole profile business seems disingenuous. I misrepresent myself because in words/online I can seem amazing. I'm okay at taking pictures that make me look halfway decent. But I realized I look awful irl. And my personality does not match up. I'm pathetically ""shy"" you could call it; or just mentally ill. I hate having to write positive things about myself to make it seem like I'm all gung ho for dating and human interaction. I don't want to sell that false image. Then one day they just realize that I am just a big bundle of depression and anxiety. A burden they weren't signed on for.

I kind of digressed fro the original topic I wanted to dissect. I am not physically attracted to most people. I can find women beautiful sometimes. And recognize when someone meets society's standards of beauty/sexiness. This has torn me up inside for years. I'm so confused about my sexuality. Men are hardly ever physically attractive, but I enjoy their companionship. Women like I said are only rarely. For the most part, I can only be attracted to people if I know them for a while and get to know their personality.

I'm at a stage where people are just trouble to me. I don't want to deal with it. They've hurt me too much in the past so I guess it's that I've learned to stay away. Self preservation. I'm not a risk taker. I have not had many positive interactions with people. I try too hard to fit in. I just want to be unnoticed.

When I was younger I had fantasies of becoming a functioning adult. In my fantasy I would've already been married and had kids by now. I don't think that will ever happen. And I've pretty much accepted that and don't really care any more.

I think its this unenhanced version of sexual/emotional frustration that prevents me from trying harder to assimilate with society. To pursue the role of a lover or my ""endgame fantasies."" I know I would make an amazing girlfriend/wife/mother. I would devote my life to my potential loved ones. I'm probably the perfect fit for some gamer guy out there (minus my depression and anxiety and secret desire for constant attention). But it just doesn't seem worth the trouble of going through the motions to get there. What's the point?

What would even make me happy any more? My ideal life at the moment is sitting alone in my apartment, and I know that's unhealthy.",5

"~~I apologize if this does not qualify for this subreddit, but I don't know of a better place to talk about this.~~

I never felt like my family truly loved me. They say they do, but all the times that they interact with me feel fake, like they're just pretending to like me for appearances. This is what my gut is telling me, but I don't know if it's reliable.

I wonder if I'm a sociopath. Everyone loves their family, right? So why can't I?

I hate a certain half sister of mine because, growing up, she would always call me names, make fun of me, and just generally treat me like garbage. But anyone I would complain about this to never thought this was anything to complain about. They would be like ""Oh, that's just how sisters are"" and ""Oh, I understand. Me and my siblings fought a lot too, but we still love each other.""

The thing is, I can say with confidence that I DON'T love my sister. At best, I'm indifferent to her. At worst, I want to kill her. But I certainly do not ""love"" her.  I told her this and...it apparently made her cry.

Wait...are you serious? You expected me to love you after the way you've treated me my whole life? Am I crazy to not love being bullied? Am I just weak for not being able to tolerate this so called ""typical sibling banter""??? I need answers, damn it!!

Then there's my father. He's...an asshole. He just is. I really don't feel like getting into how he's an asshole, since I just got through talking about my sister. But anyway...

 Unlike my sister, nobody denies that he's an asshole. However, I am expected to put up with him anyway. Because my father is 71 years old (turning 72 next month), he has been deemed ""a product of his time"" and therefore is allowed to be an asshole because old people are too old to listen and therefore
 I should ""pity him"" because ""he's a lonely old man"". 

But here's the thing: I DO pity him. Of course I do, he's a pathetic human being. But pity =/= tolerate, which is what they're implying when they tell me this. I don't know why they expect me to tolerate this outdated piece of human history when obviously the best option is to throw him in a museum (retirement home) and let him expire. I don't know how I'm an asshole for feeling this way, but I guess I just am.

Those are the main two people that I hate out of this family, but I honestly don't care for any of them. I never felt like I truly belonged in this family. I was always ""the quiet one"" that everyone ignored. I often fantasize about ditching these people and moving to another part of the country, and meet people that I can ""truly connect with"", but of course that'll never happen.  For one, ""truly connecting"" with people would require me to socialize, and I'm as asocial as they come. Two, I'm such an emotionally weak, weak-willed, codependent piece of crap that the very idea of moving away and being all alone is too much for me to bear.  

I'm sure I probably just sound like a whiny spoiled brat to you all.You're probably wondering: If I don't have the guts to ditch them, why don't I just deal with them? Well, they clearly never wanted to deal with me all my life, so why should I?.......................Right?...RIGHT???

I don't know... What am I saying? I don't even know what I want...

Obviously, there's something I don't like about my family, but I don't know what it is, so nothing will ever change...... What if there's actually nothing wrong with them?....What if I'M the problem? What If I'm just a horrible person that will never be satisfied no matter what I do? If I can't be satisfied with what I have, do I just not deserve happiness? I don't know when I became so terrible....Wasn't I always like this? They say no one is born evil, but...look at me....

I'm not sure why I typed all of this out, I doubt anyone will read it...and if you did, sorry for wasting your time...

"I've suffered with Depression myself and managed to help myself out of it on my own; however, I know it's different for everyone. My brother has been to the therapy to treat his depression but he is still struggling and I don't know what to do. He always believes that there's no light at the end of the tunnel and that he'll never be happy no matter what he does. He even said he can't even take his own life because that would be to selfish of him, in other words he's only alive because he has to be for my family. You can tell him one thing to make him feel better like "" You""re not alone"" or something that is very similar to the way he feels and he will completely dismiss it. please I don't know what to do.. I don't want to lose my brother..",4
"About two years ago, I was having issues with my mental health, and I was given Prozac. After a week or two - I can't remember the exact time - I had something that I think might have been a psychotic break of sorts.

I cannot remember my line of thinking at the time, but long story short, I found myself walking down the road (meaning I had walked down my driveway which is all jagged rock and about a mile long, and about another mile down the road). My pocket was full of pills and a knife-like object.

I believe I was headed to a pizza place which is miles and miles away. I've never actually put that into words, but I am now realising stupid that is. I have no idea why I was going to there. I either wanted to end it or run away, but again, it's fuzzy.

I am posting this to ask if it is a normal type of occurance or if it's indicative of something else or some other type of mental illness.

Thank you.",3
"Spent my birthday crying in bed, spent 4th of July (and all summer break) in a psyche ward, barely lasted a month in school before they ""decided not to let me back for a little while"" because of suicide attempt, lost my virginity only for that same girl to call me sick and pathetic a few weeks later. Spent Christmas crying while 911 paramedics and my parents stare at me(ruined the party), and now on new years I still contemplate suicide via electrocution. I don't know if 120vac is enough to kill but god, I hope so.",4
"I've (31/F) struggled with depression my whole life. Grew up in an abusive home, had abusive relationships, bad marriages, etc..I've even tried committing suicide a couple of times. I've been to therapists for the better part of 30 years, and I've been on every antidepressant they could prescribe, with little positive results. It just doesn't help. I've been pretty okay for the last year or so, though. In fact, I've been happy... I started writing poetry again, and started teaching myself ASL. I felt hopeful for a future. But I've hit a low now that's lower than low. Lower than I've ever been, and my husband has basically told me to either kill myself already, check myself into a ward, or shut  up. I know, it's not exactly the supportive phrase you want to hear when you're already depressed, but there it is. I'm not going to kill myself, that I know. I've got two kids, and I can't. But I find myself with this incredible urge to run away- just disappear and never come back. And I don't want to do that either, because I love my kids. I don't want to die, I just don't want to live anymore, if that makes sense... 
Anyway, I'm going to check myself into a psych ward, but I'm scared. I don't know what to expect. If you've ever been to one, could you please share your experience? What were you there for, how long did you stay, and did it help? Please be kind here. I can't take much more negativity right now. I just need to know what I'm in for. Thank you. ",4
"Hi guys, I was just wondering whether any of you have been in this state of mind because. I can't find anything when I google it. 

I am a 21 year old male from the uk and have recently graduated and got a job out of uni. I'm from a comfortable family and my parents are still together and have been great all my life. I have a good group of friends who I see regularly, but all my life I've had a sort of apathy for living.

 I'm not sad and I'm even happy most of the time but I can't help feeling that life is fairly meaningless and it has always been really difficult for me to do anything. I don't really enjoy anything other than smoking weed and doing downers, such as Xanax, codeine and Valium. I'm addicted to weed and really struggle not to do harder drugs everyday too, but despite this I manage to hold my life together, even though I am high most of the time. For me, everything in life takes the same amount effort, from working to going out or seeing my friends, and so far I have managed to keep everything together by promising myself to do 2 constructive things a day although this has become really draining recently and I'd prefer to just lie in bed all day. 

Despite not really caring about anything I also get really irrational fits of anger and always ending up breaking stuff or ruining friendships and I don't know why. Last night I broke up with my girlfriend who knew about my weed use but not much else, although she knew I did other stuff. 

She was the thing I cared most about in life and she honestly made me care about life for a year, but for the last 6 months I've been slowly going back to not caring. I was just irrationally angry and I broke up with her for no reason and even while I was doing it I couldn't stop myself and I've fucked up the best thing in my life. I really struggle communicating my feelings with her and so I just blow up and blow things out of proportion. 

Without her I don't care about anything and I just can't be bothered to go on living everyday feeling dead inside and occasionally very angry. But I can't be with herb because I screw it up every time. 

I don't want to die because my parents would be devastated and I care about them and my sister. But I do want to be dead because I can't be bothered to do life anymore, so I was wondering whether anyone else feels like this and if you have any tips as to how to keep going with it all?

Thanks for any responses. ",3
"I thought I was doing better, so I cut down on my antidepressants, like, in the spring. I was doing alright when university work wasn't so difficult. 

Then I had two pieces of coursework, one due in a week after the other, just before Christmas break. I couldn't meet the deadlines. I got a two week extension for both, meaning my final deadline ended a week into my Christmas break.

Now I have an exam on Wendsday, another on Friday and another the following Monday. I haven't been able to revise. I can't revise. I can't focus. When I try, I keep telling myself it's pointless. It was a mistake to try and go to university. It was a mistake to try and be successful or happy. I'm just going to be what I always have been, a pathetic, useless waste of space.

I'm going to fail these exams. It will be confirmation that I should never have hoped that I could be more than I am. Then what? I try and retake, when I'm busy with other exams? I don't know.

Why did I reduce my tablets? Because I was doing better? Because I felt I didn't need them? Because I actually thought I was actually strong enough to deal with my problems? And now I suffer the penalty for daring to think I could ever be ""better.""",2
"People I encounter, family, co-workers, employers, peers, use this demented perversion of Darwinism to suggest that I am unfit; that I have to be the one to adapt and adapt while the world remains static. They say, âIt's adapt for dieâ, and if I can't adapt then I don't deserve to be successful. Many people act as though because I am different that the onus falls entirely upon me to change myself. If I am a round peg and the only opening is a square hole, then I am expected to what, use brute force to fit in? There's no concern for personal tolls it takes to force myself into a place I don't fit into, and if I can't handle the pressure, the personal damage incurred by that process, then I get labeled defective, mentally unfit. My father tells me to follow the Marine Corps motto of, âadapt, improvise, overcomeâ, but life is not a military operation.

Instead of people trying to meet me half way, instead of people seeing the value in diversity of thought and trying to accommodate me even in the slightest, I am condemned for not being endlessly adaptable. I am not some âUbermenchâ, capable of endless internal rearrangement, I am a human person! Of course I can change, I can adapt, but I can't be someone entirely different; I'm not clay you can just reshape over and over again! 

I suppose it's easy to level such criticisms when you are aren't different, when you're not the one being told to give up what makes you who you are; when you're a square peg trying to fit into a square hole. People who don't have these difficulties say to me, âwhy can't you just be like me? If I could be successful, anyone could, so if you can't it's because your just being obstinate and unreasonable; it's your fault and you need to changeâ. Others take a more defeatist, pragmatic view and say, âthe world won't change, so you need to. If you try to be different you'll just be tilting at windmills. That's just the way it is, so just conform to what's expected of you and be pretend to be happy about it.â 

It makes me bitter, and people see that bitterness as unjustified and roll their eyes at it, only serving to intensify my bitter feelings. Why wouldn't I feel bitter? I struggle and struggle, only to have others devalue my experiences and scoff at my pain; to label me with all sorts of offensive stereotypes and make no effort to understand my position. People say, âdon't be bitter, it's not attractiveâ, but what else am I supposed to feel? I'm sorry the way I feel isn't attractive, but it's the way I feel and no amount of scorn and disapproval is going to change that. Wouldn't you feel bitter in my shoes? Fighting an uphill battle to just be yourself, without support, without validation of any sort, while no one seems to take you seriously? Am I supposed to just lie and counterfeit myself my entire life? What sort of life is that? It's one thing to struggle for find you path in life, it's another to have those who already have spit on me the whole way.  

My therapist once told me to pretend to fit in, to just fake it until I feel it, but I never felt it; I just feel more and more empty and dead inside. I feel progressively hollow, depleted, eroded away. I fear that one day there will be nothing left of me, that eventually I'll be nothing more than a zombie, shuffling from place to place without thought, without feeling.

I'm sorry I'm different, I'm sorry I can't just be like everyone else and feel good about it. I'm sorry about it every single day; I am made to feel sorry about it every single day. If I could I would be someone else, but I can't. I only hope one day someone will value me for who I am, instead of who they want me to be.

"Oftentimes when I am at home I remember all the dumb cringey memories of my younger years that I'd rather forget. Stupid shit like trying to lie to an easy-to-lie-to teacher that I did my hw, using someone else's project in ceramics class and getting sent to the office, and trying to steal a piece of candy off my teachers desk.

"Whatsup...

I'm 22. I haven't been *depressed* For my entire life... I can think of times when I have been extremely happily (mainly middle school), and very functional despite having mild depression, such as in highschool (prior state ranked athlete), but I was wondering if people with major depression (such as myself) or bipolar disorder, or even other mental illnesses are living in a constant genetic predisposition to depression, in which (when they're off medication), their mind/thoughts/senses are always in a strings length of a depressive episode.

For instance, picture an Instagram filter than is dark and bleak. I have always been a dark/unlively person and I learned to find bliss and stress reduction in my seemingly cloudy lifestyle/outlook. My ""happy"" emotions are mainly nostalgia and excitement. Like i said, i have been happy at certain points in my life, but i still always have that ""filter""... And sometimes I take solace in it.

But, is it safe to say that people without a genetic predisposition to depression's brains function (from birth) as a depressed person would function while on medication?",5
"I have suffered from depression my entire life. About a year ago it was at its worst. I went to a mental hospital, got an appropriate diagnosis and medicine. It was the best thing I ever did, but why am I still suffering a year later. 
Things I did right: 
Got sober (11 months) 
Gave up pot (only 2 days) 
Going to AA daily.
Going to therapy weekly. 
Taking meds.
Sleeping every night.
eating better (like every day) 
Went low-contact with narcissistic mother (moved out of her house) 
Got a REALLY good new job. 
Got a physical, getting blood work back soon, she thinks I am low in B12 and D
Broke up with boyfriend.  
Things I am struggling with: 
Still very low energy.
not working out.
not cooking, not eating that well, but better.
not drinking water.
hopeless.
I beat myself up daily.
Is this as good as it gets.

My psychiatrist seems happy that I am doing so much better than I was, but really, is this as good as it gets? I am glad I have removed the toxic people (mother, bf) and a bad job, from my life. But I haven't refilled it with new people. I am meeting new people at AA. I am uncovering a lot of abuse I suffered, but was unaware of. Turning up a lot of sadness. It's hard connecting with others. I wish I had hope. I feel like I will die alone.

So a little about myself and why I am posting here now. I have been lurking in this subreddit on and off since I found out it existed, about 6 months back. I've been dealing with a lot of dark thoughts and surprisingly don't even want to get better. I have no idea where all of these dark thoughts are coming from since I had a good childhood and was always a nice guy and good friends that I could count on. However, since I started university (2 years ago, in my final year now), I've distanced myself from my friends and to some extent my family. There was no apparent reason for it. This distancing however lead to me realising my own feelings more and more and to some extent ""find my inner self"". All my life I've dealt with my issues by helping others resolve their and I've always gotten by one way or another, with me abandoning most of my friends this has led to me not being able to help others. As a result of that I've had to deal with my own problems on my own and had to face them. Let's just say that did not go well. I am 6 months away from graduating and have zero idea of what I want to do with my life. I have my parents counting on me to figure this out and frankly that pressure keeps getting me into panic attacks every time I think about it and I start breathing faster, my heart beat goes up and I just want to start shouting. I know that this message is quite long but I've seen longer one's on here so I'm gonna stop while I still fall within the average and don't scare anyone off. I hope everyone is getting through their day alright.",4
"All my life I've had depression, I remember crying myself to sleep for years at about 8/9 years old, I was always an outcast. I cried myself to sleep because I couldn't understand the world, nothing made sense to me, just so confused at how anything worked, one day I'm just not going to exist and I don't think I could imagine living forever so what did I want?

I made friends with girls, losing my best (m) friend to football. I became very alone in primary school. I would walk around with only myself to keep me company. 
There was a 'lunchtime supervisor' I guess you'd call her who noticed I was always alone, I'd wait by this fence for her to come up to me, she always had sweets hahah. We used to walk around together and talk. 

She left and I guess I just always was with girls. People played me, even at that age but it was okay, it wasn't that bad. You know, popularity was a thing even at that age. I had a bestfriend at some point (f) but she was popular and I was wierd. 

Highschool came, I choose to be in her form and another girl's, she kind of hated me at that point but we got closer again. 

I've always been alone.

By yr 9, I made friends with this 'alt girl', Idk what you'd call her, she wash speaking to her older boyfriend, always had arguments with him. We quickly became bestfriends and even though I was depressed it was easily the happiest I'd ever been. 

I started smoking because drugs always fascinated me and it was the closest I could get. We were both pretty popular, I a friend (m) who was popular that I'd play games with over Skype.  Good times.

Yr 10 came and my best friend left me for a girl. It crushed me and I began finding ways to drink, not that it was easy, just a few beers from my mum etc.

I quickly got extremely depressed, I became an easy target now that she was gone and I was confused, I guess I sortof 'followed' them round for a bit which must have made me an easier target.

People would make fun of me, call me gay and stuff because of my young shitty appearance I guess. I did try. I think I still played games over Skype with the guy at this point, which was nice, he was nice.

I switched to vaping to cut costs and for health reasons plus I could simply order stuff online. I vaped heavily as it was my coping mechanism along with self harm.

I remember turning into an empty zombie which was good because it let me cope.  I took caffeine pills everyday to keep me awake which actually improved my grades greatly because I've always been so tired.

By yr 11 things were approaching a sort of neutral line. I hung round with a group that I knew didn't like me but I had always kept a little influence over people. My old bestfriend (f) had stayed my friend atleast, and we were still really good friends just she'd found someone better (aka a girl) to be bestfriends with.

I'm writing this now, in the second year of college, slightly drunk after smoking once again. (I had quit vaping for exams in yr 11). I finally (though it took all of last year) got meds for depression (fluxetine) I'm on my second week of taking it but I starting to realise that a simple pill isn't ever going to help me. I have gender dysphoria, I hate how I look, I can't stand my past and I'm so alone. I have my new bestfriend, let's call her lucy, we became friends walking home together and when thus other group went to town in yr 11. She has helped me so much and she is the only person that I've told about my depression, I've also told her about my gender dysphoria to an extent. 

I'm so alone rn and I realise that this isn't ever going to get better. I will always be a boy and a nobody. I'm not sure I can deal with the fact that I won't ever live the life that I've always dreamt of and I will always be mostly alone. 

I am so glad and happy that I atleast have her. 

It just doesn't feel enough anymore, I always think that ending it is just the best way to go. To be rid of my frustratingly depressing life.

Uni is going to be so hard to try achieve with my ever falling motivation, I'll try and hopefully go the same place as her and her boyfriend. It feels so fucking impossible to do anything, and I don't think anythings ever going to get better, with a pill and some therapy

"I started to think recently on how toxic my parent's behavior has been over the years, but since every time I tried to call them out they dismissed me I struggled with seeing those things as emotionally abusive, just a clash of personalities with them being overly harsh and me being overly sensitive, and I feel guilty since I know they love me and have always provided for me and that there are people that have much worse parents. I started to list out the things my father done, since they started earlier(around when I was 7-ish) than my mother's and I believe have been much more impactful:

* Made fun of me to the ladies working at a clothing store's changing area because I didn't know how to tie my shoelaces

* Yelled at me for spilling a soft drink on my shirt

* Yelled at me whenever I got the answer wrong when helping me with math one time

* Broke a game's cd rom in front of me because he could not figure out the puzzle

* Yelled at me for throwing a soft drink can on the garbage at school because I struggled to open it and was too shy to ask for help

* Yelled at me for letting kids at class use my empty water bottle to mix things different drinks in

* Grounded me on summer vacation because my cousin was bossing me around but didn't say a word to my cousin or my uncle

* Yelled at me in front of extended family in christmas and told me to go to bed early because one of the kids was bossing me around

* Never tried to hide that he puts his siblings over us, said christmas without them is not christmas, and once we didn't even celebrated it because my mother wanted just the four of us at home and he got angry about it. Always antagonizes us when he's around his family and makes us feel like burdens and annoyances to them.

* Told me I have shit on my head because I forgot to bring a coat when spending a whole day at my friend's house, never mind the fact that it was just two blocks away from mine and my father would drive me back.

* Once me and my brother were bickering and I accidentally hit his glasses, he shouted so my father entered the room, yelled and made us sleep early.

* When I came out I asked for a gender therapist or just someone with experience with trans patients, he got me a therapist who never had a trans patient before and was obsessed with having me remember the event in my childhood that triggered by dysphoria and dismissed my body issues because ""women have body hair too"" instead of actually helping me.

* I found a gender therapist so I gave him her contact info and said I wanted to see her instead, he said he'd call her. Months after I asked him about it, he just tells me she's ""biased""

* Up until I was 18 he'd always force me to get a haircut once my hair was long enough to partially cover my ears, my hair was always thick and hard to manage and he always gave me shit about it. One time he thought I asked the hairdresser to just trim the absolute minimum and went on a fit about how if I wanted to cut my dick off that's fine but he was not going to be a part of it.

* To this day he acts like me coming out never happened, the last he commented on it was years ago saying that I should study, find a job and then I can do anything I want to. I opened up despite how painful it was in the time I need his help the most and he just removed himself from that responsibility.

* Mocked the way I speak by mimicking me in a tone of voice as if he was imitating a disabled person more than once

ï»¿* He knows I'm scared of elevators since I'm 5 but always dismissed it, one day as a teen we were on one and the door kept opening and closing, it was fairly crowded with a baby stroller no less, I begged him to let us leave because I was terrified, he then yelled at me in front of everyone and told me he'd never take me out again.

* Around the same time we were on a mall's bookstore, he showed me a book but I wasn't interested, partially because of being severely depressed, he flipped at me and ran to the parking area to leave, with the rest of us having to follow him. Then went on a rant all the way back home.

* I lost count of how many mornings I woke up during a weekend to him washing the dishes while complaining at how much of a failure I am

* Dismissed and belittled my concerns, fears and problems over the years always saying something like ""what are you going to do about it"".

* Belittles my interests for being childish according to him.

* Get's angry at me for being scared of bugs and other ""feminine"" attitudes.

* Always makes me into the unreasonable one whenever I got visibly upset or angry at his behavior that he never apologizes for

* Always acts like he knows me better than I know myself, always sees malice in my thoughts and actions because ""he was once my age"". He never believes I'm genuine with the things I want or do, I'm always doing things because everyone is doing it.

* Constantly lies about things like pretending he took the dog to the vet, that he could not find something we asked him to buy, etc.

* Always use us as his emotional and verbal punching bags when he's frustrated at something or someone

* I always have to compromise, like not transitioning or always having my hair up now that it's long, but he never makes an effort to change or police himself on the things I've said that bother me over the years.

* To this day whenever he raises his voice or get angry even if I have nothing to do with it I get panicky.

* I feel like I have to walk on eggshells with him, if I say the wrong thing (speak my mind) or react the wrong way(react naturally) he's going to flip on me.

I was close to my father when I was very very young but the behaviors I listed started happening around when I was 6-7 so it's pretty much since then that I started to become distant, he feels like a stranger to me since I was about 14. With my mother we were pretty close and got along very well up until I was about 14. She's always been an anxious and jealous person but the bad things that happened in her past plus a lot of stress over the years made her insufferable. On top of anxious and jealous she's controlling, critical and judgemental. If I don't do things her way she won't stop criticizing me, if I call her out she starts pointing out my flaws. She's always looking for a opportunity to turn anything into a fight and then play victim and make everything about herself. If I get angry at her she just says I'm crazy and need to go to a mental asylum. She told me so many hurtful things over the years since I came out, that I'm retarded, that I'm a curse in her life, that she should have been a whore instead of a proper woman, etc. I can tell she regrets it after as she tries to hug and kiss me but she never apologizes. 

I know deep down they both love me and want the best for me, they had always provided and praised me and done what they could but when it comes to the emotional side of things I think they managed to break me completely while being completely oblivious to it, always suggesting I'm ""tired"" and ""moody"" due to a poor diet and lack of exercise and wondering why I'm like this or why I feel so uncomfortable next to them. I'm severely depressed, have social and some general anxiety to the point I'm practically a shut in right now with no will to live, I get that there are things I could do do make my life better, I just don't see the point anymore.",4

I've been diagnosed with Post-Concussion Syndrome and ever since there has been a disconnect with friends and family, a loss of the person I thought I'd spend my whole life with, and a crushing defeat in regards to continuing my education. I now spend my days tucked away in my dark room avoiding light, loud noises, and social interaction. It's not that I choose to isolate myself, it's that it literally pains me to do otherwise. I've never truly considered self-harm, it would lead to major issues for loved ones I would never want. My friends are already all consistently irritated at how difficult it is to hang out with me, but I don't know how that makes me the bad guy (they act as if I am dodging them out of distaste for them or something). Recently I was supposed to go to a big sporting event with a friend in my friend group, but due to the growing frustrations of the others about me, my friend dropped me in order to settle down any issues. After this I found myself seething with anger, but almost to the extent that it became nothingness if that makes sense. This is mostly just a rant, it's hard talking to anybody about all of this because no one seems to ever truly understand. Sometimes I have this burning anger in me about the way my life has changed, but lately I've had more of a sense of numbness. Just not caring at all about anything. I wish I could just move far away and restart but that's not happening, so I'm left laying in bed in the dark contemplating what could have been had the last few years gone differently.",5
"So I'm 23, I've survived two rare cancers that have badly affected my education in high school and university. I graduated university with a bachelor degree in business but my GPA is horrible, as my physical and mental health during my studies was terrible. My grades improved over time but the damage was done. I'm now looking for my first full-time job (I have a year of part-time work experience) and have had no luck since graduating in August of 2017. 

Its gotten so bad that I constantly doubt myself, I feel that I am stupid and really have no future prospects in terms of career. I constantly use various tools to try to justify to myself that I'm not a failure (such as IQ/Psychological Tests), but they really don't mean anything. I feel that I have to justify myself for things outside that were out of my control and obviously, people in the real world don't care and will more than often see me as a liability.
On top of this, due to my treatment of my second cancer, my left arm lacks fine motor skills. I'm already handicapped in the competitive job market and why would any employer hire me over some other graduate with better marks and is physically capable. 

My personal confidence is at an all-time low as well, being a 5'4ft balding 23-year-old doesn't help me fit in and frankly, with my understanding of how nature works, I am screwed. I am working on improving my overall physical fitness and am I by no means anti-social but I feel that I can't relate to any of my peers.

No one helped me during my life (outside of my family) and I have no idea what I want to do, I'm not passionate about helping others or any career objectivities or anything at all. I just want to work and be productive so that I can reach a point where I don't have to be. 

I think that I am an intelligent, moral person that can actually bring some value to whatever I do but no one is going to give me chance, because why would they? I don't want to end up on welfare and I want a successful career, I don't want to be rich or famous, I just want a purpose. Sure, it's my fault, I could of done better and now just like most of my life, I have to learn the hard way.   

What do I do? Do I go back and study something else to gain a better GPA (and more student debt)? I don't really have many options. Even if I go study something in demand, like engineering or IT, who is going to hire someone in a hands-on profession who can't fully use both hands?

"I find when I am at my lowest, the world seems incredibly hopeless and sad. I cannot smile, laugh, hope or dream. I do my best to get on with my life and not let the pain takeover. I get extra help when I need it, and medication is a great help. But some days it is just too much, and it becomes a real struggle to make it to the end of the day alive. I'm 24, no family and few friends. My world seems lonely and desolate at the best of times, and unbearable at the worst. It is wonderful people like yourselves who provide the light on my darkest days. My life has been saved countless times by the kindness of such people. You help me to give tomorrow another try. I will never be able to express my gratitude enough to those of you who take time out of your day to comfort me when I need it. The best I can do instead is to keep going, just another day. One day I hope I can provide the same comfort to someone as you all do to me. My name is Josh and thanks to you, I will still be here tomorrow. ",0
"It's totally arbitrary, and that really isn't a problem (any made-up reason to celebrate is fine) except that it makes me think about how miserable I was last New Year's, and every year as far back as I can remember - which is something I would never otherwise think about.  I mean, if I am depressed on May 3rd, I am not also upset that I was depressed on May 3rd last year too, because it cannot help but escape my notice.  But I know I was depressed on New Year's Eve of 2016, and every year I can remember before that.  It's the same every year, and that makes me feel even worse than I normally do.

What's worse, it marks another year during which I was totally miserable.  Every New Year's Eve, I am made to reflect that I felt just as bad over the last year as I did the year before, often worse.  I don't feel any better about anything in my life after a whole year having passed.  Every year I tell myself that I am trying harder than I ever have to be better, and that there is some prospect that in the next year there will be something in my life that makes it worth living, that takes a little bit of the pain away.  But every year have to realize that I was wrong.  I was thinking exactly the same thing earlier this year, but now I realize that I was wrong last year and I will be wrong this year too.  I would not be thinking about any of this if it weren't New Year's Eve.",5
"Ever since I started college (I'm a junior now) I feel so different than the person I was in High School. Back then people would tell me that I was funny, chill, nice, I was genuinely interested in people and made friends easily.

We were literally inseparable, but now even keeping up with them in our groupme has become a chore, at this point my friends don't even want to talk to me anymore. Recently even the thought of having a social interaction is so scary that when it actually happens I feel like I seem distant and uninterested causing people to dislike me. I wish I knew how/why this all started, I just want to be me again, not this boring asshole who never has anything to say. I haven't told anybody this because I'm afraid they either won't believe me or think I just want attention, and I really just don't know what to do.

I don't want to go back to school this week. It's hard being alone at school. It's hard finding a place to sit at lunch or where to chill in the morning.

It's hard to get over a breakup when your dad doesn't let you go out to stay busy with your barely existing friends. It's hard when you stay at home and try to talk to your ex when you know the conversation is going to end quickly. It's hard when you crave your ex's company just to not feel so alone but you know it's impossible. It's hard knowing your friends/peers are doing just fine with you isolating yourself. It's hard,2
"I'm 15 and from the UK, in year 11 in secondary school. I'm male and although probably not gay, probably not exactly straight either. And I'm autistic, self-loathing and fucking stupid.

I've got two (relatively) close friends, let's call them John and Steve. I'm starting to develop feelings for John, which doesn't help my situation at all. Occasionally I play PC games with them, but I haven't recently.

I've also got an old 'friendship' group from a few years ago who I am no longer friends with because they're narcissistic dickheads who were closer to bullies than to actual friends. There are two I despise the most - let's call them Mike and James.

So, over the past year or so John's been mostly hanging around with other friends (who I occasionally talk to however would not consider myself to be friends with) and largely been ignoring me in school. I've tried to ask him to talk to me more but he pretty much ignored me. I've not told him that I have a crush on him yet but that'll probably only worsen it.

That said, occasionally for a week or so he'll start trying to talk to me over his other friends. Surprises me massively, and definitely in a positive way, yet sooner or later he just goes back to his other friends and I'm just another passing person, just another one of the 1000+ people in my school, and he's barely even acknowledging our friendship. What annoys me even more is that when I am in a Discord (voice chat app for those who don't know) call with Steve (or someone else from my school), they'll sometimes add one of John's friends to the call randomly. I'm perfectly fine with this until they say that John's calling them and leave. Why would he call them all of the time and not me? It frustrates me so much.

And then there's Steve, who's decided that he's going to go hang around with Mike and James and their friend group. I tried to talk to him a few days ago on their Discord server. Mike and Steve instead left the server to avoid me, and not long after that I was banned from the server for trying to talk to my friend on it.

So, now I've got my best friend (and crush) ignoring me in favour of other friends of his and going out with other friends, my other close friend just kinda... ignoring me and joining a group of assholes instead.

Yes, I am that guy who stands alone during break/lunch (or recess for Americans), hoping that just one 'friend' will bother talking to me.

I'm not sure speaking to my parents will be a good idea here. They're all much more outgoing and social than I am, and had more friends than me in school, and I don't think they will fully understand how I feel.

I guess I could try opening up to John, but I'm scared it'll just break down the friendship we've had for nearly 2 years (which is a long time for me). He probably still won't want to hang out with me anywhere near as frequently as his other friends, either.

I don't think Steve would understand if I did open up to him, and I can't now anyway as he's decided to block me in favour of Mike. Downright fucking brilliant.

My final option would be to try talking to one of my old friends who isn't a complete cunt to me nowadays. There are a few reasons why I haven't tried to restore my friendship with them, mostly the fact that they're always around complete cunts who they're much closer to than they ever were to me.

My school starts again on Thursday, and I know that I'm probably going to be lonely the entire term. I just need to come to terms with it.

Anyway, I doubt anyone's going to read this, and I feel somehow worse after writing all of this down, but I'm going to force myself to submit this post anyway. Sorry for the post being horribly written as well; I don't want to read it again because it just makes me feel even more shitty.

"21 (M) with severe anxiety | mild depression (probably more than I admit). 

After graduating high school I did 2 years of generals in college. I didn't get my associates but I know that I'm really close and need to get that finished up. 

Before summer semester of 2016 I dropped all my classes because I hit a wall of depression, also couldn't see the Major I was in working out, and I couldn't pick a new one. I didn't want to waste money aimlessly taking classes with expensive tuition. I am currently on a leave of absence until November when I will have to begin paying my loans back if I'm not enrolled in any courses. 

Financial Standings: March of 2017 I got a full time job (40 hours a week) making $8.50/h I got a raise and will start making $10/h this pay period and my boss said that I'll get a $1 raise in the springtime. I live with my parents and they don't accept any money so 0 expenses on that front (I try not to take it for granted, I'm really grateful to them). I have a car payment of $150/month, but I plan on paying it off by March (~$3000 left). Also car insurance is about $150 a month.. I currently have ~$2000 saved up but I owe at LEAST $10k in student loans. 

I'm super demotivated and bored, nothing interests me career wise... Or at all really, I don't have many friends to hang out with, used to waste life playing video games but they're such a drag that I get bored in like 15 minutes.. I just don't know what to do at all except keep grinding my dead end job while sleeping in my parents basement. 

I guess this is just my Year-End Review... and I don't know what I'm doing...

"I have been trying for a long time. I dont know if I can ever get over the things that have happened to me in my life or if I can ever be happy. I have a daughter so I dont want to do anything that will make it harder for her. But I dont know what else to do. I dont know if Im codependent on this misery or what. I know every day I wake up its going to be more of the same. I hate feeling this way. I want to be happy and alive and 'me' again. But so much has happened and Im going to be 43 this month. Why should I keep trying to find solutions? By the time I fix what needs fixing...even if I can, Ill be to old to enjoy any of it. Im tired of living a life of pain and suffering. I mask it with smoking weed or meds. It seems like I just lose more as I go on. Friends pass away from disease or suicide, family members pass on. I am struggling with wether or not to end my life. I wonder if I should look for easy ways to do it. I keep thinking about it but the ways I envision all seem like horrible ways to go out and Ive been through enough pain. Why should I try to hang on again? I wish that I mattered. Or that I was important enough for someone to care. After 20 years of ptsd and the anxiety and depression Im in a place where Im unable to work or provide for myself. I dont know if I do or dont want disability or if I can even get it. I grew up cutting down trees, building houses and raising horses and what not. My pride is something that comes up over and over. Ive been out of work for over 5 years. Ive been kept isolated for most of that and its one thing to have therapy and medicine. But Im still stuck here dependent on someone who has abused me. But maybe I should give them more time. I know Im not perfect. I have my own issues. Maybe Im just screwing everything up with this line of thinking. But I do know that I am co dependent. After all the abuse and nightmares and the pain, I dont know if I will ever be able to live the life I want to. Why would I choose to stay like this? I dont want to keep going like this. This isnt how its supposed to be. Life and the world around us really does fascinate me and I always wanted to find a place in it. But after all this time of being cut off from it I cant keep coming up with reasons to just keep hurting. I dont want to have to keep coming back and doing things like this as a last ditch effort.  I used to be so resilient and able to bounce back, nowadays im just so worn out and tired and drained.  Life keeps dangling a carrot in front of my face.  And like a fool I try to chase it, just to to find more pain.  Im tired of trying.  Im tired of feeling like Im damned.  I dont want to get on here and make a post like this for attention.  I just DONT want to feel like this anymore.  And its getting worse and harder to deal with.  If there was a button I could push that would end it painlessly I wonder if i would press it.  When its like this I wonder why in the hell I wouldnt press it.  There were things I wanted to do with my life.  Things I was sure that I was here to do.  And now it seems my whole lifes purpose was just to suffer.  I still feel like that little boy who was beaten bloody as a kid and taught to live in fear.  Why is it that he cant get justice?  Life was suppose to be somuch fuller and more beautiful.  But for me, my mind is under attack more often than not.  I have been doing all I can for years now, Id be lying if I said some things havent gotten better.  But at this rate Ill never get there in time.  And Ive been doing it on my own with little to no help while other people are working against me.  When will it get better?  When do the good things start happening?  When can I rest?",1

"Hello. 16F here. I have been treated for my ADHD with various doses of Vyvanse for the past several years and I currently am prescribed 50 mg.

I abused and misused my medication this summer. Going back to school, I was no longer able to do that and I had to go back to my intended dosage. The adjustment was very difficult, and I completely withdrew from friends, would sleep excessively (5/3pm-6am most nights), and felt very fatigued and indifferent for about a month until I finally got used to being back on that dose. Still not sure if what I was feeling was withdrawal or not

I have never brought this up with my mental health provider in fear of losing her trust and fear of being taken off Vyvanse. 

On December 8th my father died. I had a very difficult relationship with him and a complicated childhood as a whole (alcoholism, parents weren't around, all that stuff). He lived in another country at the time of his passing, so I missed the last weeks of school to be with his family in his home country and I arrived back in the states on Xmas. 

I cannot be around my friends without Vyvanse. I zone out in my own thoughts, I resent them and find no joy in being around them. I feel so disconnected and alone from them, even though they are supportive.  On New Years, I was at a close friends get together and I felt like this and I went to the bathroom and for the first time had intense urges to self-harm. Called home, left the party, and got drunk alone instead.

I feel like I live in these two worlds as who I am medicated and who I am not medicated. Nobody knows the real me because of how different my personality is on Vyvanse, even I don't know the ârealâ me I've been on this drug so long. When I crash from Vyvanse now, I feel like Im in a dark deep hole. When I'm not on Vyvanse, I'm dissatisfied with everyone and everything around me, including myself. the only time I'm happy is when im on amphetamines. 

i cannot sleep anymore and I get about two hours every night. no sex drive at all and I am losing all my friends. I am just so exhausted.

Is this depression? Or just grief? 

Also is it likely my therapist will take me off my adhd meds if she finds out i previously abused them? ",4
"So i'm visiting another city with my friends, i knew upfront most of them would be couples and us single folks would be in minority, but what the hell, right?

I also overhead someone say ""but anon is the only single person here, which i didn't really want spelled out to everyone. 

The only thing i'm thinking of right now is this and if maybe there's a bus that leaves for my city soon and jump on it without telling anyone. 

So i don't want to do now, other than eat and drink myself to sleep, with the others. I'm not bitching that ""waah, give gf now, waah"", it's just that I don't like being made fun of for this reason. So what, i'm single, i'm socially inept, and i'm depressed. That's me. ",1

My jawline used to be so nice and prominent before I got braces, but now it's ruined.

I'm sick of people commenting on my looks. Whenever i try to feel better about myself, someone rips me down. I hate the way i look. I want to get a breast reduction but I don't have money. I am going to the gym but I feel like nothing is happening because I don't feel pain the next morning no matter how much I work out. As for my face, my braces are coming off soon and my teeth are still getting fixed so there is some hope. But I don't look the way i want to. 

It's so unfair my parents have good features and faces, whereas I don't. I hate the way i look.  This is why I have very low self esteem and another reason why I'm depressed. 

I hated how I looked for a very long time. I'm 17 and I think i have body dysmorphia disorder. I fixate on everything and constantly look at the mirror at my flaws. It sucks. Things did get better I'm not going to lie but I'm still not happy. ",3

"We had a rough day. 

You know, when you and your significant other argue. Those types of days.

But what happens when you think she's lost trust in you? It's a worse feeling than some of you think.

Maybe then, that's not necessarily a bad day. Some people have it worse. Even I know that. 

But sometimes it turns into something a little worse.

The truth was, was that I hadn't been talking to anyone else. I had swore up and down that I hadn't been, I mean, she was on vacation and I had promised to always be faithful.

And I had been. She just didn't understand the real truth that I had been telling her. She wouldn't believe me. 

I made bad decisions. This seems simple to anyone else who'd be reading this.

We argued some more. She blocked me right before I had gone to shower and that's right around when I realized some things.

I realized that I was a bad boyfriend, although I had always been faithful and loyal.

A bad friend.

Moments later, I could feel that familiar pattern of water patting on my back as it does every night right after my usual 5 hour shifts, every day.

Zoning out, I kept realizing why some people hurt themselves.

Why people killed themselves.

Sometimes the sky is grey much more than it is blue.

Maybe it was people like me. Maybe I was a bad person after all.

I wish I could've been someone better. 

So, in that case,

I'm sorry.

"Perhaps I'm feeling maudlin because it's New Year's Eve, and this is the time we're supposed to look back over the previous year and try to make positive changes and take action to ensure the coming year is a better one. But I've been stuck in the same situation for so many years that I just can't bring myself to hope anymore for change, and right now I just feel worse than ever. I'll try to explain concisely, if I can. Apologies for the really long post, but I've held this in for a long time and I needed to get this off my chest.

I've known since forever that my parents haven't had the happiest of marriages. The biggest (and according to them, only) problem they have is my grandmother, my mom's mother-in-law. Now, I am given to understand that most in-laws don't have great relationships. With my mom and her MIL, things have been... horrible from the start. Her MIL (I don't like calling her my grandma, because she disowned me at birth and ignores and belittles me every chance she gets) has constantly tried to undermine her, badmouths her publicly (and in our society - Indian - reputation is everything), manipulates my dad by behaving like a sick, helpless woman in front of him (although she's the healthiest woman you could ever meet, otherwise) and claiming she's been on her deathbed for the last 25 years, makes caustic comments about my brother and I, and tries to provoke fights between my parents as often as she can in the hopes of breaking them up. These are incidents that I have seen occur myself, not things that my parents ever told me. They've avoided talking about this directly with me, perhaps fearing that they were forcing me to believe one of them over the other/influencing my beliefs in some fashion. But I could see these things happening, even if I wasn't old enough to quite understand them for a while.

My parents filed for divorce when I was a year old, but somehow they managed to reconcile, with the outcome being that my mom was forced to give up her job and her dreams of studying further to look after me because of course her MIL refused to.

Until my brother came along 8 years later, I remember things were pretty bad in the house; my dad wanted us to live together out of fear for his mother's health and not knowing what accusations or stories to believe, my mom hated the way she was being made to feel in the house and the way her actions were being lied about. Little incidents began being blown way out of proportion on both sides, there were some pretty huge fights. I lived with my mom's parents for a while (I love them, and have a deep bond with them). I wasn't a go-between for my parents, not then, but I knew I was still in the middle of their arguments. They wondered if the divorce would still have fallen through if I had not existed. But I knew they both loved me more than anything, and that was all that mattered.

And then my brother came along - a somewhat late miracle. He's nine years younger than I am, and with him came a move to another city where the four of us could finally live together by ourselves, and things seemed to be better - at least on the surface. Another move, and things seemed to be looking up, because my parents only really ever fought about was this woman. I finished school, started college, was somewhat reasonably happy that my parents weren't fighting as much anymore. My priority became to make sure my brother knew a loving home, where our parents didn't just love us with all their heart but also loved each other.

Then this year, my dad had to move back to the original city we're from, and I didn't want that to happen. But it did. And now we're back to square one, seemingly, except square one looks a lot scarier now that I'm no longer blind to every little thing that angers them. My mother's going through menopause at the moment, but she's more of a physical slave to her MIL's more and more obscure household demands than ever. She's depressed because she doesn't see how much longer this can continue, this life that she isn't living for herself. My father's unable to understand why we can't all just get along and be one big happy family, but then again he's at work all day, and when he's home his mother behaves differently. For her part, my mom's MIL doesn't want to live with us; she thinks she has enough money to live alone, even though she claims she's too sick to even move on most days. My brother, thankfully, doesn't care about this ridiculous and unnecessary soap opera drama. That leaves me.

My parents now confide in me when I beg them for an explanation as to why they look so distressed and harried all the time. They've never badmouthed each other to me, but I can see more clearly now how unhappy this marriage has actually been, and how afraid they both are that the next 20 years will be the same muddled mess the last 20 have been. 

I wish I hadn't asked for explanations, and I feel guilty that I wish I were even more removed from it all than I already am. I'm on campus in another city for half the year, but whenever I come home it's to a negative, toxic, depressed atmosphere that makes sure my determination to be positive goes down the drain. I feel angry and ready to snap, too, even though I have no reason to be. I feel guilty for leaving my parents in this situation for half the year, and for enjoying myself even a bit when I'm out because I know how sad they often are back home. I just want this to be over. I want a solution to this problem. I find myself wishing my grandma would hurry up and die, and there's a dark thought I didn't think I'd be voicing out loud but here we are. If people I love, like my other grandma and my aunt, can die before their time surely people I dislike can also disappear. I know it's wrong to feel this way, and I tell myself to buck up and be normal whenever I'm depressed enough about the situation to think this.

It's not so bad as I'm making it out to be. There have been plenty of good moments - in their marriage, and certainly us kids have never once doubted how united they are in doing their best for us. But I want it to be like that *all the time*. I want that happy family life. I don't want this sadness, and I certainly don't want to be the one aware of the massive failure in communication that occurs very often. And then I think I'm wrong for feeling that way. Basically, I'm a huge mess.

"So I have clinical depression.  It's not super bad with meds, but it's always there and makes me perceive my situation as worse.  I basically live in the lap of luxury, with rich parents and an amazing acadmic school.  However, I am also extremely lazy.  I despise doing work and even though I'm pretty good at school (I'm a freshman in high school) I know I need to improve next year (first year at my school grades don't matter).  This is because I absolutely must get into Harvard.  All my siblings and both of my parents went there, and I would be a complete fuckup and embarassment if I didn't.  Perhaps it's irrational but it would be crushing to me, I might kill myself.  I have no friends at school, most people think I'm creepy (at the beginning I tried really hard to get a girlfriend and it backfired), overly pushy, annoying, etc.  My siblings, who I'm very close with, are rarely home, and I'm sort of the family problem child (they're all virtually perfect.)  My parents are usually good but they put me under a lot of pressure.  My life should feel good but I fucking hate it and I don't know how to handle 3 and a half more years of this with no friends, little sleep due to homework, boredom and stress.

"Call it FOMO, jealousy, whatever you wish. I have spent 22/24 hours of each day for the past 12 months at home, in a 10x12 room staring at a fucking computer screen, because I have lost the energy to do anything else. This past year has been absolutely the hardest (outside of when I was hospitalized against my will about 15 years ago, which ended up doing zero good for me, surprise surprise.). I have been to about 12 or so medical professionals, had 3 CTs, 2 xrays, been on 20 different medications, and they can't figure out why I'm sick. They say I don't have cancer, which while horrible would have at least been an answer. It is entirely fucked up, I fully recognize that, but there are days that if a doctor told me I have only a month or so left to live, I'd cry in relief. I've seen specialists who treat me as just another number who got unlucky in life. Unlucky in life, boy, that sure does sum it up though. Abusive family, criminal father, automatic black sheep from birth, poor, redheaded, fat from young age, bullied, sick a LOT, etc etc. Blah fucking blah. At least I'm not hungry, though, right? That's supposed to make you feel better, comparing your misfortune to others'. The problem with that is your experiences are exactly that. You can't help but view your continuing chain of fucking shit problems as well, exactly that, to be rather repetitive. I don't know, I guess I'm ranting. I feel like I'm taking up space. I even thought about what my room would be used as once I'm not around anymore, whatever that ends up meaning. Maybe Mom could convert it into an office. That'd be nice. I do live at home, but at least that's for a good reason I suppose. Those 2 hours I mentioned? That's transporting my elderly grandfather back and forth from his day care program. He has Alzheimer's and Dementia and I keep an eye on him. God knows why they trust me with him. I'm the fucking psychotic asshole, right? I could keel over any minute (hopefully) and then what? I guess he'd go to a nursing home. So I suppose I'm a better choice than those nightmarescapes of fucking places. I don't know. I just want to fade away without harming anyone else, or myself for that matter. I don't -want- to die, but I don't see much of any other option.

You sometimes drink 12 diet mountain dews every day. You exercise way too much and are severely underweight for your height. You cry all the time and feel sorry for yourself. I love you so much but I think you need to work on yourself.

"This is quite a lot, but I really hope at least one person will read through. This means the world to me.

He's a great person. He constantly puts others over himself and he treats me amazingly. This is the man I can see a future with, and he does too. But his depression and anxiety causes him to act in ways he didn't intend, and it affects the relationship negatively. For example, sometimes he doesn't seem enthusiastic to do many things, he has a negative attitude on just about everything, and loses motivation to do anything except stay home. He constantly has anxiety attacks, and often misses classes because it is so bad and he can't get out of bed. It's been like this since the beginning, and I've tried everything to support him. I stay with him through the attacks, I try to give him motivation to get out of bed, and I constantly shower him with love and appreciation.

It started to affect me as well. I started having panic attacks and feeling quite depressed all the time. It's caused me to break up with him about 2 months ago, as I decided that maybe this isn't in my best interest since it's been affecting me so negatively. I didn't want to constantly be brought down, and knew that I would have to deal with this for the rest of my life if I wanted to stay with him.

After a week of talking it out after the breakup, we decided to just take a 2 month break and work on ourselves and problems in our relationship. I had self image problems, wasn't very patient, and could be quite stubborn sometimes, and it certainly affected how I treated him and the problems in our relationship. Taking care of him also made me forget about self-care. I'm better than ever, have improved on myself, made friends and stopped being so reliant on him, and I feel ready to go back in with a more positive outlook on myself and the relationship. However, it is still very hard for him, and although I feel like I've improved and changed tremendously over the course of 2 months, he's still struggling to be more positive and achieve his goals (eat healthier, lose weight, etc). I don't want to be the only person who has reached a great place, only to find that he's still stuck in such a negative place.

He was on antidepressants, but they made it so much worse and made him suicidal. I've tried to get him to go to therapy, he says he hates therapists and that they don't help/make it worse. He's had bad experiences and I've tried to ask him if we could go together, if we could at least try once, but he won't budge. I've gifted him a self-help book about depression, I've tried to give him little advices about things he could do that have helped other people, but he gets very upset and tells me ""it doesn't work like that"" and doesn't want me to help. I've tried to do the things he wants to accomplish with him, such as asking him if we wants to go for a walk with me, or I'll ask if he wants to go workout with me. The only thing I can do now is let him handle it on his own (as that's what he's asked me to do), and although he at least now has hope for himself, he doesn't seem to want to do much or believe many things will help. He hates when I bring things up like ""science has shown that..."" and gets upset. How do I get him to at least try things?

I know that hidden underneath the mental health problems is an energetic and amazing person, as it shows through all the time. He's told me that when he was younger, he used to be extremely hyper and the complete opposite, but as he got older and his mental illness got worse, he started becoming more mellow and less enthusiastic about things.

There has to be something I'm missing to be able to communicate with him more effectively. I know that you can't love someone's depression away. I'm not asking how I can get rid of it, I just want advice on how I can help him take steps to help it at least. There's countless people who have found a way to cope with their depression, and I want him to be able to too. I know it won't happen right away, but I think with small steps it could be manageable.

Thank you so much.

tl;dr: My boyfriend's depression is ruining our relationship and causing many problems. I've been on a journey of self-improvement myself, and have learned a lot that I believe can help him. What can I do to help, and how can I get him to actually try to better himself when he doesn't want to do anything to help himself?",4
"So girl I like is very flirty when she's drunk. Actually that's the reason we're not together. She knows that it hurts me and she doesn't wants that. Recently she found someone and thought he was the one, even started to avoid me I'm guessing cuz she didn't want to hurt me. Well he didn't last and was only using her and we started talking again. 

Last weekend we went out with some friends she got drunk and flirted with some random guy again which it didn't affect me much. When he left she flirted with one of my friends. That actually affected me. The weird part is that she wanted to dance with me but only in private but she has no problem dancing with some guy or even friends.

I don't know what that means. Damn it girls are complicated. She keeps treating me different idk if that's good or not. She won't text me but gets offended if I don't text her for long periods. Is she playing with me? Wth is going on?

Anyways, I've been dealing with depression for a long time. First got diagnosed with it my senior year of high school. That was also the year I got suspended for drug use (I attended a boarding school), and subsequently got waitlisted at 5 top 20 schools that I would have got into if it hadn't been for my suspension. I hate myself for it. Just finished my first semester at a random, no-name college and it was pathetic. While I work two jobs, I isolated myself, and as a result, practically have no friends left. Always wondering what would of happened if I laid off the drugs in high school and got into a decent college.

I've been depressed, anxious and introverted my whole life but I've kinda learnt to live with it.

I'm sitting here now writing this because I have no one, I feel physically sick with the way she is treating me and how once again she has abandoned me. She is fucking with me, ontop of all the bad shit that has recently happened to me. I can't function now, I feel so helpless, I don't know what to say or do, I constantly feel overwhelmed with anxiety. I haven't been this depressed in years.

"I think back to when I was a kid and everything was so colourful and vibrant and experiences were new and fresh.

I'm training to be a teacher and I love working with the kids because it gives me that sense of excitement and fun again and I can see them learning and embracing every experience with both hands but for me I don't have that and it worries me. I don't want to bumble about waiting for something to excite me, I want it now, but I don't know what IT is. I have interest and hobbies but nothing that makes me want to get up early in the morning and go for it.

Everything is so seemingly random and purposeless.  Whenever I think about my life, I always feel so out of control.  I had no choice in my existence.  Everyday life without my distractions of fantasy..through games and TV shows..is meaningless and awful, yet I must participate to keep consuming the media that I truly live for.  I work and get education in an exhausting cycle every day..for an uncertain future in a VERY  fucked up and disgusting world in light of recent events.  How do I cope with the feelings of dread that wash over me?  I guess I'll try to answer for myself.  I just keep distracting, keep consuming media that gives my life interest and purpose.  Yet, as of late even that hasn't been enough.  I need the bigger distraction of other people I guess.  I want to socialize and build relationships to strengthen my life's meaning, but this is really, REALLY fucking hard.  Reaching out to people in today's American society is like jumping off a bridge in which you'll land on your feet or face first.  As an American, superficial and acquaintance relationships dominate.  The real struggle is to create something more.  I'm really afraid that my exhaustion will soon outweigh my desire to consume more media and the relationships I have by the time I have my BA degree.

I used to always look forward to the next whatever coming. Now I don't have that. I miss my old life. I don't enjoy having my own apartment, my own job, cats, and college like I thought I would. 

TL;DR To those who won the battle against depression, how??? And how long did that take???",0
"Hey everybody, I ran out of my Lexapro/Cipralex meds about a week ago, having an emergency appointment with the doc tomorrow. Since I ran out, I've been having these weird pulses in my head, lots of cranial pressure and ringing in the ears for a couple seconds, and then it subsides. Sometimes it coincides with movement (like getting up from a chair, but also like going up in an elevator). Does anyone have any experience going cold turkey from escitalopram? Is this a known symptom of sudden stoppage? Thanks.",3
"I've gone through deep depression in university from being homesick, in addition to being in remission for testicular cancer for over 3 years. I met this girl through a close friend of mine out of state. We met once and connected really well, and wanted to stay together even through long distance. She told me her feelings were genuine and I shouldn't worry about anything, and that she would not be the one breaking up with me.


Fast forward 2 months to last night, where we met up again, to which i feel that she may be avoiding or distancing herself for me. I would ask if everything is alright to which she would assure me nothing is wrong. I see her texting a friend at the show we were at where she sent a text to a friend saying ""I'm a horrible person"". I kinda figured what may be the case, and confronted her to which she slowly admitted that she's not looking for a relationship. She booked the same flight home with me to stay with and visit me where I live with my family.


I don't know where to go from here. I'm 22, been through physical and emotional stress, and I wear my heart on my sleeve too much. I am going to talk to her soon about the situation but I don't know if I want her coming home with me now. It feels humiliating to describe this amazing girl you just met to friends and family, only to be abruptly let down before we could actually spend quality time together IN PERSON. I don't know if i can have her come home with me, it's so heartbreaking to know the person you fell in love with doesn't feel the same and is right in front of you.



Advice and feedback would be greatly appreciated.",4
I better stop being a coward and end it. I'm scared that a gunshot wound won't be fast enough and I don't have any bitcoin so I can't order the right drugs online. But whatever. Even if it hurts this has to be the year I get the strength ,3
I really don't know what to do all I want to do right now is just sit alone with no one around me and just cry like why does life have to be this terrible why and why did this have to happen to me why am I only so dumb so stupid and just useless I don't want to be like this i hate it but i don't know what to do ,5
"I tried I really did but my emotions always seem to come back. My mom has told me that these are just ""fake emotions"" and if I press them down I wont even feel them.

"I have nobody in my life right now, and life seems meaningless because of it. I think that committing suicide is a good idea, but I want to give it a few years first until I really really can't take it anymore before I go there.

I've seen a lot of horrible stuff in my life, and I don't doubt that I will become a sociopath or criminal because of it down the road. So maybe it is better that I kill myself sooner rather than later.

I was raised by my mom and her brother, who was into a lot of trouble with both the law and other criminals. I witnessed him being assaulted four times as a little kid, and he would have shouting matches on the phone with people every night. My mom finally kicked him out when I was 11, and I never saw him again.

My mom died of cancer last July. She'd been fighting lung cancer since before I was born. We had a terrible relationship, but there were still a few good moments that can never come back now.

As fate would have it, my only friend also died of cancer last year. He was only 18.

I live with a friend of my mom's currently. She has a kind heart and gives me food and a place to live, but we barely say a word to one another.

I'm so used to being forgotten, to have promises broken on a whim. If I respect people, I want to get it back, and I usually don't. I'm seen as a cold guy with a mean face, and most people at my school by now think I'm going to go on a rampage and they steer clear of me. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I don't love anyone either. If I saw a stranger dying, I would be more likely to either ignore them or say, ""sucks to be you"" than I would to try to comfort them in their last moments. I know I'm a terrible person for feeling that way, but I know that is the treatment I would also get in that situation. I don't want to be a sociopath or a narcissist, but I feel the world gives me no other choice at times. If I start to care for someone, they pass away or turn against me.",5
"I think it's safe to say that I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. Unfortunately I never thought of depression as a possibility for me so I always debunked these shitty feelings and sadness as âjust a bad streakâ.

When I came to terms with myself and realized I had a problem, it took me a long time to open up to someone and reach out to them. I opened up to my girlfriend at the time. Fuck me was that a terrible decision.

At first she was mostly supportive but as time went on I was âtoo negativeâ or âboringâ or ânever satisfiedâ. It was almost like she completely disregarded everything I told her. It pretty much became her being mad that I was depressed.

We hit a rough patch late in my senior year and it only added onto my self hate, my stress, my anxiety, my sadness. I felt everything at once and then I felt nothing. That night I decided I would kill myself only to be unsuccessful.

She and I talked things through and when I eventually told her what happened, she didn't just put me down,  no. She called me a liar. The relationship didn't last much longer than that but of course when I left I was told that âI should have tried harderâ.

It's been half a year since I left her and I have no regrets or wishes to have her back in my life, but fuck me I hate her. I hate her so much. I hate that she was the one I opened up to. Because of the experience I had with her, J am hateful to most people nowadays.

Every day I wake up absolutely loathing the fact that I will have people to interact with. My new friendships and acquaintances are short lived because I get so agitated I leave. I've only come to learn that nobody gives a fuck about depression

Not a single person could be bothered that I want to kill myself or fantasize about how great it would be if I got in a fatal accident. There's nothing but pretenders in this world that will use my death as a mean to promote themselves as a good person. I can only see myself writing a scathing note about just how much I hate everyone before I die. 

Whenever I do that, I can only hope that it hurts everyone so fucking bad. Hurt them like they hurt me

"It's 11pm and I should've gotten back to a friend I've been meaning to talk to again for over a week, and yet I can't knowing she's probably asleep.

I go on Discord and see people talking about how college helped them form friends, and I remember how all the friends I met in college I ended up hating. And hearing younger people having good, validating social lives stings harder than I thought it would.

So why can't I be social. All this technology to meet new people and I can't commit, because my anxiety won't let me. I'm terrified I won't keep in touch with them... because no one keeps in touch with me.",4
"I don't want to die, I just don't feel almost anything, I don't know how to live.


I'm 25, never had a girlfriend, never had a real job, don't work at all since July and barely leave home.


I meet with only 3 people, but I'm really unsure if they consider me a friend. I feel like a placeholder, second choice, we don't really do anything, usually only eat and or watch TV. Except maybe for 1 who invited me to home new year's eve party but I got too anxious about meeting new people, so I cancelled.


In general I avoid meeting new people, I don't know what to talk about, I never can come up with a new topic, and especially I don't have anything interesting to say about myself. Those people that I meet with, they don't converse. They either don't talk at all, or talk and talk. Those are the only ""conversations"" that don't make me nervous, when I feel that I'm not obliged to say anything, but if I got anything to say I can say it.


I joined a gym but I don't enjoy working out, and even more I don't feel comfortable around so many people. Sometimes I'm freaking out because I'm not sure if should I shake hand with someone, or say something. When I'm resting between sets I almost try to hide and not draw anyone.


I feel intimidated by eye contact, especially with girls. Now this may sound super-stupid but recently a cute girl at the gym said ""Hi, how are you"" to me, and I replied with ""hello"" and walked away a little. In like two seconds she's in front of me, smiling, looking to my eyes and goes again with ""How are you"". Of course, I got completely frozen for long enough to make her walk away, probably thinking that I'm some weird deaf retard. The most pathetic part about it is that was the closest thing to a date I had in 2017.


I think it's a safe bet that my biggest issue is social anxiety. General anxiety would be second, and third for, I think, mild depression, mostly loss of joy?


Other than that I don't like how I look, partially maybe because of low self esteem and - very, highly, probably - inferiority complex.


I took antidepressants and anxiolytics (and hypnotics) for very long, now I don't take any ADs at all, anxiolytics in low doses and only if I really feel the need.


Sorry for my English, it's obviously not my first language. I hope it also doesn't sound too desperate, I practically rewrote whole post and added first line to make my problem as clear as possible.",4
"I'm 18(M) and turning 19 in a month time. I've been having depression since late Jan 2016 which started because of an extremely bad break up, financial issues, parents divorcing thus having to move out as well as performing badly in class.


i'll try to keep the post short and simple because I'm exhausted right now, typing this on mobile doesn't help too, especially for formatting.


Any advice from those who have/had depression would be greatly appreciated. Well, just ranting for online does relief everything in which I had bottled up.


So on new year, I just broke up with my girlfriend(4months) and connections from my close friends. My relationship was toxic as it felt as though I was the only one trying as I clinged onto the thoughts that she would be the one who help me to get out of depression. She was initially really supportive and that was why I was attracted to her, she helped me to elavate my abuse of tobacco but I feel as though I'll fall back into that sinkhole.


People change and I don't blame her. She feels exhausted and does not feel the same way anymore.


Right now I'm just really exhausted of everything.
I have scheduled appointments for a psychiatrist that was done by the SAF, Singapore's Army basically.


I don't know what to expect besides perhaps being announced as clinically depressed. Does a psychiatrist really help? Any response would be greatly appreciated. 


Have a happy new year guys, I hope that  you guys will have a good year ahead",4
"I'm warning you, this is gonna be a looooong ass post. This will probably get lost in this sub but there are a few things I really need to get off my chest. Also, I'm not a native speaker so baer with me :D 


2017 was by far the worst year of my life but also kinda the best, because I was finally strong enough to make some changes. A little backstory: I've always been pretty insecure and shy, never had a lot of friends and was pretty quite. Then, I got into a relationship with my now ex boyfriend. He has issues. Anxiety, depression and unfortunately a couple more mental health issues. I've never had to deal with something like this in my life but I loved him and was willing to help him as much as I could. Things were fine in the beginning, even though it was super hard for me. I had to make a lot of sacrifices. He was not comfortable traveling, so I tried to accept it as good as I could, even though I always wanted to travel and see the world. He didn't want to spend time with my family. He dodged every family event, every birthday and didn't even want to have lunch/dinner together with my parents. He said he felt uncomfortable around them, so I did not force it on him. But it didn't stop there. I was not allowed to get tattoos or piercings, even though he knew that this was something I've always wanted. After a few years his mental health got worse. He also has anger management issues and started to get more aggressive. We started fighting..a lot. I started to become unhappy and this is when everything went downwards. Since he didn't want to leave the house, we ate a lot of junk food. We just had it delivered or picked it up, went into my room (I was still living with my parents) and ate by ourselves. Needless to say, I've gained a lot of weight during our 8 year relationship. 


I started to distance myself from all of my friends, right to the point where I didn't have any. I distanced myself from my family and pretty much everyone around me. I was alone, but I still had him and that was the most important thing at that moment. We had more and more fights and I started to see a different side of him. He was super manipulative and made me feel guilty, even though it wasn't my fault. He twisted my words to make me look like the bad person and he started insulting me. Calling me a the biggest bitch on earth, a manipulative psychopath and a worthless piece of shit. I didn't know what to do anymore. I became more and more unhappy and - after a few years - depressed. This led to me eating even more, because I was so frustrated so I gained even more weight, which made me even more unhappy. I still stayed with him. Thinking that he would change once we move out (as I said, I stayed with my parents and he pretty much lived there with me). As I was still in school and he had no job, I could only wait for me to finish school, him to find a decent job he could keep, so we can move in together. At that time, I also blamed my parents for being unhappy. No real privacy was possible in our house because my parents always wanted to know everything. They were pretty much always up in my business. Anyway, he kept telling me, that things would get better once we have our own place. I believed him, or let's say, I wanted to believe him so bad. But things got worse. We fought pretty much every day and he started to not only insult me but also pointing out my insecurities and telling me, that no other guy will ever want to be with me, a fat and ugly psychopath. He knew exactly what to say to break me. He did this for several years, while I endured everything my mental health got so bad, that I started to harm myself. I felt absolute worthless. There was nobody I could talk to and I was too broken to do anything. I was stuck in this shitty relationship and couldn't see a way out. I did think about suicide but was always to scared of doing it. 


I dropped out of college and was looking for a job for 1 year. I was on the verge of giving up. I didn't see any point in continuing this ""life"". I never thought I would let someone ruin my life, who was supposed to love and support me. Then, I finally got a job and made some friends at work. I actually really enjoyed going to work and seeing them, hanging out with them and being normal. The more time I spent with my co-workers, the more I thought about my relationship and that I needed to do something. Over the course of 2 years, I tried to break up with my boyfriend pretty much every month. He kept promising to change and constantly told me that I'm the only thing that keeps him alive and if I would really leave him, he would kill himself. He wants me to know that it would be my fault and he would make sure that I would never forget this. I felt like I had no other choice but to stay with him, even if it would destroy me. Fast forward to 2017, one of my co-workers (who has mental health issues himself), became my best friend and helped me through a really fucked up time. He was always there for me, whenever my boyfriend decided to throw a tantrum and blame me. I got to a point, where I almost packed my shit and left for good. I just wanted to leave and be alone. The depression and panic attacks were destroying me slowly. 


After a while, I started to develop feelings for my co-worker and he told me, that he has feelings for me as well. No, I didn't cheat on my then-boyfriend but it hit me ""there are still guys out there, that would want to get to know me, who think I'm pretty and want to treat me with respect"". I finally decided to end my relationship. It took me 4 months. 4 long months full of panic attacks, threats, tears and suicide thoughts to make it but I did it. I'm not gonna lie, it was an on-again, off-again thing with my ex for these couple of months and again, he tried again to manipulate me into taking him back and giving him another chance. I felt SO incredibly guilty for leaving him. I blamed myself for everything that went wrong in my life. We still texted sometimes, because I tried to remain friends but I knew it didn't work. I tried it because of him, hoping it would help him with the break up. Silly idea, I know. After telling him one last time, that I cannot be in a relationship with him anymore he sent me a long message, telling me that I've ruined his life, that I deserved all the bad things that happened to me and that he will find someone better and prettier than me and will make sure that I will never forget what I've done to him. He kept insulting me, like always, but this was the finale straw. I blocked him everywhere. He tried to contact me again a couple of times, sending me e-mails and shit, but I ignored them and sent them straight to spam. I cut him out of my life completely.


Up until September, I really didn't see a point and I hit rock bottom. There were times I couldn't leave my bed because this freaking depression paralyzed me. I was scared that I was going to lose my job. I mean, my life was already a mess so why not add unemployment to it. I was done, with everything and everyone. But luckily, I had some amazing friends and my family and they've helped me so much. After finally opening up to my sister about what had happened with my mental health in the past 8 years, she was shocked and told me, that she wished she knew it sooner, so she could help me get out of the relationship. After so many years of feeling worthless and thinking that nobody cared about me, I didn't know how to react to this much love and support. It was a long and incredibly difficult way but I started to hang out with my friends more often, talk to my family and in general, tried to spent more time with them, after ignoring them for 8 years. I kept thinking about the past years and how much I've missed out because of my relationship and my depression. So I finally decided to put myself first. I started to work out, eat healthier and lose weight. I got my first piercing and even though it might not be anything special, it was something special for me. It was the first decision I made on my fucking own and for myself, and only myself. After that I got my first tattoo and 3 weeks ago, I moved into my own place. All of this would have not been possible, if I didn't have the amazing support from my friends and family. 


I'm not gonna lie, I'm still not okay but I'm a lot better. I still have super shitty days and panic attacks but nowhere near as often as I used to have them. I want to be happy again. I want to enjoy life and in order to do that, I will start therapy soon. Thinking about the last year makes me so angry, sad but also happy. After so many years of psychological torture, I was finally strong enough to put a stop to it and open up to my family and get help. I have so many things to do and so many places I want to see. For the first time in years I'm actually looking forward to the future.

"I've been on a medical/sick leave since my depression has been really bad for the past few weeks (almost a month). I'm on reduced work hours til I get better. Please, if you feel like you're too overwhelmed with work and can't work, remember that you can request for reduced work hours or a leave with the help of your doctor.

"It was not to long ago until I realised how lonely I am. I hang out with same 4 friends every time who I'm not comfortable with sharing anything because they are immature and make fun out of every little thing their is. Girls don't want to hang out with me because I'm not a typical douchebag like almost everyone. I would ask them out just so we could chat, but that isn't working out. 


With that being all said I developed this ""someone"" with who I talk to. Coming from a religious family I have grown up to believe in God, so I think I relate this someone with God. I tell all my problems and I request they would go away. My problems only got worse and worse so one night when I was on the edge of breaking down I realised I'm actually talking to no one but myself. When I actually came to this conclusion I fucking broke down pretty hard. Tears were running down my face and all I could think about is how much of a baby I am. I started hitting myself so it would go away. 


When I started to physically hurt myself I told myself it's enough, go get some help. I know the internet isn't the best place to be around in a situation like this, but there is still enough hope left in me for me to believe there is someone who can relate to me. These are all new stuff I'm experiencing since I never had problems like this. Sorry for the long post, but I actually think I'm going mental.",4

i had very much given up on feelings for people. a series of indifferent relationships and unenjoyable things had left me cold. i thought something was wrong with me, perhaps, and that i could not love or feel in love, whatever that means.

(i should mention i've had depression for the longest time (i'm mid twenties now)).

then i meet this person. they are the best at talking, we share so much in common; music, conversation, sex... everything. they're beautiful. and a weight is off my mind, i feel different about everything. i think about them all the time. i am creative again and i have feelings and the world is colourful again.

the only problem is, i know that they have to leave forever, and that my feelings are logistically impossible... there's no way to continue seeing this person at all.

we had talked about it. and i understand rationally that stopping everything right now is the healthiest thing to do... before any feelings get too strong.

but i can't stop fucking thinking about what might have been given different circumstances, though. i am torn up. obviously i didn't tell them all this. they need to be happy! and its not fair to make them feel any worse than they do... i want them to do what's right for them!

but at the same time... i want to see them again. i want to message them. i want to say all these things and hold them and see them and kiss them again :(

what do i do, internet?",4

"When I was a kid, I was severely bullied. Be we realized why, but I suppose because I could not defend myself and did respond to them with stupid answers, they would target me. When I was in high school, I had 2 friends who were exclusively school friends. They did not care to hang out of school and once school was over, we never saw each other again.

Now years later. Same story. I am not being bullied but people like to talk crap which is inevitable. So I invested time and money in this class. I was traveling somewhere far for it, my classmates were all friendly to me and joking around. Added each other on social media. This class happened to be a short-term one since the teacher was quitting. I thought these people would get close to me and since we were getting along, that they would like to keep in touch. So NOTHING! Again same story as back in high school. I happened to like this guy who did not like me in return and did things to hurt me such as not inviting me to the farewell class party or not asking me to get involved with projects out of class. Then they like each other's pictures on social media but not mine. Then I see some of them coming to my city to visit but they do not care to meet me and hang out.

So why people bother and act so friendly in class but not out of? Is it that they just want to be on good terms and earn something? Why go and act that me and them are friends and we can hang out but when I ask they are all busy? I admit I seemed a little needy. I did not put effort back in school to make friends but this time I did. I was polite, I did ask them about their goals, tried to be around and active, liked their posts on social media. Only thing is that I had a fight with the guy I liked and everyone liked him in class, so most likely he spoke nonsense. 

I just feel very disappointed. Any advice?",1

I know I can go back to my psychiatrist and all, but I'd like to know if anyone else has any ""unique"" medications that I could keep in mind for some hope and possibly to bring up with the doc. Here is a website that I found that has a extensive list of anti anxiety meds, https://www.anxieties.com/152/introduction-common-medications-for-anxiety-disorders#.Wkf3p1Q-ei4, and I've tried all of the Benzo's and numerous from the other categories that are listed.

"Hey ya'll. Hope everyone is having a decent start to the new year.

I wanted to see if anybody here had success with cutting back on alcohol consumption, and could potentially talk a little about how it helped them manage their depression. I drink too much. I know it's not good for me (in more ways than one, IBS, depression, anxiety). But I have a really hard time stopping. When I do go for periods without drinking, I think I feel better. So I guess I just wanted to maybe hear from some people who successfully either cut back or cut down altogether, and how this has affected them. Also, if you have any tips, it'd be greatly appreciated. I almost feel like I'm addicted at this point. After getting an app to track my drinking, recommended by my therapist, I notice I'm drinking like 5-7 nights out of the week. And right now I'm drunkenly writing this up. 

Anyway, I really do hope you hang in there if you're reading this and are in a rough spot, even if this isn't relevant to you. Chronic depression fucking sucks and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. ",3
"There are many things that bother me about myself, and those only seemed to have intensified and even multiplied over the past year. I would say all-in-all I will remember 2016 as the years my expectations dropped so low that it has surpassed the depths of cynicism to the point that I feel no different than a (barely) sentient robot. 
2016 is also the year I managed to grow disgusted with the world by the realization that everything in the modern world just seems no different than a movie set, with the plastic wrapping still on and showing. I came to these overwhelming realizations while I've been stoned, and by this virtue I don't know if I can consider these realizations out right depressive symptoms or just moments of supposed clarity in the state of inebreation. All I know is that these moments stick with me through my daily life and have tangibly affected how I feel and act. Maybe I really have been depressed and these high realizations just provided rationalization for why I feel this way, or maybe this is caused directly by the weed. This makes it difficult to know if it is appropriate to make posts on here, as 2016 incidentally was also the year I began smoking pot habitually from the years onset, a habit that I had only picked up towards the end of the previous year and which also strangely correlated with the onset with this feeling of disgust. 
The year 2016 has pushed me into an uncomfortably cushy state of apathy wherein all my ambitions, desires and pleasures have fizzled away. Out of the many undesired changes I've experienced over the year, my apathy has kept me from remembering every detail that I've conceived, but one that really stuck out to me happened last night during an attempt to reconnect with a friend who was visiting my city. He travelled there with his girlfriend with whom he was spending most of his time, and so I barely to catch up with him as a buddy. Whenever he made a comment towards me, I would bypass responding sincerely and just try to go for a smug witty response. This habit has gotten worse over the year, and they're not even as impressive as they once were so it doesn't make people laugh as much to distract them from my impersonability (one of the symptoms I forgot to mention). And since I was resorting to this everytime I was addressed my friend and anyone else I had met there started realizing and ended up talking to me less. I had realized that when doing this it was mostly unintentional and it impeded on my ability to actually connect with these people. It was another red pill realization that I've unintentionally been avoiding personal connection for the past year, and instead I've just been abusing my tendency to replace a two way conversation with a smart-ass remark. Whenever I didn't poorly execute this i had absolutely nothing to say, and so I ended up staying to myself and observing everyone else have fun and enjoy each other's company, while I observed as if through a TV. At some point I started to question whether I was on the autism spectrum, something I hadn't considered before that. 
To end this thought I just want to mention that I hope 2016 has been at worst an anomaly for what should otherwise be a good life for me, and what I mentioned here, though it may just be grazing on the surface of a myriad of issues I had, should be possible to backtrack from and return to my last point when I felt content. But this year I have repeated fond memories from earlier in my life and they felt bleaker and less visceral. I'm hoping that in 2017 I can gain my emotions, humor, joys, ambitions, and personality back because this apathy is torturous. 
I hope what I wrote here is coherent and fits well enough into this sub. Cheers and enjoy your year all

"Hey People of Reddit,

I don't know if Im actually depressed, but I may be depressed at times and I feel like I could do so much with life but I can't.


Quick list of my issues :
First off the weed/hash issue.
Im addicted to this shit. I don't do it socially I do it at home at my computer mostly because im a big computer tech geek person. I get high and enjoy my time alone just doing nothing but shit..the thc makes nothing great. 
weed is my biggest life killer...I skipped high school so much in my life and had crazy allergies and always felt sick so I kind of fucked up my education only to realise in my mid 20s that Im allergic to weed and it makes me have a runny nose the next day and itchy eyes and I have asthma so I breath badly when i smoke a lot in the next couple days and get bloated and just feel so shitty.. so that fucked with my education..im 28 now. I think it fucked my social life too and Iv know this for a couple years and I don't wanna smoke but i just cant stop I hate myself its a real addiction. It makes me not wanna hang with people or go in public due to paranoid thoughts. It fucks up my motivation and ambition and i just work in a call center ( which im a top seller at ) but its such a low income and low ambition job.

I don't have many friends and I honestly hate a lot of people , in my experience I don't meet or attract cool people at all. 

I have a gf and shes so cool and so like me..shes a little bit of a problem drinker and weve been together for 3 years and have had our ups and downs. 

Im a 5'11 wide guy with muscles..I should weigh 200 but i weigh 250 and its a drag and im self conscious about my tummy even if it isnt huge but its still a fat tummy. I have issues with my knees and back ( ashritis since im 15 and medication doesnt really help much anymore ).

I used to play hockey a lot and with the boys we would go out and shit it was a good way of having friends who are men in my life but since the past 3 years iv torn my groin ( sports hernia ) twice which will have you not doing sports for about a year every time you tear it. Hockey was my life and its fucking gone and I feel like it will tear again.

On top of that i sweat a lot...even when i was 210 lbs I was sweating a lot..mostly my back and my head so my hair gets drenched walking a couple blocks and then my back sweats and it drips down into my boxers and i just gotta wear black cloths or if i sit on my ass theyll be a sweat stain.. its a huge thing in my life and it affects me very much in a lot of situations, lets just say im the only guy at work with a fan and I overheat very easily a lot..even in -20 weather if i walk like 3 blocks ill get home sweaty and im just always like wtf...imagine in +20 weather how bad it can be..I wear the same shirt and cloths almost everyday that dry up quick and are dark colors...

My gf is great she doesnt mind the sweat she is a special girl, im surprised i even have a gf like wtf. altho she has issues similiar to me i can understand how we are in eachothers life still...having a girl in ur life can be great and can also be the shittiest thing ever but once you go there you never can go back to being single.

I don't know im just looking for words of wisdom and advice maybe,..I know i don't have it as bad as some people here.. I have a good family but i avoid them...i don't rly like my dad but hes in my life and my parents divorced when i was 1 year old I think...he cheated on her and tried to fuck with her during my childhood and all kinds of fucked up shit...

Im def stuck in my comfort bubble. All I wanna do is either become an actor ( fuck theyll stop the scene and be like can you not sweat sir during the scene ) or become a rapper/sound designer but that shit involves connecting with people who just never seem interested and everyone wants to do their own thing nowadays and I feel i need a mentor for this so its hard.

I could go on and I feel i can't even explain the real issues in my life in this post.

Any advice/words of wisdom?

"I'm am minor and i called because i wanted to die kind of. I wanted to stop existing, just not wake up really. I got this very nice kind of unprofessional but really rally great women who explained that since i was a minored she had to inform my parents. I panicked she calmed me down for the entire phone conversation. She called my mothers work and left a voice message, it's 4am she'll get it in a couple hours. I don't want to face that i panicked. the second she hung up i went into the worst feeling ever. I started screaming at myself and crying my hands are still shaking, i thought i was dying. Fuck i don't want to live these next couple hours.",3
"I mean, it was both awful and great

January was the last month where I still had my old values and personality, the same goals and the same outlook. I was just an adoloscent who got through 6 months of not enjoying anything really, ignoring it, getting into a short maniac phase and slowly having it ending. Oh, and I watched the Rebuild of Evangelion movies, they were pretty awesome. 

In February however, I really lost it and fell into a deep, deep hole. I had in the first week of it vacation and for the first time in my life, I felt lonely. Normally, I only felt bored when I was alone. But this time, I really, really wanted to have people around me. And not just friends, I also started from this point on to get interested in girls and scince then, I, uhm, ""search"" (that sounds wrong...) for a girlfriend. This was suprising. 

I was never interested before in romantic relationships. I had only 2 crushes before and with neither did I want to engage in anything, so I never hit a girl. And it's very awkward to get into this when you're around 16, it's interesting, honestly. So much changed inside of me. I didn't feel weird when I got euphoric about the thought of, uhm, cuddling. Also, I learnt that I have no type. Like, if the girl's skin is clean and she's neither super over/underweight, she's fine in my eyes. 

This lead me to get into a girl I already knew since a few months. I already feared that we maybe won't get this along as a relationship. I thought our personalities wouldn't fit very well. However, this changed quickly as I talked with her about politics and she said that ""those filthy niggers and muslims need all to die"". 

This showed me that a personality problem might not be the thing that breaks the camel's back. I mean, I really doubt that a relationship with a racist could work, mostly because many people I get along with are muslims, and a few family members are, and I really am not a big fan of racism, mostly because I am very mixed and brown. 

It really took away my believe in humanity. And I don't mean the one kind people are joking about. I really believed that the world is at doom because of the ignorance and hate of many, many people out there. I didn't give myself and the rest of the world any future. Everything remembered me on the failure that we are. 

And then... I think it was on the second or third of March, I got ill. My blood pressure is normally a bit lower than usual, but around that time, it was so damn low I couldn't stand sometimes. It made me weak and fatigued, unconcentrated and dizzy all the time. I got panic attacks, about once a week. Atleast. And mostly: it gave me the feeling of never, ever, just feeling a tiny bit... like, home. It felt like floating in a weird, alien, dark and cold environment, as far away from everything you feel comfortable with as possible. 

It improved when spring started. I still remember thinking ""I am at constant pain, have no future and basically feel as bad as I could, but the sun is shining atleast.""

However, and that was the big turning point of 2016, I got medication against my low blood pressure. Basically some drops that tasted like rotten tangerines (aka it tasted real bad). They worked after a week or so. I was hitting the gym more often to improve my body situation. It was very effective.

Now, to explain how I felt after this, was kinda like a normal situation with my thoughts being as fast as in a maniac phase. It was damn awesome. I was finally again able to do conservation, I knew what to talk about, how to talk and how to be someone people want to talk with. I was a freaking social butterfly.

I didn't give a shit about what people thought about me, I've seen the worst and I knew that some bad thinking and mean looks about and at me aren't as bad as I always assumed they are. I enjoyed my life. I even got out! I played soccer and was at parties and I was shopping with others... I was never really bored the whole spring over. I mean, I still wanted a girl, but I had friends. And I got close to my coworkers, I think I was one of the more popular guys at my workplace. 

And this is shocking. I also visited in this time my old school and noticed that I really never met many people there and was not popular at all. Back then, I didn't care, but now I felt like I missed some things out when I was just surrounding myself with the people I already know. But now, I knew lots of people and made many laugh. I even got recommended to start stand up comedy once. 

But... It ended way too quick. My mom got between me and my friends. She didn't allow me to see anyone besides people she knew and she didn't wanna know my friends because she was convinced that they were garabage. I mean, she was right, but I am still extremly angry at her for her decision. She killed my social life. 

And she doesn't accept that she did this. She always says now ""I didn't forbid anything"" or ""Don't make others responsible for your problems"" or ""You can still see people we know"" or ""Just search for new friends on Facebook"". Worst part is that my dad who actually would've allowed me this didn't step into this. Like, not at all. And my sister is now always calling me a friendless loser...

But this made clear that I don't want to live with those people for a long time. I think once I find a flat and have enough money, I will instantly move out.

However, that was not the turning point to my worse. The big turning point was this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5fyp8r/what_was_the_biggest_disappointment_of_your_life/dao3vvs/

Friday was btw a birthday at work. The coworkers I invited stayed longer than they should just for the party and they were giving me a ton of alcohol, a few bodybuilding/porn magazines and a book with bad jokes. It was awesome. I really felt like an equal to people who were all far older than me. It was really awesome and if it wasn't for this, I don't think I could've stayed through the weekend. 

I think about maybe doing something with them, even though they are all far older than me, I think I will feel comfortable with this. Too bad that some of them are women and once my parents met them they will talk with me about how I should start a relationship with and marry once I am 18... Man, I mean, I never got hit by my parents. I always got something to eat, drink and to entertain myself, but they are just fucking me up emtionally and I can't even talk with them about this because they will never change. Only scream, play the victim and insult me. There is sure some bias in here, I am in the end not exactly normal with my will for independence and freedom. It's just far bigger than in most others and I feel oppressed really quick, but I really don't feel like it's normal. 

I've never seen other children being treated this way and whenever I talk with others about this, they insist that this is defiently not okay what they are doing. 

But back to topic, not all turned immediatly left. I still felt good mostly, made connections to people and was still deemed as funny and entertaining. Mostly because I am a weird guy and have a weird history with many weird things and people in it. 

It did turn kinda left tho over time. As above said, I had a lot of stress in the family. And I had no friends. And I got slower. By autumn, I was depressed again. However, not nearly as bad as ever before, really. I was and am kinda normal with a lean to a depressive episode, but I learnt how to express my problems to others (even though I never told anyone by now about my mental problems) and how to be still productive. 

And whilst it all got downhill, I am still rather high. I brought just some time ago two people in the same week to cry out of laughter. Or wait, actually, I think it were even 3. I am scared tho of this year. I am scared of going through everything again. And scared of maybe going backwards. But I hope that this year will be more good than bad. Last year was on the other side both the best and the worst year of my life. 

Oh and: I hope the year will be good for you too. ",5
"I tried, I tried and I tried but I just can't take the final step.
First with my dad's shotgun and the last two times I tried to hang myself on new years. 


 It's like survival instinct kicks in in the last second. 

I want to die so fucking bad. 

I want to be mugged and get shot after resisting. I want to die in a car crash. I want to have a terminal disease. I want to reach out for a cop's gun. 

 I fantasize about all the ways to die. But I just can't do it myself.

Am I going to be stuck with me and be miserable for the rest of my life?

Can you be a perfect functional member of society if you are depressed? ",5
"I'm under 18, and my parents are immigrants who don't believe that mental illness is a real problem/think I can pray it away. 

I'm really worried because in the past (not now, thankfully) I have had some suicidal thoughts, feelings of worthlessness, loneliness, etc. 

Sometimes I wake up just thinking, ""Why?""

I am not sure if I have clinical depression, but I want help.",4
"I'm suffering depression and anxiety, and I'm just ... sick of it. I was doing well, hanging out with my dad ... then my friend asked me how work was going and I just started crying again. 

This is so not me! I'm not a crier! I'm someone strong who can fucking do what needs to be done, when it needs to be done. I'm so sick of feeling weak and vulnerable. This is not who I am.

And then when I went to acupuncture today. Again. Totally fine, toddling through life, walk into the acupuncturist's office, he asks me how I'm going, and ... bam. Tears. 

I don't mind crying when there's a cause. And to be honest, I actually don't usually cry when there IS a cause. So to be crying when there isn't a viable cause ... it just feels pathetic.

I had thoughts of suicide while at the acupuncturist. I don't, usually, and I know that by putting it out there like this, there's a greater chance that I won't - I wouldn't, anyway - but ... it'd be a lot easier for me. Not anyone else, I know. But it'd just stop everything for me. 

All I could think was life would be easier if I was a crow.  

I'm self medicating with St John's Wort, Vitamins, Fish oil, turmeric and Chinese roots ... and most of the time I'm all right, but then - out of nowhere - tears.

I don't know what to do, how to be happy.",5
"I am turning 29 tomorrow. I don't even want to celebrate because there is nothing worth celebrating.  Poor, bald, fat, short, and alone. I am going to be a 29 year old friendless virgin. I have no fucking future. This morning I heard my roommates and their friends taking about how awkward and ugly I am, laughing hysterically. Just a fucking worthless shitty year. I used to look at posts like this and think, I have time. Things will be better when I get to that point, that age. They are not. It is the 29th year of unmitigated failures. I don't want to be here any more.",1
"I don't want to work, I don't want to travel, I don't want to go back to college, learn new things, go out, meet people, date, exercise, cook, read books, write, eat, or anything else. I have nothing to live for and I don't think that's going to change. 

The only thing I can honestly say I want to do is to be dead.",2

"I'm a 20 year old male college student.  Before college and the year and a half hell I've been living in, I always felt like happiness did not come easily to me.  I recognized early on that unlike my friends, I had to actively work for any semblance of happiness and peace.  Once I started college, my old friend sexual performance anxiety came back full force and hasn't left.  Being at one of the nations biggest party schools and mecca for beautiful girls my age, feeling left out of the one thing that all human cultures around the world share feels bad man.  This has created a gaping hole inside me that I fill with booze and pot.  I've been at rock bottom for a while now, and I know that recovering from this depression and involuntary celibacy will be the hardest battle I've yet to fight in my life.  I feel like a morbidly obese person who has to lose 300 lbs but hasn't started yet.  Everyone who loves me encourages me to fix my life, but looking at life, society, and the human condition from rock bottom changes you.  After you tell yourself you'd rather be dead a certain amount of times, your outlook on life and the universe as a whole really does drastically change.  When I look into my future, I see years of battling this dark and disparaging side of me.  Why do I have to work so hard to subject myself to the daily delusion of being a human being in the modern world?",3
My brain is maybe telling different but I can't believe it. I don't believe that anybody on this world can be real friends with me. Maybe some do but I can't trust in it. I can't trust anybody and nothing.,4

"I'm 26, all my friends are either happily in relationships or married and I'm the only single one in the group and have been for a while and it's been a long running joke amongst us. So much so that one of them tagged me in a Facebook post this morning that said âguess who's not getting a kiss on New Years.â I was the only one they tagged in it. 

Do you know how that feels? To have your fucking day ruined before you even get out of bed? It feels pretty goddamn amazing when you've been numb to everything for a while.

Later on I had plans fall through with some engaged friends who decided they'd rather spend the evening together just the two of them. Okay, that's fine, I understand they don't get much time together because of work but don't agree to make plans with me then decide last minute to change your mind. Especially on a night like tonight.

What else happened? Oh yeah.

I even asked the girl I'm interested in if she felt like doing something with me tonight after she got of work. What was her response? 

âI don't.â

Wow, fucking 3 for 3. I'm batting a thousand today in the âno one wants you aroundâ category.

So now I'm laying in bed, it's an hour and six minutes into 2018 where I live. I've been laying in bed for 4 hours listening to the soft whirring of the ceiling fan do a shitty job of drowning out the sounds of fireworks in the distance representative of people having a memorable evening with their friends and families. 

And I'm just laying here. With this pain in my chest where I think my heart is supposed to be. There's just a hole there. 

If I try to talk to anyone about it all I hear is âit'll happen somedayâ or some other bullshit disguised as encouragement from the people in my life who have never had to go through this because they're happier than they've ever thought they could be. 

If my friends were listening I'd say I'm sorry that I'm being such a fucking rain cloud in your beautiful blue sky of a life, but fuck all of you, you don't understand what it's like to be me. You don't know what it's like to be in so much emotional pain all the time to the point where you can't even cry to maybe make yourself feel better because of everything being so piled up inside of you that you can't form a single tear. Fuck you. Fuck all of you. I love you all but it kills me to know what you have that I have envied for so long to call my own, if I'll ever even have the capability to sustain something like that with how black and empty I've become watching you all with smiles on your faces every single goddamn day knowing that I can't feel the same way.",4
"My finals were coming up. I screwed them. I passed somwhow. I was depressed. I had a hard time explaining why I was like this to my family and friends. I wanted him. He didn't. I started cutting my arm and all, hoping he'd get sympathetic and stay with me. I didn't care what the reason was. Love or whatever. I just wanted. Him. 

Things happened. And we broke up. I was with another guy. I thought that would just be a rebound thing but right now, almost three and a half years later, we're still going strong. 
That chapter of my life was over. I was happier. But it took almost a year and a half to completely get over him. My ex. 

Down to reason 2 Now. 
2.  Moving away for college. I thought that's just the change that I needed in life but I was wrong. I hated it there in college. It was so lonely. I had Friends. But no one to actually hang out with. I was alone. Wanting to go back home where everything was familiar. But that wasn't possible. I tried taking with my mom and dad. But they wouldn't listen. So I asked stuck. I wasn't doing good in class. I was trying. I got better in classes. But mentally iy was hard. 

Then came pleurisy. A lung condition. And a sudden attack of asthma. Pericarditis. And some other minor things. 
Sick and alone. I started getting bitter. Negativity surrounded Me. Life seemed useless. There was nothing to look forward to.  Nothing to live for. I had friends and family and a significant other who loved me a lot and I loved him back. But none of that seemed important enough to live for. 
I tried taking to him. Explaining why I was acting the way I was but I guess after sometime he got fed up. He understood me but not too well.  

To him it was like me making negativity and sadness a hobby. But that wasn't the case. He tried. He really tried all that he could. But I was in too deep. He told me to force myself to be happy, think happy and be happy, but it's not so easy you know?

You'll only know how it is if you feel it yourself. 
I was stuck. I started cutting my arm and taking high doses of whatever Med I could find and sleeping pills. I wanted to sleep forever. To die. I started planning and plotting the best ways to die painlessly.  I was a wimp, a pussy. I wanted to die but I was too chicken to actually do it. 
I walked out In the middle of the night multiple times wandering around aimlessly trying to clear my mind, to make a decision. It was useless. I wanted to walk up in front of a car or a bus and get hit and die. I tried that. I got scared and never succeeded. 


Now a year later, when my medical conditions are fine and I finally thought I was over it all. I started feeling sad one again last night. Like life was meaningless.  Nothing to look forward too. 

I want to die
Again

I'm scared that everything will change in the future. Nothing will be the same. I'm not the kind of person that can look forward to the future. I want to cling on to the past I don't know why. 

I'm sad

I'm stupid and useless and overly emotional. 


Should I do it? ",3
Im so fucked. I have anxiety to the point i feel i have paranoia and it leads to depression. And i just wanna be normal for once. I wanna actually live. Instead of constantly think about the bad about myself and how horrible i am. What can help me? Therapy? Meds? Can you guys help me out?,5
"I was taking 40mg Celexa for Anxiety disorder. It wasn't working so well so my Psychiatrist put me on Effexor. Here was his tapering off plan:

1st week: 30mg Celexa &amp; 37.5 Effexor

2nd &amp; 3rd week: 20mg Celexa &amp; 75mg effexor

4th week: 10mg Celexa &amp; 150mg Effexor

5th week: Psychiatrist appointment

Now, i'm on week 3 taking 20mg Celexa &amp; 75mg Effexor and i'm starting to get very depressed. I am not having suicidal thoughts and if i did i would go straight to the ER. But i am having depression. So my question is, should i keep on pushing through ? Go back to 30mg Celexa &amp; 37.5mg Effexor ? Start 10mg Celexa (Maybe stay on 20mg) &amp; 150mg Effexor a couple days early to get a higher dose of Effexor in my system ? 


It's strange because my anxiety hasn't been bad since starting.

"I care strongly about the truth. I don't care how depressing and unwanted it is. People get very emotional when I talk about subjects and I can't seem to explain to them that the concepts have nothing related to them, it's all about the idea. I need someone to relate to",5
"Just to give some background, I've felt pretty depressed for most of my adult/adolescent life (I'm 21 now) but have never felt able to talk to anyone about it (not even family or close friends).  I have days where I'm in a slightly more positive mood, but generally I just feel pretty apathetic about everything, lethargic and extremely self-critical to the point where it stops me doing things.  I don't really have physical symptoms but being this low obviously causes me to neglect my health quite a bit.  My environment and lifestyle certainly have an impact; I recently moved in with my aunt who has very little understanding of depression (and just emotions generally), and I'm living in a place where I don't really know anyone.

Anyway I took an NHS depression self-assessment recently and the results suggested that I should go and see my GP.  However, I'm seriously doubting whether to do it, I feel like I'd just be a waste of their time.  Besides I know that there's a chance that they might suggest taking anti-depressants, and I'm a little reluctant about that given everything that I've heard and read about them and their side effects.  

Sorry for the long post, guess I just needed to vent, but any advice would be really appreciated.",5
"First off I don't really have a reason to be depressed as such. I've got friends, a good job, a wife, and two wonderful dogs. However I still can't help but feel low as hell quite often. Somedays nothing seems worth it and I feel like I'm trapped in this life because leaving being my career for something I enjoy is pointless. 
I have several passions such as writting, video games, and cars. Butbi am not good at any of these things so it just ultimately seems ridiculous. I feel bad for my wife because I am extremely bad at expressing any emotion and mostly just hang out somewhere in the middle instead of being excited or supportive.

I've felt like I'm a bit off for a long time but I have avoided seeking any help out of shame or fear. My job won't allow for me to seek mental help without transferring me and I've always been rather prideful. I don't even feel comfortable talking to my wife about it and any childhood friends are thousands of miles away at this point.

However, just know that with the right doctor and the right combination of medications, it will subside almost completely. If you're constantly feeling this pain, then something is clearly wrong with your treatment. Just know that it does get better. It does get easier. Brain chemistry can be a real asshole at times, but it is very treatable and you don't have to live in a constant state of suffering. Hang on to that hope. =)",5
"Hi there. 

I'm a 24 yo lady newly married to my best friend. We rent a nice house, have two great dogs (and a grumpy cat), and I have a steady job that I normally find challenging and rewarding. 

But I'm still depressed. I can't remember a time when I wasn't. 

My father abused me as a child and I've been raped as an adult (before I met my husband). Lately (as in within the last three months), I've been experiencing really weird symptoms that are hard to explain. It's like my mind is disassociated from my body and I'm a robot. I see the world through a pane of dirty glass and I'm not really in control of anything. I see things that aren't there (but I realize isn't reality), like my hands seeming smaller than usual. I've googled those symptoms and, surprisingly, depersonalization disorder popped up.

I also have a lot of anxiety (I've been previously diagnosed with GAD), and have panic attacks probably three or so times a week. 

I often (daily) have flashbacks of being abused and raped, and am easily triggered by hearing certain words or seeing certain items. I relive those horrors at least once a day. 

My husband knows of my past and is very supportive. I feel so guilty when I'm not able to get out of bed on my days off of work to do house chores and such, even though he doesn't make me feel that way. He says it's okay, but he wants me to see a therapist because it's hard for him to see me like this. 

I'm working on seeing a therapist, but I'm very anxious about it. I've seen a few therapists before and I feel like they either A) didn't help or B) helped, but talking about my issues brought up a lot of bad memories I'd forgotten/blocked out. Reliving those memories made me so depressed last year, I was admitted to a psychiatric ward, which was so awful. I don't want to be in a place like that again. 

Lately, I've been making huge mistakes at work because of my inability to focus. I'm trying really hard every day, but I still end up making mistakes. It's very frustrating when I see all my effort and hard work isn't enough.

I guess I don't know what I'm asking. I called a therapist today (after a lot of googling to find one I think I would like) and got her voicemail, but didn't leave one. I'm just so scared to tell someone these symptoms I've been experiencing because they sound so crazy to me. I don't want anyone to think I'm crazy. And I definitely don't want to be sent back to a psych ward.

Idk what's wrong with me, the past week has been the worst I've ever experienced, It's getting worse and I have to go back to school tomorrow...

I started feeling extremely alone for no reason, and started hugging my pillow and crying myself to sleep, two of the day of this past week I didn't sleep until at least 8 am...
After the first two nights I've started to not even turn on the lights, I've started just laying here all day trying to drown it out with tv (I've finished two, 12 episode anime in four days, and even read all of one of their manga) but it's getting to me now...

Just before writing this I felt a sudden overwhelming flow of anxiety (something I've not really ever struggled with) , and my stomach and chest feel like their more empty than ever, my head is about to explode... I'm about to cry for no reason...

I don't know what to do anymore...
It hurts so much...",5
"Almost a year ago, a attempted suicide. Since then, I've been on meds and doing therapy. Where did it got me? Lost all the friends I had left. I am even more depressed than before starting all this. Realised that it is just not in my head, people really doesn't care about depression or mental illness. 
So, here's to me. 2018 will be the year I will find peace. It will be the year I will stop bothering everyone with my existence. I am done trying when everyone wants me to give up. ",3
"People just go around and fill out greeting cards with such ease and comfort. Me? I just stare at them and think Do I really care? Does the person really care receiving them? 

I'm jealous of people who are able to just buy greeting cards and write some crap. It feels so empty whenever I do it like the person receiving it knows I had difficulty and now they just accept it to be nice and avoid rejecting me. I feel so pathetic and shitty that something so simple gives me such problems and anxiety. I hate myself for this stupid crap.

"I'm not one to post stuff on the interwebs like this - I apologize if I offend anyone but I always felt like it was just - humiliating and ridiculous but I'm just at that point of everything where I feel as if I'm staring down an endless pit, one foot above it.

I know I have a very complicated form of depression and stress disorder, anxiety and at times from all this go through phsyical pains and small spells where I hallucinate things in the dark from the constant paranoia and overthinking of every detail.

I'm homeless in a sense - I have no friend nor family; I live with my bf and his abusive family - they are toxic to me and just as toxic to him and so much do i want to leave but where would I go? Sometimes I wanna pack up and run as far as I can but I have no money. At one point midway in 2017 I jad two jobs and all was great till my bf convinced me to get a job at his call center company but policies changed and wages went so down we both axed it; I managed to convince him get back into a warehouse job I had gotten him back into 2016 that pays him very well but me? No job, too much debt, too much student loans so i cant go back to college nor have I been successful at jobs because I dont have much skills and well - Ive only been at two jobs long enough before my depression destroyed that.

I feel the sickness in my brain - in my body and it kills me with these suicidal thoughts (Ive atempted twice before and was inpatient once) but lied to get out with my moms help cause it was scary. Even had two abortions aithin this past year..Never went to therapy or got meds and not I feel the scary effects of all that. Like someone else is trying to drive me out of my own skin..

I havent slept much in a week and well I just sorta drifted in and out of this. I dont know what i really wanna ask or say - I just know I have no idea what to do and I think im falling apart..",3
"How do you deal with depressed parents? Should I recommend they talk to a therapist or a doctor? She tells me the only reason she lives is because of me, her son. I know if I left, it would devastate her, but I want to live in a different part of the country, on my own.

What do I do? ",4
"I've had about three interviews and a couple phone interviews and nothing yet. I know it's the holidays and no one is hiring en masse yet. But, God,  sitting around the house sucks. I miss just buying things without having to do quick mental math to see if I could afford it. I intend on joining the plumbers union, but God help me if I don't get in.",2
"And instead of enjoying the break, I want to be here less. 

I had maybe one hour of reflection all week where I felt grateful for this job. Grateful to be making $30k out of college. 

But then I fell asleep and was back it by morning. How working full time @ 24 won't allow me to survive on my own. 

Who am I kidding...making more money wouldn't let me survive on my own cause I'd still be depressed. Unable to adult and pay bills or do groceries or fix my house up. ",2
"I'm not even close to the same person I used to be. I understand that people change and that's normal/healthy but every step along the way I've just been getting worse. I rarely feel happy anymore, the only emotion I really feel is anger or hatred for anyone and anything. Everything annoys me. Earlier today I was talking with my mom and when she started saying things that pissed me off without even thinking I slammed the box of pills I was fiddling with onto the table, sending them everywhere and stormed off. I immediately felt regret for what I did but I can't just take it back. I don't enjoy hanging out or talking to people anymore, I very rarely have passion for anything anymore and I don't understand why or how I even became this way. This isn't how people are supposed to live, how do I fix my view on the world? I have absolutely no idea what to do, I just feel like I'm in such a dark place mentally. Relationships of any kind are difficult for me because I just don't care about people enough to maintain those relationships. Sorry this is just kind of an outpour of whatever I'm thinking at the time but I'm just genuinely pretty lost as to what I can do to improve my mental state. I don't know what I'm looking to get out of this post, I guess just some advice? Anything really. I'm 20/male &amp; unemployed, I don't know how to drive and my mom can't really teach me so I feel pretty stuck in that regard, I also owe ~$400 to my credit card company because of some debts I couldn't pay when I quit my job at a movie theater for another job (that I already had a start date for) and then something went wrong in their systems and I was out of a job, haven't been able to find one since so that's probably part of why I might feel this way, subconsciously? I also gained a lot of weight in the past few months after losing a lot, from 210lb to almost 160 and I'm pretty sure i'm back to where I started, I want to join the Air Force for a few years to help pay for college but first I need to get fit again which is pretty daunting considering all the weight I just put back on and my unhealthy eating habits. 

Anyway, that's about it. It feels a little better to type it all out but I would appreciate some kind of advice. Throwaway account but I'll be around for the next 2-3 days. Thanks for reading.",4
"Hi there, my gf has left me 7 months ago as I had really bad depression, I couldn't make her happy as I wasn't happy myself but I was always there for her and I though she was too. I am 25 years old now I stay with my parents and I quit my job have a beautiful son but I am so lost I can't get her out my head I think about her 24/7 all my family have her on Fb so I see everything all the time. I need to see her when we take turns of looking after our son as much as I try to forget her I can't she will always be in my life. Feel helpless and alone I overdosed on pills I couldn't cope but I want to be there for my son he is the only one that's keeps going and is basically saving my life. she has no clue what I go through on a daily basis, can anyone relate to this or just any advice, I stopped talking to all my friends I don't want to be someone just brings down the vibe everywhere I go so I have no one to talk to, thanks for taking the time to read this

"So empty. So worthless. So lonely.

When I'm asleep it's like there's a magical barrier around me which depression can't bypass but once I wake up it instantly dissappears and there it is greeting me like an old friend lurking on my shoulder.

"In this world full of wifi connection, human connection seems obsolete. I feel so alone. It's a cliche feeling, I know. Me against the world and nobody is on my side. The world is winning, etc. But I just feel so down. So so so depressed.

I told myself that this 2018 I will embrace what is real - real people, real words, real friends. And then I realized everyone around me is fake. I envy those people who have friends who stick with them whatever happens. I wonder if I could still find real friends nowadays. Just one real friend would be nice. Just so I don't feel this way anymore. 

Some will say this too shall pass but it has been weeks and it ain't done yet. ",5
"My boyfriend dumped me on Tuesday night. Yesterday afternoon I was really upset so I asked my ex boyfriend's best friend if we could hang out. We got coffee, talked and laughed about stuff and we made plans to hang out today. Yesterday night I was really upset so I asked him to come over. We got food and went back to my apartment. We talked for a while and I got really sad and started crying. He hugged me and told me that I'll be okay. I just really wanted physical attention and love at that point so I kissed him and straddled him and we made out for a while.



Today he came over and we just hung out and played cards and stuff. He said we should go for a drive which we did and then he wanted to show me his apartment. We went inside and he showed me around. We went into his room and he took his jacket off and we started kissing a lot. I laid in his bed and he got on top of me and we made out some more. He kept telling me how beautiful and gorgeous I am and eventually we had sex.

"I recently opened up to a family member that I take 2 medications for my depression (and for anxiety &amp; PTSD), and I have trouble explaining how they work for me, and how I feel/think/am with and without them.

My problem is I'm so bored of everyday life and routine and there's really no way out of it, it's how society is built. The purpose of our modern lives is to sell our hours to some company and get money in return mostly so we can buy stuff we don't really need. Any sense of community or responsibility is gone

"Back in school the only time I would get attention is if someone wants me to do something, or for bullying me. In highschool and college I find everyone just ignores me. Whenever I'm in a group of people I'm always left out and whatever I try to say something to contribute to the conversation I  always get ignored. Even on Reddit if I ask for help I'm always ignored. In class I see people socializing all the time but no one has ever, ever talked to me. I guess I'm just really ugly. I wish I could be attractive so I could get some attention for once. Any ""friends"" I made in college turn out to be fake fucks who only need me for helping them with assignments or some other crap. No one has ever asked me "" hey wanna hang out"" or "" reach this video game"" or something like that. I always had to make the first move. I'm tired of this shit, I wanna kms right now

"I've hated school all my life, but I did my best to get good grades and finish because I thought I could finally be free once I graduate. After graduating, I thought life would finally start being fun and enjoyable, I had worked so hard to finally be over with it and I was full of dreams and motivation. Fast forward 2 years later, I tried everything I could, from starting my own business to working at a restaurant, working in software development job (I graduated in Computer Science), working as a guide, acting, and every time it's the same, I end up hating my job and my life and quit. At this point I feel like I've lost all my motivation to do anything, I don't know what I want to do and no matter how much I look for a passion I can't find one. I'm currently employed and I hate my job, just thinking about it makes me want to kill myself. Everybody thinks I'm doing great because I go to the gym, learn foreign languages, play music, got good grades at school, but work makes me so fucking depressed that all I can think of is ending everything. I love to learn languages but that doesn't make any money, translation makes money but I hate it and want to kill myself just thinking about it. I love watching anime, listening to music, playing music, eating good food, seeing a nice scenery, but none of that makes money, and with no money I'm homeless, and I'd rather die than be homeless, but working makes me want to kill myself. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on how you look at it, I have a good family who I most definitely do not want to harm and thus suicide is absolutely out of the question, I could never forgive myself if I went through with it. So here I am, hating my life and wanting to kill myself every day but unable to do so because I do not want to cause harm to my family. It's like I'm in jail although I'm perfectly healthy (at least physically) and free (in theory). I just wish I was never born, I wouldn't be in this situation and everything would be so much easier. It seems like no matter which direction I step in, it sucks. So then I look towards suicide, but even that sucks. I wish I would just pass out and wake up from this shitty nightmare.",2
"The first time shit started to really hit the fan was 9th and 10th grade. My family had just moved and there was always something to bicker about. I was the only child and I didn't do fairly well in school and waking up early when my body for some odd reason decides to default to sleeping like a backwards human being didn't help either. It was the first time I had heard about all of my symptoms being that of someone with ""depression."" Mental illness is not a universally/well-spoken about topic where my parents came from so naturally came the ""How can you be so lazy, how can you get such bad grades when we're trying so hard to put a plate of food in front of you."" 

Things got worse when I dove into self-harm because at the very least it was some kind of relief. My family doctor found out accidentally while giving me a regular health check up. I was interviewed and I could feel my doctor's spite. The anger resonated with my mother and she reacted in anger saying: ""I don't know why she even does that!"" And came the car ride, ""If you hate your life so much why don't you just die."" 

And I almost believed that she meant that and I spent hours crying on the kitchen floor. My mother is the only person I can usually trust, I felt like what was even the point. 

Before we left the doctor's office I was threatened to go see someone and that there would be an issue if they found out I didn't schedule for one. My mom and I both sat in the car and she bargained with me explaining that if I were to go to a therapist, they'd mark my records as a mentally ill person and that I'd never find a job. 

After that I tried my best to cope with it. But then I broke one day. I was having an argument with my mother and it was the first time ever she had physically smacked me across the face. I was mortified and I broke down in my closet. It was the first time I had felt unable to control my own body. It was then my mother decided to give me a listen to the issues I was going through. 

After I calmed down, I explained to her what depression really was and how it feels and what I can and can't do sometimes. She sympathized with me but I didn't think about therapy after that. I told myself I'd eventually go. 

I'm a 3rd year into college now and it's over break. I'm not feeling the best, but better than I have since the past several months. I want to seek help while I can before I fall into another slump.

I'm honestly really nervous. I don't know what to expect and how things will go.",4

Fuck the education system and fuck myself for not being able to pass.",2
"Seriously. I am literally doing better externally than I ever have, and yet there is always this hole in me. I have eight months off of drugs and alcohol, if I do either I'll spend at least six months in jail, but I want to so fucking bad. Just to feel anything at all. I'm so fucking undesirable as a person that I push everyone away. The meds don't work. I don't like anything anymore. I just have to stand and smile as everything I cherish leaves me.

"Hey anyone that would like to offer some advice, I just turned 16, a little backstory to help understand me My relationship with my dad is dysfunctional, (he's really like bipolar and makes everything my fault somehow) I have pretty much had to stand up and fend for myself all my life, the only person that did those things and helped me out (grandad) died 3 or 4 years ago. I actually go to pretty good school, pretty talented in athletics (football mostly), I don't have very much money like 98% of the other kids in y school, and because of the amount of wealthy kids teachers are always making kids feel guilty for being white, so even tho sell drugs to help pay for myself, my moms rent, bills and tho we live in a violent neighborhood and I'm part of that crime my mom still tries to tell me I'm just a preppy kid (cuz of my school I guess, and she doesn't kno where I get the money from) Everyone acts I'm supposed to feel guilty and get that everyday, I'm pretty funny guy and really talented football player but like I said the rich kids won't have over the broke boy but we'll sure be friends with him at school!! All these tests have told me I have severe anxiety and am moderately or severely depressed.

"From what I've seen, people suffering from depression feel down even though things around them are somewhat okay. As for me, I just got divorced, my ex-wife is an incredibly manipulative narcissist, and we have a young child together. She's accused me of horrible things that I would never do in a failed attempt at full custody. I'm constantly battling her over our child. In the past she has successfully isolated and controlled me through guilt and accusations. She almost succeeded in manipulating the courts. The legal fees appear to be leaving me bankrupt. My thoughts are full of her, her constant false accusations and how to defend against them. I'm on a tenure track at a university, but that job is f-ed now because I can't concentrate on my research for longer than 5 minutes. So yeah, I'm kind of feeling down. My ex is abusive and is so good at it that the legal system and even women's abuse counselors will back her and protect her. I'm in therapy. Started going to church. Prayer helps me get back to sleep now. Trying to cut down on drinking. Exercising a lot. Still can't focus on work, so I'm now focusing on how to change careers and stay in the same area (close to our child.) What should I do? Am I suffering from depression? When this abuse and false accusations first started a few years ago, I thought about wanting to die. My career is f-ed now because of this. That makes me worry about future custody battles. In the meantime should I ask my therapist about depression medication? What's going on with me? Please help.",4
"Hei.
I'm trying to start loving myself and stop harming my body.
While I'm seeing a professional I would like to find someone who had similar experience maybe?

How to start loving yourself?
I have this huge problem where I hurt myself when someone hurts me emotionally to the point where I can't take it anymore.
I just find physical pain more bearable.
I used to cut and scratch myself.
Lately I started to burn myself with this acid pen (used to heal warts) - i just drip that acid on my skin and watch it burn my skin. then I concentrate on physical not emotional pain. 
I know I can't keep on going like this. 

besides working out, finding a hobby, reading books..
what else can I do to take my mind off of that?
is there something I could do while I'm at work?

So, I was rummaging through my folders to organise them since they're a mess. I found some things - On the left, is a note my mum mailed to me at the start of my first year of Uni as she knows how homesick I was, even though it had only been about 2 weeks since I left home. 

On the right, is a cute birthday card that my little brother made for me. (Spider-Dan is another nickname of mine) in it, he thanks me for being the best brother he could have and drew a picture of himself and I fighting against a monster whilst I was super saiyan.

Seeing these two items instantly made me burst into tears. I just sat here crying, feeling completely broken. Guilty of the way I feel and how I want to die, knowing I have family that loves me. I don't want to be a disappointment to my mum, I want to make her proud of me. I don't want my sister and little brother to lose their big brother. I want to look out for them both and be there for them.

It can be so hard to carry on. Everyday I wake up not wanting to be alive, but I don't show it. I don't care about myself anymore. However, maybe things such as this are a reason to at least try.

"Hey guys, I've been really distant from people lately, friends and family and everyone really, I've just preferred to be by myself, apart from when I'm with my girlfriend but it's been like this for a few months now. I've gotten inconsistent with training and it's something that I'd usually never skip, I'm very passionate about and I have plenty of motivation for. I procrastinate with college all the time even though I know it'll make life harder for me in the long run and I've left my diet slip. 

I really want to be the social, healthy, motivated and driven person that I know I can and I used to be, but it almost feels like that person is trapped and being held back inside of me unable to control the me on the outside. I feel lazy and sad and like I'm not a nice person to be around. Maybe these all seem like obvious symptoms of depression, and maybe they seem like they're obviously not symptoms of depression and they're something else, but I just don't know, I'd be really grateful if someone could let me know if they think I should see a doctor about depression or if they think I need to do something else. I don't want to ask people to diagnose me or anything like that, and I really don't want to come across like I think it's that easy to diagnose or anything, I just don't really want to talk to friends and people irl about it, I think I could be more honest here and I think people here could be more understanding and knowledgeable about everything tbh.

"Hi folks, it's my first time in this sub. This is my main account, though i am not a very active commenter, i ussualy lurk reddit everyday. I guess i should be making this posts in a trowaway, but i think i'll end up forgetting this one, so i prefer to use my main and i think i'll better be plain and transparent in this but not getting also too much into detail in the public thread, so i'll start introducing myself. My name is Victor, i'm from Spain and 30 y/o. The last 5-6 years for me have been utter downhill. I feel i lost everything i cared for in my life. My house, my relationship, jobs, friends... sometimes i think i am kind of a reverse King Midas, in the sense everything i touch becomes shit (again, not giving many details on public just in case, if you're interested just pm). I would really like to turn this situation around, i'd like to fix all the things that are wrong with me (and i am already working on this but its not going to be fast), and i would like to talk to people without being all gloomy or have to fake smiles. In the beginning i was capable of that, telling some jokes, faking smiles, making everyone think i was allright and break crying when i was at home alone, but recently since i moved back to my parent's this has become harder and harder. They are great, and my brothers too, but i really can't put more weight on their shoulders. Sometimes i feel like i only need someone who i can talk to, trust, be a little understood or share my feelings without being judged or told things like the usual ""you'll get better, yay!"" kind of thing.
I do freelance work from home, not earning much and not having many opportunities to meet people or pay for professional help, and i don't really know how to start getting out of this situation. The best thing i could come up was this post so you can figure out how lost i am in that sense.
Any recommendations on how can i approach meeting new people and possibly get all the things off my chest in order to regain some confidence in myself and hopefully be back on track?

**TL; DR:** 30 y/o, life fucked up, no friends, need to talk to someone but can't figure who, how or where to begin.

Thanks in advance

"I feel this might be one of the worst parts for me. I tell people no to hanging out constantly because I can't get out of bed, I work as much overtime as possible to avoid real interaction and I mask it with determination but as soon as friends do something without inviting me I'm heartbroken. I've always suffered from mild depression but I was alright until about 5 years ago bulimia snuck in. Right before my eyes it creeped into a crippling depression, but I can't even place when it got this bad. I get happy for moments and my mind quickly tells me it won't last and puts me back in my place I don't feel like anyone close to me fully understands. Yesterday I went to a party with close friends and hardly spoke to anyone. To make matters worse, a guy I used to talk to that was flirting with a good friend of mine and now I'm anxious that they think that's why I was upset when really my depression just felt like it was a good time to kick in. Which brings me to my severe social anxiety.......long spiraling story short I've only gotten out of bed once today to make a sandwich, ate said sandwich in bed and went back to sleep.

"Since ""obviously"" we depressed people are just ""helpless souls"" who need to be ""saved"" by the ""normal people"". ""Obviously"" you get to delegitimize this entire space just because there aren't ""normal people"" here trying to ""save us from ourselves"" and ""enlighten us"" and ""teach us the true way to live"". They say ""just be happy"", GOLLY GEE you think I haven't fucking thought of that yet?

Sometimes depressed people don't want help. Of course, help is absolutely necessary sometimes, but quite frankly it's none of your business to come into our spaces and tell us how we have to act or what we have to say. If you have depression sometimes you need a place to just rant. 

It's nobody's obligation here to ""solve depression"". The point isn't to ""save"" depressed people. This is not the place for non-depressed people to try to ""save us"" and feel good about themselves in the process. This is a place where people who are trapped in suffering get to scream into their pillows and maybe have someone there who hears them and understands them and maybe even responds to them. This isn't a clinic and it doesn't need to be.

Again, there is a time and a place for depressed people to receive help, but it is neither here nor now.",0

"I'm starting to think about it a lot. I have no skills, I have no hobbies and I've never been happy with any job.

I was happy with her for three years and she told me she loved me like no other then five months later is dating some other guy, I saw a photo of them together before the new years.

She was probably just using me, she most likely cheated on me multiple times - certainly once since she gave me chlamydia. I loved her so much I had never felt so safe and happy or secure in my life until I was with her and I believed she was the most amazing woman I would ever meet or had ever met.

I was kicked out of school young and I lost all my friends with that. I have been trying so hard for this past year to put myself out there and meet people but got no where. I feel so alone. I feel so sad. I am starting to lose confidence that I would never actually end my life I've thought about it since I was a child and always told myself I would never actually do it, life is full of possibilities but death is death.

I don't care about possibilities any more and death is sounding more and more like relief and peace of this emptiness.

"My anxiety and depression is preventing me from living a normal life like most people. I'm isolating myself from friends and family. Its getting worse with time, and my suicidal thoughts are becoming more and more realistic every single day. My only option left that I believe might help me is telling my parents about everything, that I never go to school, and that I'm staying up all thinking I shouldnt exist anymore. I keep telling them life is good and lying about how my day have been. It might seem like a small thing, but for me its really fucking hard. I dont think I'll ever be able to tell my parents I'm suicidal. How can I tell them I'm depressed and that my life is a complete disaster? I really need help, this is my final option.",3
"My adventure with depression started at start of middle school. I went to new school with many thugs. I am a quiet, peaceful, so I was bullied harshly - like throwing lit matches at me, laughing at my acne, once whole gym with 70 people laughed, because I couldn't make a simple exercise, dog barked when we were coming back from school and they said ""Even dog doesn't like you"". To add fuel to the fire, when I came back home parents were screaming at each other, because of my alcoholic father and financial problems. I was totally alone with all the problems and it seemed like whole world is against me.

After few months I changed school with ""normal"" people not thugs. However something changed in me. The world was dark, I had negative thoughts about myself, world and others 24/7 like ""I am worthless"", ""People are evil and want to use me"", ""People are suffering around the world"". I had nightmares everynight like I was holding injured man on apocalyptic landscape and there was an atomic alarm, on the sky there was a sign ""magnetic field can kill you"" then I woke up screaming, but the real world looked like in this nightmare. There was no escape. At start I fought with it, but after a while I accepted this dark world. I watched dark movies, listened to dark ambient etc. This lasted 6 years. I tried many SSRI's, but nothing worked. 

At the end of high school I started experimenting with dissociatives like ketamine. They helped me a little, but at the end of school I tried to commit suicide and was sent again to psychiatrist. He gave me venlafaxine and it was miracle. It changed my world in 30 minutes, color started to be brighter, mental pain wasn't there, no negative thoughts, doing things started to be pleasurable again. I mixed it with dissociatives, because there are studies linking ketamine as useful with depression treatment. Now, after 3 years I don't use ketamine or SSRI's and my world looks like heaven. I feel good all the time, no negative thoughts, have motivation to do things, colors are bright, no nightmares, normal self-esteem (while in depression I thought that I was a complete shit and shouldn't even breath, because of waste of oxygen). I want to say to you, that there is a hope.",1
Except to use the bathroom. I have no motivation to do anything. I'm on a waiting list to see a therapist so I feel like I'm just waiting for that. I've been double dosing on medication (metrazapine) to help me sleep excessively. Not sure what I want from this post just wanted to vent. Thanks.,3
"2 days ago, I called the national suicide prevention hotline. They weren't that great in helping me out. All they said was that they can only help by talking to me and looking for ways I can help myself. Like nearest clinics or facilities to get help, for groups and therapy etc. I am very depressed. I have been for 8 years. I'm 24 years old and I have lost interest in a lot of things I used to love doing. Playing the piano? Can't do it anymore. Want me to draw something? I'm a lost artists now... I can't seem to do anything good anymore. 
I don't have any friends and I'm very lonely. Last time I hung out with someone other than my family was back in 2010. 8 years ago..   no one really invites me to places, no one asks and how I'm doing. I don't think anyone cares that I exist. Now I know my family does, but that's not enough because they think this thing I have is all in my head. 
It actually is, but they think it can be cured by getting a girlfriend or something like that. I've had relationships before, even when I was still like this. It didn't help. 
It felt like I was in love with someone and knowing I'm worthless at the same time, constantly wondering why the hell this person even loves me. 
I have never went out either. I have always been a lonely soul. 
My mother gave me some self help DVD's she's had for the longest and I don't think that'll help either... 
therapist, psychiatrists, groups, etc... all they want is money and my insurance is not the best so I can't even get into that. Not that it'll help anyway. Talking to anyone about how I am or feel doesn't make me feel better.. I feel like my life has gone nowhere and it's too late for it. 
Like in the future, I'll end up dead somewhere. By my self harm. And I think I'm ok with it. ",5
"No native speaker, so sorry, if I made some mistakes.
So, I'm 16 right now. For few years my mental health was getting worse and worse. Always most people of my age were rejecting me when I tried to make friends with them, what made me really hateful person. Inside however I was disgusted by myself as I knew that only reason they are rejecting is fact that I'm somehow inferior to them.
It's not like everybody hated me, there were few people who proved to me, that they are my real friends, but I was spending most of my time alone. I was thinking a lot. World lost most of its colors to me. Everything was so senseless. I tried to do something with myself, for example I spend a lot of time working out, but nothing was working. I started cutting myself and I was thinking about killing myself more and more.
My whole life I think I've gathered around me 9 people who I was calling my ""friends"". Between them was this one girl, let's call her W. So about one year ago I've discovered that W is more important to me than other people. I tried spending more time with her and we grew close to each other.
One month ago I decided that if in three days nothing changes in my life I will kill myself. I knew no-one would cry about it, my parents for example never hid the fact, that they hate me.
In this time I had one really important conversation with W. Basically ther was one guy, let's call him J. She wanted him to be her boyfriend, but when he found out he started bullying her. He threw many insults at her, what really hurt. I should mention that she's from the broken family. She told me, that she doesn't have any will to live and she was planning to kill herself in the near future. I've said that day to her many things I've felt. I told her that she is most beautiful and inteligent I've ever met and J should be beaten to pulp for what he did. I think she felt better. Next day we were hanging out again and I asked her to be my girlfriend. She agreed.
We are together for a month now. Existence still was painful to me, but she was my reason to live. I knew without her I will commit suicide. I love her.
Few days ago I asked her if she wants to spend New Year's Eve together. She said that she will be partying with some girls, so she didn't want me around.
AND RIGHT FUCKING NOW I'M LOOKING AT PICTURES OF HER PARTYING WITH J. WHAT THE FUCK. WHY IS THIS HAPPENIG TO ME",4
Forgive me if I sound extremely stupid but I've finally convinced myself after years of ignoring my depression to go see a doctor. I'm confused as to how the process works if a person does get prescribed medication. I know there are tons of different kinds of medication so how does the doctor know which one to prescribe? Do you have a say in which antidepressants you're leaning towards? I know some of them have severe side effects so I'm wondering if after they've talked with you to inspect you if they give you a choice from a list they feel is best or if they usually start you off the bat with one kind of medication without questions asked.,3

"Since I finished high school like 4 years ago my sleep is seriously fucked up, I just can't fall asleep before 5-6am and then it's extremely difficult to wake up and get out of bed before 3-6 p.m. I am sleeping between 12-15 hours a day. Since summer I am on ADHD medication, Trintellix, and some sleeping aid plus I am trying to limit my caffeine input. The medication helped but not a lot. Some days when I have mandatory classes or lab work at college, early in the morning, I skip sleep completely, being a walking zombie the whole day and then I sleep the next night.

I have attempted to take my life 5 times so far (I will spare you details) however I have a different feeling about attempt #6.

My boyfriend and his family and some friends sat around the dinner table on New Years Eve and we talked about our New Years resolutions. When it came around to me I declined saying that what I had to say was a bit depressing. I was encouraged to talk and choking on tears I simply said that I wanted to see New Years Eve 2017. None of us thought I'd even be here to see this one. Everyone went quiet and looked away. One of the friends put his hand on my shoulder and encouraged me saying he was proud.

"Well let me very quickly introduce you to my pathetic life.

I'm 23, been in school from Fall 2012 - spring 2017. I started to have serious depression and suicidal thoughts in 2013. I have no friends, never been in a relationship. I've never had a job. Live at home etc etc. I'm a failure. 

I took a semester break in Fall 2017 because my GPA fell pretty low (2.1) and I have no motivation to continue school. I hate it so much. I'm wasting my parent's money. I haven't been doing well in school for a while and have taken less and less courses each semester since 2014. I hate myself for doing this.

So anyways in the fall of 2017 all I could've taken at my uni would be electives because I failed a pre-requisite only offered in summer/spring. The next wave of courses were kinda ""locked"" behind this pre-requisite. It felt meaningless to stack up on electives. My parents let me take the semester off to take some online courses not at a ""real"" university, but more of an online training program. It's alot cheaper than my normal university.

It's like a online thing where you get training from industry professionals in the games industry. During my time at uni I discovered modding and game development and found that I got pretty decent at it. I've been taking it really seriously since 2015. It's my dream to do it professionally one day. Yes, I know that is probably already making you cringe. I've been trying to build up a portfolio for a while and I feel like this is the first year where I've made some real progress. The courses I took where way above my skill level so I wasn't able to get the ""certificate"" but I learned way more and felt more excited about my life than I have in a while. I really think I can get atleast a remote job if I work hard enough this year. I know you can learn alot on your own, and I'm all for that usually. It's honestly been really helpful to get direct feedback from the instructors and I've learned workflows and really specific techniques that I don't feel I couldn't learned on my own. It feels like it gave my life a sense of purpose. 

Anyways, I told my parents I would go back to University after this one semester off but I don't think I can. The thought of going back makes me feel suicidal. Like it honestly feels if I go back I will end up hurting myself. I hate saying that but it feels so true.

Instead I want to spend another semester doing some more of these ""other"" courses I talked about to keep building up my portfolio. Is it a terrible idea to keep pursuing this portfolio thing? (instead of going to proper uni). I'd effectively be dropping out of college. I could always go back though, I'm not on academic probation (yet), and I wouldn't have to reapply for re-admission if I went back in the summer. I feel like it's unlikely I'll ever go back though.

I really want to do it but I think my parents would be incredibly against it. I'm going to talk about it tomorrow with them. If I'm going to sign up for classes at my normal uni I have to do so by Jan. 9. Even just opening up the University website made me start shaking and my breathing got really heavy. I really don't think I can go back.

So, am I an idiot for wanting to take more of these game development courses rather than going to proper university? Is this a terrible idea? I don't know what to do really, I feel like I'm just stuck and going nowhere in life.

"I'm a high school senior and my high school experience has been quite rocky to say the least.

It's New Years Eve and I'm in my room alone, since they were arguing earlier and I dont have any friends to hang out with.
The only thing thats keeping me going is knowing that this is the last new years eve that I'm stuck in this hell. I will be moving out next year for college as an adult. I will finally be in charge of my life and its going to be up to me what kind of environment i will be in. I won't constantly be subjected to their bullshit anymore. I will still have my issues with depression and anxiety; ive accepted that its never going to change.

"Long story short: In december I talked to my mother about how I feel and that I currently don't get my shit together; Mainly work.

First thing she did was going to my aunt and telling her and now my whole family knows and everyone is super protective and sending help, which is exactely what I don't need. When I critizied her, she started the whole ""everything I do is wrong""-bullshit and now even my father called me, who is currently in hospital because of his weak heart and told me I should start using my brain.

While I'm writing this my mother sits crying in the kitchen after she told me that she can't deal with this whole current situation and that I ""don't live alone on this planet"".

"SO i think i'm depressed. Like i feel really shitty the time and i honestly want to die. I don't know if i want to do that to my friends and family, but there's a really great girl out there and i wasn't good enough for her. I just turned 16 and i don't think that now is the time for me to leave. I haven't lived a full life yet and that's something i want to do. 

It's all about love for me. I loved that girl so much, and she loved me too but i was too fucked up. I needed more than she could give me and it was too much and she's gone and I get this feeling when i see her in my chest and stomach because when i see her she's happy and i'm just sitting here wanting to die. We still talk and she still likes me, but it doesn't help. I was too much and not enough at the same time. We broke up almost a month ago but it feels useless to try. I don't think she even loved me, even though she may have liked me a lot. If i killed myself she'd be destroyed and that's really why I can't. 

I feel really unmotivated I can't do my homework and midterms are in a few weeks but I honestly don't care anymore. I think I'm going to do everything I can to live for a while. By that i mean live as in experiences. I want to smoke and drink a lot which I've started to do in the past week because it's one of the only things I can enjoy. I used to be able to wrestle which I think would have saved me but I got an injury about a week after my breakup. I have friends that will listen but they don't hear me. All they do is give me advice on things they know nothing about and I'm sick of it. They only do that because they don't want to feel guilty. I know I'm becoming more of a burden than a friend as recently and it kills me.

I haven't really known that depression was a real thing until 9 months ago when i became friends with this really cool girl that to be honest sometimes annoys me, but she's my friend and i love her. She cut, and I honestly didn't really get it. I get it now though, and I wish I could go back to my old naive self. All my friends are naive. I think a lot of them think I'm fine now because the breakup was a little while ago and I don't like to talk to them about how I'm feeling. They're all guys and they're the type of guys who just focus on either school or girls or drugs or video games. My girl friends are the ones that give me shitty advice. A lot of them are depressed too so they can't help me as much and I get that.

I just want to feel her in my arms again. I want to feel the rush of saying I love you and hearing her say it back. I know It won't be the same, even if we do get back together because it wont be because I love her it will be because I need her. 

She's the only thing that makes me happy right now. She knows that, and for some weird reason she still talks to me and she still likes me and misses me but i know i'm not good enough. I feel like because I need her to feel happy, It means I'm not whole. I guess i'm not, like i feel really empty but even more than the empty lost lonely things is the feeling that i'm not good enough. I guess that's why i want to kill myself because i dont think i'm good enough. All i do is start stupid drama because i can't just be happy by myself. I know it's all my fault; I needed too much i gave too much I couldn't be enough for her. I'm just not a full person. I need her for my own happiness and I can't function without her. I'm so co-dependant and i don't know how anyone puts up with me anymore. 

I know a lot of that didn't make much sense, But if anybody read all of that thank you.",4

She told me that she will be there to support me through everything and even told me she liked me a lot. But I'm hesitant to start a relationship because every relationship I've been in has ended after a month at most because of the way I am and I don't want to lose her as a friend. I do feel a lot better having finally told someone about my depression and other shit. I might ask her out anyway because she is the first girl to fully accept who I am.",5
"(18/F)
My depression has been at its peak for the past two months, and I've started to notice that in addition to my fucked up sleep schedule, I haven't been eating as much.
I just don't have an appetite. I'm just never hungry when I should be anymore.
And it sucks, as someone who is actually trying to gain weight (I've been underweight all my life, I'm 5'4"" and only ~101 lb), it really sucks. Some days I hate my body, and as much as I try to love it and do what's best for it-- my depression won't let me.",1
"
I'm 18 years old and a freshman in college. I've had mental health issues for a while, but it has really worsened since about August of this year. I was actually having a pretty good summer, I travelled in Europe with my best friend, saw a cousin who lives in Germany and had a fun week in Paris. It was exciting and really nice. I miss those days. It feels like forever ago. I started feeling weird about a week after I got back. I kept sleeping and sleeping, so much sleep, but I was never rested... I felt tired all the time and always had a headache. My thoughts were really morbid and weird. I kept thinking about my own death, my cat's death, my parents' death... they recently turned 50, they hopefully have many years left of healthy life, but I'm scared to lose them. I started thinking about how life is so temporary and we're moving rapidly along a path toward that inevitable end, each day closer to a painful illness and death... and endless nothingness after that.
So I started college in September. I'm minoring in philosophy, and I'm taking this course called Ancient Philosophy. The professor is great. But the thing is, philosophy and astronomy are the two topics that really get me into these disturbing existential thoughts. We're reading a lot about death, and I wrote this paper about Epicurus' views on death (he is the one who said ""death is nothing to us""). I found it interesting. I realized that I somehow long for death (most of my problems arise from consciousness, and I find it very appealing to just go to sleep forever and never wake up, because I find the most comfort in sleep and am always disappointed to find myself waking up to another lousy day on earth). At the same time, the idea of ""eternal nothingness"" really creeps me out, probably because I can't imagine it and because consciousness is all I have ever known. I missed a lot of class and was late a lot this semester because I just didn't... see the point, I guess. Of doing anything. I thought about killing myself just to get it over with. I know how I'd do it and everything. I really think I will kill myself someday. I honestly am about 75% sure that my life will end in suicide; not any time soon, but eventually. I actually like the idea of suicide. In a way, I am pro-suicide for myself (I would never encourage anyone else to do this, but it's their choice). I find the idea of dying by suicide empowering because something inevitable and daunting is now put into my hands, and I control my own death as well as my own life. I told a friend this once, needless to say my friend was not amused and got worried. I don't talk to anyone about it now, they shouldn't have to worry about me, I just wonder if my thoughts are really abnormal psychologically or if that's rational (it seems rational to me, and it seems like people just think it's ""crazy"" because of the prevailing view in society that suicide is always both immoral and irrational).
I can't really talk to my parents about this. They don't believe in mental illness. I'm from a Syrian Druze family, but they're very secular and don't care about religion... and I've always found religion to be just a way of getting out of actually evaluating the world and confronting the absurdity of life. And I sort of have a negative view of it because of the destruction that fundamentalism has brought to a lot of people, it's close to the experience of people where I'm from, all for an irrational idea. At the same time I have always been a bit jealous of people who have religion to rely on. Like some of my Muslim friends or ones who are very Christian. They know God is there for them. I don't have anyone or anything. I don't know if I'm depressed. I definitely have been, but at the moment I'm fairly active, but my thoughts are never on what I'm doing, they're always on these existential problems and I'm almost always feeling despair and hopelessness, even when I'm acting social and trying to have a good time.
I sometimes feel that the world is not real, and worry that it will disappear at any moment. It feels that I am in a dream. I cannot define myself and others always seem like strangers, no matter how close a relationship we may have. Everything seems absurd to me. People I know from school and from my job are always are sighing about essays, exams, homework, work. To me it seems so strange. It seems like people act as though we are not mortal. They don't act like they are aware they will die. In the supermarket or something, I feel an urge to remind everyone ""We are temporary! We will not always exist!"" (Of course, I don't).
My life circumstances aren't bad, I've had some difficult things, like I lost a few family members and a friend from childhood. But overall, I should be grateful. My family has money, I've never had to face poverty. My parents love me, but don't understand me. I love them, but don't relate to them. I hope I don't seem ungrateful. I don't understand why I am how I am.

" and please, not the psycho scary type.. just someone that cares about me, willing to talk once in a while, and someone i can just count on.

"I've been told several times that it's bad to rely on people to help you feel better about yourself but I have nowhere else to turn. I want someone to hold me and prove me wrong and tell me that I'm valued and not worthless. When I'm alone, all I have are shitty thoughts and memories that tell me how worthless I am. I probably don't even need a paid professional like a therapist, since I know that I'm paying them to tell me some bullshit. I just want a simple human connection to tell me that it's worth it to stay here. ",4
"I'm the last guy people would expect. I was really well liked and social in high school, good family, pretty decent money. But right now my depression is so bad I can barely muster the effort to even write this post. I just don't know what to do. I really want to die. I should be a freshmen in college, I had gone to UMD for a month and the depression got so bad that after a month I had to drop. I couldn't go to classes, I felt alone, the girl I really loved was ignoring me, and I felt like I was living an entirely new life. I come home and it's just gotten worse, everything is hard. Everyone is doing more things than me. My friends never invite me with them, I've started smoking weed daily and I've put on more weight (I used to be too skinny). I can barely shower or put on socks in the morning, how can I work? I didn't even go in on New Year's Day out of emotional pain and now I have to work tomorrow morning and I'm sitting here terrified of what will happen. I want to end up dead without the pain, or the heartbreak it leaves behind but I'm just too scared of making a mistake or what comes after. Everyday hurts. I can't go on much longer, money is so tight and everyday just something new goes onto my plate. I've tried a million medications with no luck, I've attempted multiple therapists and ADT programs, nothing. I can't work but I have to. I haven't waken up before 4 pm in a week. It hurts. Everything hurts. ",5
"I'm taking the scientific side of the story here. Life has evolved over millions of years to adapt to anything that mother nature threw at us, and here we are, humans, in all our glory and achievements, still scaling new heights.

What do we live for? Different individuals will give you different answers, but the top dogs in history came into power for reasons that boils down to one thing, immortality. And no, not literal immortality, rather, to immortalize their name in the books after they've passed on. We all fear death, but what we fear more is to be completely forgotten.

If that is the case, then our rat race, arms race and hardwork all comes to naught in the face of entropy. It's far from now, astronomically far, but know that the universe will tear itself apart one day, not even subatomic particles will be there. This, this is a fate worse than death. All life, heck, even inorganic matter will be pulled apart. So why are we trying so hard to leave a mark in history if nothing matters in the end?

Love, life, hope, dreams... It all doesn't matter. No wonder people want to believe in religion, to escape thos nihilistic despair.

But hey, this is just science, and science is as good as human ingenuity and observation. I'm sure there are things beyond our comprehension, perhaps there really is an afterlife where it's paradise?

Wishful thinking.

Let me know what you think.",5
"This time last year, I was talking to my soon-to-be girlfriend, excited for the new year. Now I'm alone, suicidal and worse than last year. Shit doesn't change. New years resolutions don't mean shit when no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, you'll still be fucked over by everyone you trust. I hope I find the courage to kill myself this year.",3
"I don't even *know* what to say, I'm only posting here because I don't have anyone in real life to talk about these feelings with. Well, other than my girlfriend who can only say so much to help. She's a good sport about it at least and never complains about me complaining. 

I just feel very hopeless. I'm 23 and haven't accomplished too much yet in life. I dropped out of college a few years ago and honestly have no desire to go back. That's the thing, I have no desire to do anything. I don't get it. I take the medicine, I talk to my therapist weekly and learn ways to manage negative thoughts but it all feels very bogus to me. I see no point in doing anything that doesn't offer an instant reward. I see people around me who are so passionate about so many things in life but I've never been genuinely passionate about anything, at least not for very long. My interests come and go. I hear of people getting over their depression but I have a hard time believing that I'm going to just **get over** what I feel is a huge part of who I am. I have memories as far back as age 5 and even before and I always remember being nervous and anxious and having this feeling of constant impending doom. I know this sounds negative but I genuinely think I was just born with a brain with faulty code. I like computers and know that sometimes things just go wrong and you have to hit the reset button, but I can't reset my brain. I don't even know where this is going or why I'm even posting. I'm just really overwhelmed and sad and needed to shout into the void I guess. Thanks for listening.  ",5
Nice start to the year!,0
"33,m.  I went through a very hard and life changing break up last year.  Currently I live with a friend.  I make decent money, I have lots saved up, I have lots of hobbies and interests.  I've been told I'm a pretty good looking guy.  I've had a few women over the last year, but only one really stuck out.

I met this woman over a month ago and we kicked it off really quickly.  I developed feelings for her, but she just completely flaked out one day about 3 weeks ago (I'm presuming she met another guy).  

I have no idea why this is affecting me so much, but I feel really depressed about it.  I'm having troubles sleeping, I'm having crazy anxiety.  The other day I had my first anxiety attack, actually.  I'm starting to feel very hollow.  I feel like this isn't normal considering I only knew this woman for 2.5 weeks, but I just can't seem to shake this funk I'm in.

What is going on here?  Is this normal?  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get out of this funk?",4
"I am afraid that I will pass my soul cancer on to my little girl.

This fear is absolutely crushing me right now, so I'm trying to get it off my chest..

What's your fear?",5
"Because sometimes that happens to me, and I'm wondering if it's just a me thing, or...",5
"Too afraid to give people the label of a friend, despite the incredibly nice thing they do for me and too afraid to interact with others to boost my social skills in fear of them secretly hating me or knowing how weird I already am.

This feeling of depression weaving in and out of my life is slowly destroying me. After writing this, I would be fine and back to enforcing optimism...and then slowly depression crawls back again. I'm exhausted of this up and down wheel of emotions. I'm tired of feeling bad about everything. I want to fix myself but I don't know how or whether I can.",0

I have tried to ""finish"" it, but it's just too difficult.

Trying to finish the video just proves itself to be too much of a task. So I am just going to put it out as it is.

"I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression. I'm on medication. I normally see a therapist but we've been on a break for the last few months, although we're restarting today.

I feel like I'm falling apart internally. I constantly have a pain in my chest from the sadness. I've lost all my motivation and have to convince myself to get out of bed. I frequently look through the medicine cabinet and google how much of all the medications i would need to take to overdose. I've cut my thigh before and I've starting cutting my wrist, but not deep enough to scar.

The only really good thing in my life is my school. I love my teachers and my classmates, and I look forward to going.
I feel miserable at home. I feel bored and unmotivated. I don't want to do anything because nothing sounds like fun. I get really angry with people and then I get really sad that they don't want to be with me.

I've started ripping off my toenails and picking at the skin on my feet out of boredom but also because the pain distracts me from everything.

I have passions, I have hopes. I want to start an Etsy store and make crafts. But I feel like it would never work.

I'm just absolutely miserable right now. But I'm really good at masking it. I told my mom the other night that I didn't feel safe because I was so sad and she told me I'd be fine and left the room. I stayed up all night considering sneaking out and jumping off a bridge.

It's weird because I'm able to be stable at school but when I get home I feel like I'm being suffocated. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist today. I want more help. I want better medication, I want to be fixed. But I don't know what to say. Once I leave he house I feel fine and I don't feel the need to ask for help.

Nothing bad has occurred in my house. No drama or trauma of any kind. I don't understand what's happening.

tl;dr: I feel fine emotionally whenever I'm in public or at school. I feel miserable at home and frequently consider suicide and self harm. I get mood swings and alienate my family because of them. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist today and I want to be taken seriously. How do I best explain to him what's going on? How do I get him to help me?",4

"I was trying to express why I'm hesitant to accept help from others, but it's so impossible to really capture the overwhelming urge to run when people express their support for me. So, I tried to draw it instead (it makes me wish I had gotten a taller journal).

Here's a shitty picture of it: http://imgur.com/a/3wWrv

I haven't drawn in months, and only had pens, so obviously I couldn't quite create the image I was feeling in my head, but I feel like something got across. I wanted to post on here where, of course, nobody actually knows me.

Does anyone else feel like this?",5
"I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD. For a while now, I've felt like being kind of crazy is what makes me who I am and without these feelings and behaviors, I wouldn't be me anymore. During the summer I quit taking my medications and going to therapy because I thought it was a waste of time and that it was just a way for people to control who I am. Even on meds I still felt sad and wished that I could just die quietly all the time. I stopped taking them cold turkey and withdrawals hurt like hell, but I felt like the medications that had been poisoning my mind and changing me irreparably would finally be gone. I stopped going to therapy for the same reason. 
The meds hadn't been working, but my attitude about my situation led me to spend the last six months in a really dark place and I wasn't able to study, eat much, or do basic things like get out of bed or take a shower. I kept feeding into my suicidal and self critical thoughts. At the same time, I kept thinking that I was just fake sick and the real sufferers have Schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and that I was just all bent out of shape about a minor mental illness that millions of people cope with easily every day. This made me want to be sicker so that I could feel more special or like I had more inside me to be expressed. 
I guess I was wondering two things: first, I was wondering if anyone else felt like they needed their mental illness to have worth and fed into it like I did/do and second, if anyone felt like struggling with depression makes them weak because there are worse mental illnesses. If anyone made it this far, thank you.",5

However after I got done with work tonight I was extremely irritated and stressed and just wanted someone to talk to. I asked if he could come over and he took me to a restaurant to get food. I asked him if he could stay with me for a while until I felt better. We went back to my apartment and talked about stuff. I started getting really sad and started to cry. He hugged me and I told me that everything will be okay. I just really wanted love and physical attention at that moment so I kissed him and I climbed on top of him and straddled him and we made out for a while.

oh, this is not terribly unique at all.

this suffering is very plain, i see the rape that is here and i name it karma.

karma, karma, karma, for the crimes of a past life, i suppose.

what do you think? doctor. doctor, can you hear me? doctor.

each time that i die within myself i am miraculously reborn

my cells call me a messiah

this is all me, me, me, i say from outside myself

the metal exoskeleton built just for this selfish me shudders in response

its hideous, gore stricken spires scraping heaven

is the last word i think before

i am swallowed with disgust

does it not know that finally being eaten is what i had desired from the beginning?

i was hated from the moment i was conjured

there is no way to apologize

(indignity)

so, for you i have to

bleed and i bleed and i bleed out

good, good!

good luck always will run out

i feel some heart beating when i press my hand to my stomach

but it is my own

because, were i to bring a child into this world, they would surely have a tragic existence.

ah, im so fucking horny, and then i--

oh.

i scoop out my womb like cantaloupe!

sinew sticky in-between my fingers, hair ripped from the follicles

my fingers shrink inwards

eventually, bees come to eat the nectars of my spoiled corpse

buzz buzz

hum hum

cacophonous 

this song gets sung, louder and louder, until i can't control my hatelust.

hunger.

ah.

that is what it is, and i drive the lance straight through my skull

lying peacefully in a field of flowers

hands outstretched

mouth in the shape of orgasm",5
"So I am locked in my room with my parents calling me a moron and idiot from outside screaming at me and im begging to be left alone just pleading to be alone and they won't let me. I was able to tell my therapist last week for the first time in my life that I was happy. The first time in 2 years I was able to honestly say I was happy. I was prescribed adderall and it suppressed my emotions and helped me
see things logically, but my anti drug parents take it away and give it back randomly. Recently my mom took it away right after I ended a relationship with my best friend that I have known for 14 years. I have multiple suicide notes and have failed 2 attempts to overdose. This is the worst Ive been in a long time and I really need some help right now. Thank you.

Edit: This is my first time posting on here and the response and genuine care is amazing. Thank you so much.",4
"i was going to hang out with a few people who i haven't seen in a while and they all just said they're doing stuff that they âdidn't know aboutâ or was âunexpectedâ tonight. 

i asked one of my friends from work what he was doing tonight, and he's going to a few parties and gonna have a great time, and by his language i could tell he wasn't about to invite me along or anything. i would make everyone, including myself, too uncomfortable anyway. 

i couldn't stop fantasizing about all the fun shit i was gonna do for the last few days, but i guess it's just like everything else: a fantasy. ",5
"I'm pretty happy about that, I must be better than he. Probably not. Still hate my life.",5
"So to get straight to the point, I have struggled a lot since puberty with, well, everything in life in general. Socially / emotionally kind of fucked, dont really want to explain the details here. 
Anyway, I have almost no (close) friends, have not ever had a relationship, that kind of good stuff.
The only good thing I guess rn is that I nearly have a bachelors degree. The downside is that it took me a really long time to get it, AND it is not the bachelor I started out in. I started out in a Engineering degree, almost but not quite Electrical Engineering (lets say 85% EE), and I got bogged down after about 1-1.5 years. The first year I did not do all that badly (though the important major subjects I failed, but I still got an average amount of credits). The second year I did worse but still not bad enough to convincingly say I should quit. The third year I failed extremely hard and basically gave up. After that I switched to a different major which you could say is Engineering ""lite"". I also switched because in the last semester I took 4 classes, of which 3 were extremely tough, got extremely stressed overwhelmed, and thus failed them all. 
I am happy that at least I almost got a degree now. But I can't really say Im passionate about what I do now. So I do not really want to do a masters degree in this field.
Could not really say that about the first major I did either. But I still find it hard to decide if that was because I am fucked as a person, or because I did not put in enough effort, or because I truly dislike the material/subject. Now I dont know what to do. Starting all over again is not an option. I can finish the first degree but I doubt I want to do the masters degree that fits with that degree. Very stressed about all this shit.

Background on my interests: been a computer nerd since very young age. Loved it. Love hardware and software. Knew very early on how to build a computer and all that stuff. At the same time learned about how to install an OS, repartition, all that stuff and really liked it. I just developed from there. Dabbled in overclocking and other stuff involving ""tweaking"". Love all of that too. Never really did any programming though. Only started doing that in college. I kind of like it but dont love it. 
I am passionate about certain music. Puberty / adolescence were awful for me. Had terrible self esteeem issues (still to a certain degree) and it fucked my life up. Shitty consequences like Social Anxiety and probably some depression too. When I most needed I did not get the help I needed. Also, those who could have helped me did not or did not understand it.
So, I got into music like Nine Inch Nails, and it has become an integral part of myself. Trent Reznor is the first person to truly make me feel less alone and genuinely seems to be someone I have important things in common with. I love that feeling. Later I found the works of MJK. I like a lot of that too. Celldweller is another good one. I like to really dig deep into the music and especially also the artists behind the music, and what makes them tick. On the other hand, I find it hard to relate on a deep level with most other human beings in my life. These people make me feel somewhat more sane, without them I would feel even more alone.
There is probably more I could write about this but I think it gets the point across.

I also like a bit of photography (tend to go through phases with that) and I like some films / series a lot. 

I like cars a lot too. I am lucky enough to own a decent one. 

Finally I like doing some sports and just general exercise. I quite like running too especially when you get runners high (sometimes I get all these big vision of ambition success which then fade quickly after).


Can anyone relate? Or maybe a more important question, did anyone make it through all this text? ",2
"The person I love is also depressed.

A few weeks ago, they had a short hospital stay for reasons.

Since they got out, they've been an entirely different person.  Today my depression was referred to as a man period.  Two stupid little words.  Fucking hurt.

If I had ever said anything like that to her about hers, Id be ashamed of myself.  

I think she's pushing me away so I'll break it off and she can move on guilt free.

I don't know what the FUCK to do anymore.  I haven't had friends in years.  There's no one to talk to.  ",4
"Idk if I'm just more aware of it or not. But for me, some days are better than others. On the bad days, I get a sort of ""heavy"" feeling in my limbs. Sometimes my fingertips tingle, especially if I end up crying. And my muscles will feel sore and jelly-like as if I'd just gotten done with a strenuous workout. On good days though, I feel more lightweight and limber. Even more sure-footed in my walking. Like my balance and motor skills become better. I just wish it didn't come crashing down every time after a while.

Does anyone else get stuff like this?",3
"I'm a 20 year old college student guy who's never had a relationship before. Not even a kiss or held a girl's hand before. No one has ever shown interest in me before and I put myself out there online and irl. Tinder and OKCupid are dead ends, I've been on 9 first dates and 0 second dates, not to mention barely any matches on either. I'm not even being creepy, desperate, or too forward on them either, I'm just being myself. 

I often ask if people on reddit would be willing to go out with me HYPOTHETICALLY if I asked them out. Most said 'no' because I'm not their type, which I mean again, indicates that I'm no one's type. I mean, what can I do then? Am I really datable and boyfriend material?

I try to work on myself as much as I can, I go to the gym consistently and I'm in decent shape, try to take care of my appearance and dress nicely, get good grades in my classes, have a high-paying internship that pays more than some full-time college grads. I try to put myself out there and try different hobbies but I also shelter myself a little with video games. But overall, is that not enough?

People say that I'm not ugly but what does that mean? Are people blowing smoke up my ass? People say I'm just average-looking, which means that if I didn't try to put in effort, I would be ugly. I'm only average-height too, which kinda sucks. Here's me: https://imgur.com/a/6j6Zc

Average-looking, undatable, don't fit anyone's mold, perfect for no one.

What else do I have to be then? How do other people who are severely depressed or anxious get into relationships? When is it my turn? How do you feel about me? Would you hypothetically date me and why not? If you're a woman, I appreciate your input with a lot of value, whatever it is that you're gonna say.",5
"I stopped taking them about a month ago and it felt relieving except for the side effects. But I feel my anxiety creeps in again and maybe I should go back on my pills? They were not ""hardcore"" by any means, but helped ease some of the anxiety. They were Cipralex 15mg and aplarid 0.25 daily. 

Should I go back to it?",3

"I got a text from the girl i like. I'm trying not to cry, because I don't think I'll be seeing her again. I fucked up, and now i can't go back to college, don't have the money or the grades. My heart hurts guys. I'm listening to roaring tides II (it usually cheers me up somehow), but not tonight. I don't want to stop the music. Because without the music, I'm alone. I just have this hole in my heart, and I still have to finish my letter to her. I'm gonna drop it off when i pick up all my things. 
It hurts, guys. 

Make it stop",2
"Well i just celebrated new yrs eve with my family. With my parent's that will get divorced soon. With my mother that cheated on my father. With younger siblings who have no clue what's happening.
With me being closet about my sexuality. With my again uprising eating disorder. (I vomited the stuff i ate for dinner. Now i feel even more terrible. I don't want this shit again.)
Now i sit like a living cliche in front; listening to show must go on, feeling terrible &amp; unmotivated. Sorry but i needed to tell anybody.

"Ive been after a girl for awhile and she just hugged my best friend at work. A pretty romantic hug. I just blew it off and went back to work. Well actually, I went out and had a panic attack in my truck and smashed my phone. Then i punched my door and fucked up my hand. Thats when i went inside and got back to work. It was hell watching them flirt all night, and not saying anything because i was choked up. I think im gonna stop chasing her. Im just gonna stay single, and sad. Its a hard feeling cause i hate my friend right now, but i couldnt live without him. I wish i could just be happy for him. ",4
"now i discovered that my family has been reading my posts in reddit and probably tumblr and say that i shouldn't do that because ""people here are psychotics who tell you to kill your own family or yourself"" 

lol i'm changing all my passwords and i changed my tumblr url i am so pissed i am beyond pissed i feel so violated. 

My family literally is talking about me behind my back and it makes me feel extremely hurt and violated. I'm just trying to vent and help other people and everybody here and on reddit, each and every single one of you is amazing and i love you all. 

Fuck my family right now, like honestly I can't.

i once did this to my sister and i only read one post she published in r/BPD about writing her own suicide notes and planning on committing suicide, but she was burning herself and being psychotic and about to commit suicide like I'm not in that place right now but it sure makes me feel worse that my family doesn't trust me. I am not psychotic, I have a great judgement of reality actually and my own therapist said it.",4
"Ugh.  I so don't have the energy for this, but 15 people (family and really REALLY close friends of mine- my support network) are coming.

"Sometimes I just get so much confidence and hope that things will be better. I start thinking of things to do to improve my self and my situation. I read up about all kinds of different things and research places like cool bars to go and socialize. Only to go to bed and wake up feeling just as bad if not worse, totally demotivated. 

I had plans yesterday to make today a special outing. I was going to see a movie by my self and then hit the bar for the first time to grab a drink. I woke up feeling like shit as usually and just slept to 12pm. I got nothing done and just thought about suicide all day, trying not to cry. ",5

Any advice anyone can give me? Or encouragement? Or literally anything I'm so empty inside I don't even want to help myself anymore. I feel so self destructive. 

A notification of any kind would be appreciated. I hope you guys had a good new year. ",2
I don't really know how to describe myself rn. I almost don't wanna say I'm depressed because I know that clinically I am but over the last couple months the despair I was feeling has kinda subsided a lot but now I'm falling back into a loneliness. I know there's no cause but the surges of emotions I'm feeling are getting stronger and It's getting harder to bear. I just wish I wasn't like this but it's just the cards I was dealt I guess I'm ok.,5
32 minutes ago marked 15 years of no NYE kiss. :):,0
She randomly blocked me on all social media we message each other on. She was the only reason I kept going every day. Now I've wasted days in bed. I start school again soon and all I can think about is her. I really miss her. She's probably never going to talk to me ever again. I'm nothing.,4
"Seriously, just what is the point in living? I can't understand why we're all supposed to live a long life, and why the hell does anyone genuinely enjoy being alive? It just seems like everything you do is just fucking around until you die. Nothing really matters. Like all there is in life is just trying not to be miserable and one day you die. Who gives a fuck if it's at 80 or at 20, it doesn't matter. I've come to accept that I'm never going to kill myself, but what the fuck is the point if all I'm doing is just waiting to die anyway? Get a decent career or live your whole life unemployed and homeless, the end result is the same. I just can't seem to justify trying to enjoy life when all there is at the end is the same no matter what the fuck I do. It seems like everyone's reasons for why you shouldn't kill yourself revolve around the people around you: if you kill yourself you'll make other people sad. But who the hell cares? All the people who'll be sad you're gone are going to die sooner or later anyway. It's all so fucking pointless. I just don't enjoy anything this world has to offer. All the earthly pleasures everyone else seem to enjoy just do absolutely nothing for me. I can't find any reason as to why I should even bother. Life isn't beautiful, it's full of hardship, disappointment and misery. And then you fucking die anyway. Even if the bad times are really as temporary as everyone says, so are the good times. What's the fucking point? Every day is just the same fucking thing over and over and over and over until one day you physically can't keep doing the same thing and you die. How the fuck is there any reason why anyone shouldn't just give up? I'm literally only still here because the idea of surviving a suicide attempt sounds worse than just suffering through another boring day of the same pointless shit. There's no light at the end of the tunnel, unless you see death as a ""light"" and even then, you're just suffering for nothing because you could just end it all today and it wouldn't make any fucking difference. The whole concept of survival just seems so fucking stupid because all we're doing is just delaying the inevitable, whether we're talking about the species as a whole or just one particular individual. What's the fucking point in staying alive? I just don't understand.",5

"I have a friend who lives in another state (I moved away.) 

We dated actually... And he never ""broke up"" with me. He just got more distant until I only saw him like once a month. It was agonizing for me. When I confronted him he acted like nothing was wrong. I guess, in his eyes, nothing *was* wrong.

Then I decided to move away, so problem solved I suppose.

He's an excellent listener and an interesting guy, I've texted him and he's texted me since then.

Sometimes I tell him about my depression and my eating disorder, and how awful I feel. He listens patiently, gives sympathy, and makes some suggestions without being presumptuous.

But he never tells me about his life.

Even if I ask.

He has never tried to share any of his own problems with me. Ever. It was even like this when I was still dating him.

When he texts me first, it's to ask how I'm doing.

Any time I get quiet for a while, he stops contacting me. Even for months at a time. Then when I come back again, crying about my own problems, he's there to listen. Patiently.

It's obvious I'm not his friend. He tells me he's glad we met. But he only talks to me for my benefit. He's doing a good deed.

I deactivated my facebook messenger since that's how I usually contacted him. He has my phone number. But he will not use it. 

Maybe this time I'll finally leave him alone.",4

I can't tell you how many times I have called out for being ""sick"" I feel like I need time off to get on medication and see a therapist regular to talk through these times.

"Suicide is the best option, right?",3
"I was diagnosed with major depression Nov 2015, since then I have found out that I'm allergic to ssris and few other medications. I remember how I was long before I was officially diagnosed with depression and how I was when before I realized the depression symptoms set in before that summer and I honestly think that I will never be that person anymore.

Due to some schedule mishaps, I missed taking my meds on a reg day basis and I felt the same off of them as I do on them. I'm back on them to therapeutic level and nothing. I get moments of excitement but they fade away into the background. I can't think of one thing that I'm happy about. 

The only really thing I care about is my job. That's it. I do it very well.

"Long post coming ft. an overreaction of the year. Just had to vent this somewhere, wasn't going away.

So I just rece a message from someone. I had asked them to play, and they replied back with ''no hi or hello?''. It's just another one of the things I forget. Basic social rules like saying hi. Maybe it's the case that I've always been a cold and clumsy person, but I was forgiven for it when younger because of still being outgoing and trying to be positive around others. Now I can barely tell what I do wrong anymore, it just seems to be everything in so many parts of life. I'm an idiot. I've tried to be more caring but still feel so disconnected and unappreciated by others. It's not like being appreciated is what I'm entitled to. It's the contrary, and on the bright side maybe that could have its benefits too. You won't get any unwanted attention if you don't want to, you can just keep to yourself and people will respect that.

What makes me feel worse is that despite trying to connect others, I can't seem to. There's always that doubting and fear that I'm doing something wrong. Accidentally offending someone, not asking interesting enough questions, sounding lazy. Even if I change to seem more positive or confident (though no one has even pointed out that I seem negative!) it doesn't seem to make any difference. People react weirdly to me anyways. I feel like I can't even have small talk without it being noticed how awkward I am, how no one really gives a fuck, how my mind is blank and I have nothing fun to talk about. I feel like I've been contaminated and can't do anything right despite my best efforts. Almost never share negative feelings  with people either, so that's not the issue despite what this pity post might let someone think.

"Imagine a wide, empty expanse. There is nothing but the brown crust of the earth and distant mountains, hinting that something lies beyond this place. Alone, you drive across the surface, the realization of how screwed you are slowly rising in the pit of your stomach. 

You're so far from your destination that you're not sure where it is or where you are. And the surface below you is not hard; it looks solid but the weight of the car presses into what is deep mud.  It becomes more difficult to continue forward, so you shift up and press the gas to try to keep moving; if you lose the momentum, you will  get stuck. If you get stuck, you know that this is where you'll die. The car struggles and the wheels begin to spin loose, and you sink further and further into the mud. 

Mired in the bog, climbing out you see there is no freeing the car. The sun above is oppressive and harsh, the day humid and long. Echoes of voices from family or friends ring through the mind as you broil in the heat; what is real, and what is imagined? You doubt yourself and everything in the delirium of heat stroke, but you press forward, maybe out of guilt or instinct or spite. 

But as you chase the sun, it sinks below the horizon. The night is cold, and the frost twists down your spine and into your essence. You have nothing left to propel you forward, and fall, confused in the dark, exhausted beyond despair, dying in a quiet agony, alone. That's when you realize that you can't even cry anymore, as the tears freeze your exhausted eyes closed. 

---

I feel that I've come to the point of there being no win for me anymore. I can envision steps needed to meet smaller goals, but I fail each and every time I try and take these small steps. I can't progress in my career and I can't really even afford to live anymore.   Because of that I can't take care of myself properly and I can't imagine getting out of the bog; I am mired here, with no way out and I'm not even sure which way I would go. But what I know for sure: I hate what I see in the mirror every single time I glance at it. 

I've lost most of the people in my life. At this point I think that what shadow of existence I cling to will be completely alone and absolutely cannot see growing into a normal adult relationship like every other, well adjusted 29 year old. I feel that, even if I were to reach my destination, I will continue to be alone as there is no future or meaning to life for a person like me. 

It is so soul-wrenchingly exhausting to paint on a brace face every day and to try, just to be met with more failure and to have the best possible outcome also be one of failure by any societal measure. I had deluded myself into believing that the losing hand I was dealt wasn't going to be where my story ended. Well, I don't set the rules of the game. 

I want to sleep but I can't; not now. I wish I was never born, but there is part of me that wants to live, if only out of spite at this point. I don't want to be bitter or mean, and the only win that feels possible when you've already lost the game is to try and stop caring about the rules and play on ones own terms. It won't stop me longing for the night,  so the icy hand of death can snuff me out. 

TL; DR: my life circumstances dictate that even success is still a failure. ",5
"Spent all day on the phone with my family crying. I'm not sure I have the strength to carry on anymore. I've had to be âstrongâ for such a long time and I can't do it anymore.

I've been thinking about dying for a really long time. Multiple times a day, and after a lot of research I've sort of unofficially settled on hanging in the absence of a better method. 

I realized I didn't have anywhere to suspend from so that's been a deterrent for most of this (or I should say last) year.

But today I realized my door is high enough and sturdy enough to hang myself from and I've been crying all day and feeling at rock bottom so I decided to test a possible hanging rig. 

I got my scarf around my neck and tightened it to the point that my face felt swollen and I couldn't breathe. Kept it for a few seconds until my heart started to pound suddenly so I undid it.

It wasn't as unpleasant as I thought it would be. It wasn't great but it was surprisingly not as unpleasant as I had always anticipated.

This doesn't give me hope in a weird way because you'd think feeling so desperate and so hopeless for so long, the potential of ending this suffering might bring relief but I think it's more that I've lost all ability to feel any kind of hope.",5

People were coming up asking if I was okay and I kept saying I was but I really wasn't. I was ringing people up just trying to wipe away the tears. I'd stop for a bit and then start crying again.

"Hey reddit and happy new year everyone :)
I'm 18 and always had social issues but it's been more than a year that I've been falling down into worse and worse depression. The numerous parties I haven't gone to, the weekends I stayed home by myself, the pressure of finishing high school, the crap of feeling completely alone in the holidays (and on new year's) have led me to a new low.

I wanna focus on another aspect: people I try to talk to have no friggin clue what to tell me. 
My ""friends"" act all supportive until I actually talk to them about my issues. After that, it's like nothing has ever happened and life goes on exactly as usual, with the difference that I feel even more like the ""odd one"" in their eye. I actually have no clue how friends are meant to behave in general, so I might as well assume that's how it always goes and it's my fault for having such ugly problems.

Second, my parents. They think that insisting and trying to convince me to do anything and move my ass, and then getting angry when I either keep saying no or yell at them for what they say, is the way to go. I feel excluded even by them, as if I was a total freak, an alien (barely) walking around the house. 
A few days ago  up even doing the chores they ask me to do and I feel awful for it but I really feel too down to do anything at all.

About consueling, I went to one for a year (15-16 years old) but wasn't much useful since neither I myself had a clear enough idea of what was going on. Sure, he could have helped, but maybe I wasn't receptive enough haha. Anyway, I tried going to another one this September, and uh, it didn't go well at all. I felt like my fucking huge suffering was being minimized as a simple teenager thing. Well, it probably started like that, but apparently I was dumb enough to turn it into a much bigger monster :P

Anyway, I really feel pressured by life that goes on. I feel like I'm being left behind. I need to do something. Now, who should I turn to?",5
I was thinking about this today and it is a bit of a quirky unfortunate coincidence. ,4
"I've noticed that I tend to smile when the topic of suicide or self-harm comes up, or things related to those. I was in the process of a psych admission when the SW talking to me pointed out that I was smiling while we were discussing a suicide note I left in my wallet. I was just watching a YouTube video of a gamer, and the game hinted at a relative of the main character cutting herself and I smiled. Why in the hell do I do this? It's not funny, I don't find it humorous. I know it's not me being uncomfortable, because I just clam up when I am.",0
"so.. hi... im a 17 y/o guy living in southern mississippi. i have a girlfriend whos younger than me. and at first everything felt great, she made me happy. first of all some background, ive struggled with depression for almost my whole life considering i was bullied hard in elementary and middle school. the sadness strengthened its grip on my throat around freshman year of highschool because of a break up i went through, and yeah i know its stupid. but anyways after that, i lost my religion after a while and growing up in south mississippi if youre not christian youre fucked. i also eventually stopped being straight. even worse. after all this i got around 11th grade and school was fucking my life up and just making me so stressed i started having heart palpitations. okay now back to what i was gonna say before. everythings great between me and her. its just she used to make the bad thoughts go away, but now theyre back and they brought a fucking army. i just dont know what to do anymore. ive pretty much given up on ever feeling happiness again. honestly, it feels like all color is just fading away.",1
"Happy New Year everybody. I've been on Reddit for a while but didn't know this place existed. I've had depression for a few years, but in my case, my depression comes and goes. So I can feel horrible for a whole month but after feel like I'm on top of the world for a bit. One of the sad realizations of 2017 for me is realizing that there are a lot more people who suffer from depression than I thought. I'm starting to build a good support group of friends and family when things get tough, but I haven't felt there are too many groups (to my knowledge) to talk about depression, except here. Are there any sort of discord groups or anything like that that focus on depression? Maybe even YouTubers that talk about their problems with depression. Sometimes depression hits me at the worst times, so there are times where I can't really talk to people for a bit because everyone could be at work or asleep. I think it would be cool to have a place to go to to talk with like minded people that is maybe a little faster than making a reddit post. I hope I can become active in this community as well. Anyway, Happy New Year, everybody.",2
"And the cycle continues. I want a job to lower my depression. But I'm too depressed to get a job. And then I get even more depressed.

What am I even supposed to tell them when they ask why I'm out of work? I was too depressed to work because I didn't have a job, and I didn't apply because I was too depressed. I was too worried that I'd start working and kill myself within a week or a month of working.

What a fucking drag. I wish someone would just call me and say âwe have a job for you, come start, no questions askedâ so I don't have to explain myself to anyone. These degrees are going to waste and so is my mind and body.",2
"Does anybody ever get into a really 'bleh' mood all Sunday? Like you'll be fine the day before and after but that whole day you're just a different person it seems. But its not just always on Sundays, sometimes it happens on random days.

I don't think it's my job because I like my job. 

So does anyone have any ways to combat this feeling? Things they like to do or focus on to that helps? TIA

I won't do it. But I want to,5
"I feel that I've ran out of options today after my appointment with my shrink. 

I know there's always the option of seeing another shrink but I'm not sure at all that I can summon the courage to do so. 

It took years and years of suffering to finally push me over the edge to see a shrink. 

To be fair, my shrink didn't say or do anything out of line. She was courteous and patient, as usual. However as I sat there, I just felt very pointless. I've felt like this all my life, what's there to change it? What's there to look to look forward to?

I wish I could die. ",5
"[19F] 
Everything I do or don't do, I feel like such a disappointment and as if I owe my parents better. I feel like I owe my parents a daughter who doesn't have anxiety or depression. I feel like I owe my parents the right to chose who I can and can't date. I feel like everything I want to do goes back to owing my parents for my life and my home and my education. And I feel like I'm failing so badly at this obligation when all they've ever done is provide me with food and shelter and everything I needed. This guilt is becoming so overbearing and I can't bring myself not to feel it. I can't bring myself even to do little things, like make a hairdresser appointment, without their (especially my mother's) permission. Small arguments between us feel like I am stabbing them to death for their kindness. 
Does anyone else feel this?",4
"I am 25 soon and have been depressed since I was 15. I just can't see myself getting out of this mess. I used to think life would just ""work out"" as I got older but the truth is nothing has.

No dreams or goals. No pull in any direction. It's never changed. I hide my real self from everybody because I'd be labeled the sad guy if I did I make it known.

Like, what's the point of this cycle if all I end up feeling like is horrible and tired every day? I don't want this as a life.

My family don't know me, hell I don't even know me. I've got zero personality or character. Just a empty shell that plays a role.

Life is and has never appeared magical to me. I don't care about anything or anyone and I feel detached from society as a result.

I've done it all. Eaten a great diet, exercised daily, I don't drink or smoke or do drugs and yet my body hates me.

Sick of pretending. Money is everything and you are judged solely on your ability to make more of it.

I wouldn't wish this intense feeling of emptiness and loneliness on anybody. I want out.

I really don't know what to do. I've tried. Therapy, meds.

I hope I don't wake up soon. This life might not be for me.


How pathetic I'm telling strangers. Nobody else. I have nobody else.

"Really have been struggling with everything lately, and I come into work today and my boss tells my I am no longer meeting expectations and fires me.

"So being generally young (mid teens) everybody tells me âohhh your so young and cute you don't need a relationshipâ why is this? Is it so bad that I don't want to be so lonely? I want somebody to tell me âyou don't have to kill your self I'm here for you, you don't have to say this or that I'm here to listen and helpâ is that so bad? Is it bad I just want to fill the empty emotionless void with somebody who could actually care and give me the love and attention I need? Somebody tell me why is that so bad. I just want to not be alone and have to cry myself to sleep to not feel so alone at night. I want somebody who means it when they say âI love you and I'm here for youâ relationships may not seem important to you but their important to me, why is that so bad? Somebody please tell me is it not okay? ",4
"I don't have anyone to love, so I love going to the city to pick up drugs.

Maybe this time I won't wake.

Im afraid. The suicide scale is true. Its gets progressively worse and you dont even realize it. I was at 1 contemplating death and  that was it. Now as i live i keep moving farther into the scale. Not existing is all i long for. Its all i think about. Its all i desire. Ive written 2 goodbye notes. I constantly open up the lid of pills and acting as if ill swallow them. Yesterday and today i have been making nooses with a thin belt and putting it around my neck. I squeeze so hard to simulate what its like. When i do i can feel the pressure in the top sides of my head. I can feel the rush and fear. I stopped giving a shit about everything and my attention is mainly death. Someone please comfort me. I am afraid.,5
"I have a lot of interests outside a depressive episode, but maybe the most unusual is a fascination of old abandoned buildings, malls, houses, amusement parks, etc. I'm not sure why I'm into it but I think I like the mystery that surrounds it.

"Im sitting in my bathroom 1/5th deep with a belt wrapped around my neck just trying to get something out. I am generally a relatively passive depressed person. I feel like I am hyper-aware of my situation but I don't feel emotion like I should although I feel it welling up in me. 

Why can't I cry? I feel like if I could ball my eyes out I would be fine after but I just can't do it. I am usually content with my emotions but probably once a week I get this feeling that I need to coax them out to get some sort of release. It's like there is this immense pressure inside me and all I need to do is turn a valve but I can't find the right one.

I want to die. I am very close with my family which stops me, but only because I can't stand the idea of putting them through that. I understand that I am lucky to have people who love me so much but more often than not it feels more like a burden than a blessing. 

Im not super emotional that I want to die, rather i'm pretty passive about it. In my mind this seems a completely logical solution to my problems. I still love my ex girlfriend, I have self-esteem issues etc but at this point none of that really seems a factor to me. I have felt this way for a long time, much longer than my present problems are responsible for.

I have friends who are enlightened as to my situation and they try to help but everything they say goes in one ear and out the other. I don't think I'm actually going to do it tonight. My mother always jokingly said that you should always keep your house clean in case you died tomorrow. I feel that way now. There are loose ends to be tied up before I did anything definite.

It would be so much easier. It frustrates me, no it pisses me off sometimes that suicide is considered such a selfish thing. What about me? What about what I feel? Is a life lived for other's comfort really worth living?

I guess what scares me at this point is that the idea of suicide doesn't scare me anymore. I have my ideas about what might come after and I think it's eternal peace. Afterlife or not (veering towards not) I have the opportunity of eternal rest in front of me so why not?

This is the only place I can talk about my feelings, because nobody else would understand. And it's not that anyone here understands, it's that people here are supportive, whether or not they really understand. I always delete everything I post, but the odd comment, it always draws out feelings that would otherwise just churn inside of me. I'm not sure if it makes me feel better, or sadder. But they're both distinct from feeling worse.

To everyone here, who is supportive, and who has given me support in the past, I thank you. There's so much I want to say, but I'll try to keep this brief and if I really need to say it, i'll say it later.

"i ended 2016 as a recent graduate from a top notch university with a degree in probably the most unemployable field, 30k+ in debt, back at home, and cut off ties with all friends.

i predicted that 2017 would bring me a mediocre job i could've gotten in high school, that i probably wouldn't last a few months at that job, that my parents would be paying off my loans because i can't, and that i would probably stay in my room 90% of the year.

it all became true. i lasted only the training period of my job and resigned 1 week into the first full week of work. my parents' have paid 8 months for my student loans. i'm not paying rent. i'm well fed. and despite having only seen friends only 3 days at the beginning of the year then ending them off with an argument or complete silence on my end, i'm okay with it. birthday and holiday greetings unreplied to. concerned voicemails and texts gradually decreasing from daily to weekly, to monthly, to never.

as for 2018, i only predict the same. no contact with friends. me still leeching off of my parents. maybe they'll snap one day and tell me to go back to a job that i'll only end up resigning yet again because of anxiety. maybe i'll stay at the job out of guilt.

it's gotten to a point where i'm not even sad for myself. i've just accepted it. i'm just one of those examples of the ""smart"" kid growing up, following the rules, the teacher's pet that becomes unsuccessful because they only know how to live by what others tell them to do. yet, i can't even succeed in the system because once i finally made mistakes, i never knew how to cope, even up to now. and that's where i'm at. in this limbo of being an ""adult"" yet living as if i were a toddler. maybe the saddest part is my parents tolerate it.

"I went to therapy for a few sessions and the book ""Feeling Good: the New Mood Therapy"" was required reading. The book highlights unhealthy thinking patterns and trains you in how to spot them. I've found that All or Nothing thinking is a root to much of my hopelessness and causes self fulfilling prophecies. 

For example, I assume that I'm going to suck at a job and never get promoted, so I don't try hard because I view the effort as futile. The prediction therefore fulfills itself.  

I recommend this powerful, encouraging book, it's available in B&amp;N for about $12.00. It's the foundation of all modern Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that modern psychologists use.

"According to Spotify, I was in the top 1% of listeners for Counting Crows and The National for the year. That got me thinking and I realized, I only ever feel to music. Here's a few songs that I really connect with and maybe we can swap songs or something?

**Possibility Days by Counting Crows**

&gt; Now ""living in smiles is better"", you say but we carry the burdens of all of our days, so I'm scared that you'll leave and you're scared that I'll stay. It's an impossibility day, but we only say half the ballet.

also

&gt; I said, ""good night, goodbye""
Seems like a good thing,
So you know it's a good lie.
You can run out of choices
And still hear a voice in your head
When you're lying in bed and it says that the best part of a bad day
Is knowing it's ok;
The color of everything changes,
The sky rearranges its shade,
And your smile doesn't fade,
Into a phone call
And one bad decision we made.

I view that last section as the voice you use to lie to yourself, trying to make yourself feel less like shit. The former section is how I feel about friendships that shattered when they found out I have depression, or if they don't explicitly know then how they treat me on my awful days.

**The Watchmaker by Steven Wilson**

&gt; Eliza, dear, you know there's something I must say. I've never really loved you but I'll miss you anyway...

also

&gt; You were just meant to be temporary while I waited for gold. Then we counted the years and I found I liked having someone to hold. But for you I had to wait, until one day it was too late.

I've had relationships where I didn't really feel for the other person, but just kept going because having someone there is nice. I regret both of these and this song really highlights that regret to me.

**Shemovedon by Porcupine Tree**

&gt; So for a while, everything seemed new. Did we connect, or was it just biding time for you?

&gt; She changes every time you look. By summer it was all gone, now she's moved on. She called you every other day so savor it it's all gone, cause she's moved on.

I connect this song very vividly to a girl I knew who feigned interest in even just a friendship. I thought we had something and formed a strong crush on her but she started getting cold. I confronted her multiple times but she kept hold the position that it was all okay. Eventually I got confirmation that she was avoiding any conversations with only me, and I confronted her last time and just got the message, ""I'm sorry."" Now thanks to a unique name, every time I even see her name somewhere it feels like a punch to my gut. So this song makes me extremely emotional, especially the guitar solo.

**Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks by The National**

&gt; Vanderlyle, crybaby cry. Oh the waters a rising, still no surprising you. Vanderlyle, crybaby cry. Man, it's all been forgiven, swans are a-swimmin'. I'll explain everything to the geeks.

I listened to this album around when I was 12 (yet to deal with depression) and fell in love with it. This was always my favorite song off it and never really knew why. I still don't really know why but have at least kind of a reason. It's one of the few where I can bawl my eyes out to any day. Just the chorus gives a kind of soothing, understanding, almost loving feel? It's just pleasant.

Plus it live [is a tearjerker like no other and on my bucket list to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpRRRwCVsic)

I don't really feel outside of music but how about you?",4
Parents divorcing. Grandparents died some time ago. College going shit. Feeling depressed and sad all the time and when i'm talking to my friends about it they seem to ignore it and talk about something else. Please give me one reason not to end it all... :/,4
My âfriendsâ never talk to me unless I'm the only one available and I'm so sick of it but I don't want to burn those bridges cause I know it'll hurt more to get rid of them altogether than to just suck up the pain of being left out ,1
"is this a depression thing? is this a medication thing? (i'm on lamictal, lexapro and seroquel).

"*There is so much great feedback on Reddit and I'm really hoping to benefit from it please. The following is my stack and some background information.*



I saw an Adult ADHD Specialist last month and he said while I've been treated primarily for *ADHD-PI* (diagnosed by Psychologist and follow ups with Psychiatrists) it is NOT the root cause of my *depression* and *anxiety.* My ADHD-PI and Anxiety are result from my depression ...mind blown ...I've been running the wrong way for 10yrs now?!



Disappointed as I really wasn't expecting this; I wrestled with it for a bit but then finally accepted it and am moving fwd. My doctor read the report and added 25mg of Aventyl to my bedtime stack. A couple weeks later my family was worried as I was severely depressed and upset for many reasons. I saw another doctor and he doubled the 25mg of Aventyl to 50mg and introduced Siv-Escitalopram (10mg) to be taken in my morning stack. 

    

I'm a little worried as he and the pharmacists warned me about **[Serotonin Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome)**. I also have been told/read that if you mess with your brain chemistry too much it could wake up a dormant bipolar disorder in you, that is if bipolar disorder is in your family history - and it is.

    

I don't drink often (1-2 drinks a week), eat 3 balanced meals (eggs and asparagus, bulletproof coffee, protein and veggies, aim for low sugar), and jog every other day.

    

Here is my present day stack I need advice on please:

" Hello everyone, 

For the past year and a half, I've struggled with an intense internal conflict. According to my psychologist, I may suffer from a mild to moderate depression. To this day I am prone to loneliness, sleeping problems, feelings of worthlessness, laziness and my intrusive thoughts from my OCD that would never shut up. Earlier this year it was worse, with thoughts of suicide constantly plaguing my mind (probably due to my obsessive thoughts). 

This time last year (Around the beginning of the New Year) I promised myself that I would seek help for what it was that was bothering me. This time last year, I felt hope that I would overcome this. Today though, I don't feel that way. Today, I feel like I am doomed to be alone for the rest of my life, that I am not going to amount to anything, that I will not connect with other human beings as intimiately and deeply as I want to. And that is when I am seeking help. 

The most prominent feeling I have felt throughout this year and a half old depression (it's possibly older than that) is loneliness. Sometimes it feels like an invisible brick wall cuts me off from everyone else, preventing me from forming true bonds with anyone. I feel like my family and friends do not care about my mental health; my family is aware of it but barely checks up on me. My brother (who is overseas) told me that he would check up on me and asked my sister to do so regularly as well. That was five months ago, and my brother has only checked on me a couple of times and my sister has not asked me how I am doing once. Also, my mum had to get a referall to continue my sessions with the psychologist. We got the referral about a month ago and she has yet to give it to the psychologist because she says 'she keeps forgetting' and that I should be the one to remind her. That hit me hard, because it made me feel like my mental health was not her top priority. My parents also say that I can come to them with any issue, but I know that isn't true, because when I do my dad always puts on a judgemental tone which makes me feel like dirt. Also, when my brother came to my parents for help, he ended up getting kicked out of the house. 

As for my 'friends', I question the validity of our friendships. Just today I tried to talk to one friend about how I felt today, and it flew right over his head, and he talked about what he was doing instead. That especially hurt me, because it made me feel that maybe no one in this world wants to hear my problems. With my other friends, I want to tell them so badly about what has happened to me (not one of them knows I have depression and OCD) but I find it so hard to bring up in casual conversation, and I think some of them might be to immature to take it seriosly. I also constantly think about what the basis of my friendships consist of, whether they are deep or superficial. I feel most of them are the latter, which makes me question if I truly even have any friends. 

I guess what brings me here are these questions: how do I cope with all this loneliness and anguish when I feel so alienated and estranged from everyone around me? How do I connect with anyone who I feel isn't willing to truly get to know me? Am I doomed to this depression and loneliness for the rest of my life? Will I never connect with anyone in an intimate way where I can express my inner emotions without fear of judgement, because I feel I cannot even do that with my family.",3
"The past few years I've been going through some mental health changes that have become quite alarming. I was feeling generally down and had tried to combat it with exercise, surrounding myself with positivity, trying new hobbies, etc. Slowly things started to change, I was becoming anxious around crowds, I'd get flustered in grocery stores when crowded, started feeling like I wanted to avoid the gym because of people, crying became a regular thing and my family's life started to revolve around if I was going to get triggered by something negative which would send me into a spiral of sadness or anger. This is not typical of me and I'm watching it unravel in front of me. I feel crazy! I started getting into these fogs, nothing seemed to be as exciting as they should be to me, go to an amusement park? Get new camera equipment? Go hiking? I love those things but all of a sudden it just felt like they were happening around me and I was just there, just experiencing it, and it didn't feel good to me the way it should. Suicidal thoughts always accompanied my bouts of sadness, so I decided to get some help.

I went to see a counselor about how I was feeling. It was my first attempt to reach out and it went awful. Firstly, I should have mentioned that I had suicidal thoughts, but I didn't as I was ashamed of it, felt like it made me weak or that it would sound extreme. The councelor told me to stop pestering my family and that regardless if I went to therapy or took meds, they wouldn't work. That medication wouldn't work and that their therapist wouldn't have time to fit me in with their schedule and that I'd probably only get seen for 30 minutes at a time. I left feeling defeated and tried to use that to motivate myself to beat this on my own.

The past 6 months things have gotten worse. I was alarmed that one day I started feeling tired, like I was just done with ""feeling"" and wanted to die. It felt so casual to me to think that I wanted to electrocute myself in the bathtub and that it felt relieving to see a way to end this overwhelming feeling. I told my spouse to help me because I'm about to kill myself and I don't want to die, but I desperately hate this overwhelming whiplash.

We agree to try getting help again, but I put it off thinking I can try again to defeat it myself. Now, I've started getting panic attacks at the slightest hint of stress. It's like my brain is breaking. I start to hyperventilate and struggle to breathe. I've been getting sent into emotional spirals more often and again, I started thinking if I took some pain pills I could slit my throat in the bathtub.

My appointment is in a few days and I'm really nervous. I'm really sad about it because I feel like I'm crazy. I know that other doctor was wrong, but I'm afraid if this new doctor will be the same. I'm struggling so hard and I can't help myself anymore. I want to get help and I feel like I'm crazy that this is all happening because it's not me. I don't want to be like this and I don't want to have to live like this, in fear of my own self and getting triggered into sadness or hopelessness.

I don't want to self diagnose, but I think something is wrong with me. This is definitely not normal to me.

TL;DR: Can you give any tips as to handle talking to my doctor about all this? What do I say, what is important to mention?",3
"Hi everyone,
I've been lurking on this reddit for a couple of months now, on and off, depending on my mood. It's always been uplifting to read the responses to the posts.

The context of my problem is that I'll be looking for an internship in April of this year (my very first job), and I'm unsure if I can match up to the competition and impress a potential employer.

However, that isn't what I wanted help with. My problem is that when I think about my prospects, I have attacks of what I'm pretty sure is called ""anticipatory"" anxiety, ranging from vague feelings of discomfort to hyperventilating panic attacks, almost always followed by a period of intense depressed lethargy where I am unable to do anything but stare at the ceiling and feel shitty about myself. This can last for anytime between 2-3 hours to a whole day.

Needless to say, this is seriously hampering my productivity, and I'd like to ask about the r/depression community if they've ever experienced anything similar and what they've done to avoid or subdue these feelings of hopelessness and anxiety.

Thanks in advance!

"About two months ago I started working my first retail job at a grocery store chain, and everything was fine until they decided to move me to a different department that I can't stand being in, as well as changing my hours completely. Most people say that the front end isn't that bad, but it is for me. They won't let me move somewhere else, so I decided I wasn't going to deal with it, and ghosted instead of giving a two week notice like you should do.

I've been lying this entire week about going to work, and instead I've been reading books on mental illness at my public library and staying there until my ""shift"" is over. My mom wanted to know my shedule for next week, and I showed her that it was empty, meaning they fired me, but I didn't tell her that and she thought they were just giving me the week off, which is an impossibility in retail. 

I start college in two weeks, and now I won't have a paycheck coming every week, but I can't bring myself to care all that much. I noticed I've been much more reckless when driving by myself lately, too. I almost got T boned after leaving the library yesterday and felt nothing. No fear. Just nothing. 

I wish I could work at the library, it's usually quiet around there...

"Hey everyone I'm 23 years old and I suffer from severe depression. I dwell on the negative all the time and I can't get over the break up I had with a girl that was my best friend for 5 years. I would never want to with her again but I just can't help but feel remorseful for what I said to her when I broke up with her. It still haunts me everyday. She basically wrecked my life and I've been trying to rebuild it ever since. 
I have everything that you would think would make someone happy. I have a job that pays nearly 6 figures, my own apartment, my own dog, friends I see almost every day, I try to go to the gym 5 times a week but I simply feel empty inside. So far for the past 2 months all I've done is work, go to the gym, and then study for the LSAT. I have no idea what makes me happy anymore and I don't like to relax because it makes me god awfully guilty. I can barely eat and sleep. I've been a mess for a few months and I just needed to vent a little. ",4
i feel so bland everyday. i don't remember what it is like to feel happy. i hear happy people and feel jealous. i hear happy songs and they make me feel down. i told my gf i would change things but i don't know how. i feel like i'm getting closer to the end. help me plz,5
My therapist is thinking about terminating me seeing her due to the fact that im not making any progress. What the fuck am I supposed to do afterwards? Suffer with mental illness? Get medication and hope it helps? Go to a physiologist? Im confused and scared and I just want to get better.,4
I have been dealing with depression for years now and have been doing everything I can to get better. Recently I have been having suicidal thoughts. And even though I have no intention of following through I feel as though my depression would. Whenever I used to get this way I'd think of all the things I love in this world and I'd change my mind pretty quick. But now it seems every time I try to do that those thoughts get choked out by my depression. Every positive thought I have gets drowned out and stomped on by the suicidal thoughts and general self loathing. All motivation is gone for me and this point and I do things simply so I am not a burden to people anymore. I'm scared that in a slump of sel hatred and meaninglessness I'll do something stupid.. I'm not myself when I'm depressed and I don't know how to fix it.,5
"26, the only son of a proud Asian family, gay since birth. Coming out is never an option at it would DESTROY my parents, and I love them so bad. 
The main problem, I'm struggling with overcoming this ""love"" with my straight friend (For almost 3 years now, he just got married last year). As I learnt how to fake my feeling since I was a kid, I did it so well even now he still has no idea about (At least it's what I think). In the last two years I've been trying to keep the distance but still no use, the feeling just keeps getting stronger.  Ironically enough, all my life I've met so many people, but only have feeling for that only guy. Yep, the first ever, and only one til this day. Like a fucking joke, sounds romantic (if we remove the gender details) but so fucked up at the same time (as it actually is). Even worse, he sure loves me (like bro to bro). I did so many mean stuffs to keep the distance, things like replying K, being aggressive, ignoring his birthday, his new year message etc. very very mean, but the guy seems to be too patient with me, looks like he clearly wants us back to be best bro as we did before. Forgot to mention, we were co-worker for more than a year, then life happens, he moved abroad (This was when I decided to stop being nice to him - with hope of finding an escape for myself but failed :/), and later on, got married. That means there's been a real geographical distance between us as well - even that wouldn't do any good to my feeling.
It's such a shame to admit this but you guys can't imagine how many night I've lost sleep, crying all the tears I got, praying that god or any higher power up there, please erase me from this life, then the next day everyone would forget my existence and just move on. I want to die, but don't want to kill my parents selfishly. I'm tired of being alone, but then I can only fake my feeling to an extent, showing affection to a girl - that's too much for me. Would also do me no good for sure, I'm hungry for true happiness, something that can't be faked.
I still go to work everyday, fake my laughter. I have a job that pays well, you can say I'm financial independent. But none of this matters soon, being the only son I MUST keep the family's bloodline going. But well, with this mess inside my head, I don't know what to do now. I've been thinking about confessing it all to him, maybe that will actually freak him out and I can finally move on? But, damn, so many but, the idea of actually losing him from my life forever scares the shit out of me. After all I'm this loser who can have his whole week brightened just by receiving a text ""hey"" from a bro I'm secretly in love, even though I'll just pretend to ignore it or reply with K. It's that pathetic.",1
"I just couldn't stop myself from checking it all the time, from looking at my ex and his new girlfriend's profile pics. Even seeing people that I love and care about being happy made me compare my life to theirs and find myself wanting. That isn't right, I can't believe I've fallen so far I begrudge them their happiness. I need to get my head straight. It was tough. It's been over 10 years of my life recorded on that site. The good times mostly, some of the bad, and occasionally I posted something clever. But it's for the best. My life needs to be real. It needs to be where I am. And if I falter, I've still got 14 days to recover it.",4
"Hi everyone! 

So I realized my depression is better at home, when I can be with my dogs. That's partially because I have to take care of them. 

The thing is, at school, I can't really have any pets- and I'm graduating soon which means I can't have a new one right now. I won't be stable. 

So I got a cactus! I've never really taken care of a plant before so I've decided it was easy enough. I have an app and she has a name- so hopefully this works. 

What can you take care of to help? ",4
"My best friend is gone. She hasn't responded in days. I haven't been able to talk to anyone else. I feel so alone. I want to say my goodbyes to everyone at some point next week. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't tell my parents about this because they usually ask me if I have a girlfriend, as a joke/nice gesture.",5
"More than ever, my motivation is just gone. I've been 'unhappy' for roughly 3 years (I've refrained from calling myself depressed since I haven't actually been professionally diagnosed with anything since I'm too afraid to get help). I don't feel like waking up anymore. I wake up briefly, then sleep until 3 in the afternoon. I haven't been going to sleep until 4:00 AM at the earliest, because I lie there and dwell on the dumb things that I've done in the past, think about the the things I'm afraid of for my future, struggle with my crippling loneliness-- I just can't fall asleep instantly.
I don't feel like eating. I have no appetite. I'm losing weight when I'm already too thin. Because of my social anxiety, I've isolated myself from everyone I used to know-- and now I have nobody. I'm too emotionally attached to a group of people that will never even know that I exist, so much so that the thought of them being gone someday completely breaks me. My feelings have only gotten worse, especially over the last two months. I've cried so many times over the past few days. I haven't taken care of myself at all.
I don't think I'd ever bring myself to take my own life, but the thought of randomly being put out of my misery seems so refreshing.
But I'm too afraid to speak up about it to anybody. I don't want to worry anyone. And the times that I have tried to subtly cry for help, I've only been responded to with ""Go home, lie down, drink some tea, and read a book-- you might feel better!"" but it doesn't work like that.

I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I want to do something, yet I don't want to do anything at all.",4
"JUst need to ramble a little. Over 30 years of life it is not encouraging where I've gotten. Don't even feel worth trying to reach out to a friend. Afraid we weren't close enough for her to be cool with where I'm at, plus don't know how to talk that isn't just saying run away from me. Drifted from my oldest friend and know I'm cast aside there. Feel another coming. Went through the most humiliating time of my life and have zero support system. Just a complete failure. No confidence in treatment helping anymore. I just don''t even want to try anymore. tired of meds, tired of empty promises. Too afraid to do anything. Waste. Hugs are never coming. Conversations are never coming. If this doesn't work and I already completely doubt it then I'm scared of whats next. Nrear the end. back at bottom again. you arent supposed to return to bottom. no interest in hobbies anymore. failure, waste. this shit will never work because I won't let it WTF! deserve to die. Never going to get better. only make it worse. fuck you. please just end me. what happened?",2
"SO I have struggled with clinical depression my entire life, and I see a psychaitrist/therapist, and I talk with my therapist and something I struggle with the most is I can be hard on myself/expect a lot of out myself, and always feel overwhelming guilty, or like a failure, or worthless, or disgusting when I don't do something right or make a mistake. And I don't know if what happened this time is one of those cases where I am being too hard on myself or if I should feel horrible and guilty.

So I also do drink with friends usually once a week or so (at a bar, friends house, or my place), but I know how dangerous it can be to drink with depression and sometimes I have gotten too drunk so I really try to be conscious and drink responsibly when I do. And last night I had like 5 friends over for a girl's night, and we all drank and had fun drunk talk until like 5am, and it was really great and fun and I think I drank just the right amount (enough to have a good time but not enough to go overboard), but at the very end of the night I guess I had one last drink too many because the last hour of the night is fuzzy (like I kind of remember the last hour but not fully)....and I didn't do anything bad or embarassing in regards to hanging out with my friends, but when I woke up (and this is what I feel disgusting and guilty about) I discovered I wet the bed!!! And i feel horrible and disgusting that I let myself drink that much again that I fucking wet the bed? like i feed so ashamed and horrible and gross and disgusting. and im so sad becase it was a really great and fun night otherwise but i feel like this ruins the entire memory too because i just feel so ashamed and guilty and disgusting. Like even being able to type this out was hard because I feel so horrible and ashamed. And I live with my husband and I made sure to clean it up so he wouldn't find out and not even tell him because I felt so ashamed (I ended up falling asleep on the guest bed in a different room than him where me and my friends were hanging out)


and all day ive felt absolutely horrible and gross and disgusting and ashamed. and i dont know if i should ever even trust myself to drink again after i did something so horrible??? And am I just being too hard on myself, or should I feel this bad and was what I did that disgusting and horrible? And should I even trust myself to drink with friends anymore after that? ",3
"One person wished me a merry Christmas. one person wished me a happy new year. one person called to see if I was doing anything. He is literally my only friend.

I just wanted to say that if you know someone who is depressed/lonely, call them and let them know you care, it would mean a lot to them.",4

"I met Annie in 5th grade (I am in 6th grade now),In 5th grade,there was this camp where we are supposed to go to,we were supposed to make new friends and know each other better,fuck all,that shit was completely neglected throughout the whole time,The camp was where I first started to like Annie.

How we first talked was fucking stupid.on the first day (Night),we were supposed to prepare for a dance,there was this open area where we would practice,that time,I was bored af,I had no intrest in dancing,being the fuckface introvert I am,I looked around,and saw this screen-door thing,which led to what looked like complete darkness,I mumbled ""Hmm,what's in there"",Then out of nowhere,Annie said ""I don't know,you go in first and tell me""
At this point,I could take the oppurtuinity to introduce myself,try to start a conversation,or get to know her better,but instead,I said ""Nah,ladies first!"" Till this day I still question my past.By the way,Annie was awkward and witty,exactly the same shit as I was,so at that point,I started taking intrest in her.

Next semester,3 months later,Annie and I got into the same group,I wanted to know more about her,so we talked a bit,and my god,she was the girl of my dreams,Other than being witty and awkward,I then knew that she was the cutest little thing ever,and her voice,jesus it makes me jizz myself every time (Joke!).From that point on,we were really good friends,we were talking about random shit every minute of class,and had a wonderful time,her existence made a shield around me,all negative thinking,depression,existential thoughts,would be repelled from that ""Shield around me"",I was looking forward to school every night,and I constantly felt in love even though I have no idea what she thought of me.She was so awesome that even if she friendzoned me for life,I would still remain cheerful.

We had too much fun,our teacher fucking seperrated us,immediately,I went from ecstatic to suicidal,I cried myself to sleep almost every day,fantacising of us together again.

After the suicidal thoughts,I was always sad,negativity could easily penetrate me without that ""shield"",She would sometimes react to my jokes,but that's it,I never dared to speak to her since then,I hate social anxiety.

Annie,where are you?Depression has overtook me,judging from our history,only you can help me,I really miss having that ""Shield""...",5

"Hey everyone. Some context, I'm 16, sophomore, this all happened through my mid freshmen and mid sophomore year. I have pretty bad depression but got medication about maybe two months ago.

My once best friend lives over 7,000 miles away from me. She lives in South Africa while I live in the United States, specifically in central Texas. I met her on an app called ""talklife"" where you just vented about... life! I had made a post about how I hated myself, and I was in tears when one day she messaged me. She said she would be willing to be there for me and eventually our friendship really started to grow. She trusted me really quickly.

We mostly communicated on whatsapp. One day she randomly messaged me saying she hurt herself. It broke my heart. I wish I could have been there for her in person to hug her and be there for her. But I couldn't, but I did my best to comfort her. She opened up a lot on what she's been through. Bullying, parental abuse, and at one point a boy from her school pretty much threatened to rape her and nobody would take her seriously when she talked about it.

We both came to each other whenever we were hurt. I doubt she would ever admit it but she was a little clingy to me at one point, but I soon became waaay more clingy than she ever was. I was very attached to her. Being the closest friend I have ever had and the first person I would go to when I was hurting. 

I think my clingyness to her, along with my insecurity and depression, made things start to go downhill in our friendship. The first time we had a fight was when I was having an awful day at school and I was dying to vent to her. I was holding in tears at my classes and needed to talk but she was busy and constantly going offline. I felt like she was ignoring me and I told her ""fuck you"" and blocked her. It was weird, I felt better after that. I shouldn't have, because I potentially just ruined a friendship, but I felt better just being nasty, like it got my frustration and hurt out.

I unblocked her and apologized but she was hurting. However I recorded a video of myself just talking and apologizing, and admitting how I was a dick, and she really felt way happier after seeing it and seemed back in a good mood. I was glad she wasn't holding a grudge and felt better after the video I sent her.

It may sound weird to send her a video of myself, but I think net neutrality is not a thing in South Africa, so she has some bundle she says where she can use a couple apps but is unable to call at all. It took me a while to understand.

We had a lot of arguments along our friendship. A lot of times I questioned if it was getting toxic. However whenever we explained both our sides and admitted our faults, we were on good terms again. However, I still think it was taking a toll on our friendship.

There was a point where we got into an argument about something, I don't remember exactly all the details, but here's what I remember.

So we had planned to want to visit sometime. One day I watched a documentary on South Africa over it's gangs and crimes, and I jokingly told her I changed my mind over visiting. It was a dick move to joke about but I told her I didn't mean it, and that she should calm down. She started going off on me and I kind of ignored it. She later posted something on her status with her parents hugging her and it's caption said ""abuse."" I know it seems like a joke, but she has told me about how her mom hits her and has made her cry in fear, and how she's felt suicidal because of how her mom treated her, so I wasn't sure. I told her if she needed anyone I was hear and she told me ""Uhm... it was a joke."" I know that doesn't seem rude to say, but by her standards it really is. I was pretty insulted and I started kind of going off on her.

Eventually I tried to apologize but she wouldn't respond. I called her a disease and she told me she wished me a good life but couldn't take this and blocked me, ""for good."" I messaged her through my brother, messaging her school's name. She had a uniform on her Instagram she gave me where it said her school's name in big bold letters, I didn't stalk her or anything. She unblocked me and kind of panicked, but I told her how I found her school's name. I texted her it because I learned freaking her out gets her to message people back. I said let's try to fix things but she wasn't budging. I started getting mad and feeling very hurt. I felt like if she was a real friend she would try to fix things with me, and not cut me off, especially considering how close we were. When I look back on this know, I was pretty stupid for how mean I was to her, and not realizing she was just tired of all the arguing and me hurting her.

I told her some incredibly nasty things, bringing up a lot of the things she struggled with and vented to me about, only to have me use it against her and break her down. I could tell I was getting to her, really making her hurt. I was acting like a sadist over her ""being a fake friend"" which she wasn't. Simply tired of the arguments, my temper and emotional bullying. She soon blocked me later.

I wish I realised that my reaction was so stupid. In my mind I just viewed her as being a fake friend, and never meaning any of the times she was there for me since she wouldn't want to fix things with me.

The feeling of her being a fake friend really hurt me and made me kind of crazy. I cried a lot because I felt so betrayed. I borrowed my friend's phone's to text her things like ""you should kill yourself"" and ""you just lost the only friend you had."" Just really nasty things. At one point, I made an entire account on Instagram dedicated to making fun of her. I posted dumb edits of her face and made posts going into detail why I thought she was a piece of shit. I followed a ton of her peers and got up to like 700 followers at one point. I informed her about it and she started freaking out.

A couple weeks pass. One day, a friend of her's, who was also mine too, saw one of my posts and sent it to her to maybe make her realise some of the scummy things she has been doing. I made them sound a lot worse than they really were yet not quite making it a lie. She said she wasn't going to read it and was starting to get over what I had done. My friend reminded her of the times I was there for her, and how if I was hurting I obviously meant a lot to her, and him saying that made her unblock me and forgive me. I was very skeptical but we talked things out and I deleted the account even though I still felt like she was being fake to me.

I needed to get somethings off my chest and in a voice note I told her how she had hurt me before the account was made, and I was still having trouble if I wanted to be her friend or not. She then told me that she was sorry for the hurt she caused, but then she told me the hurt she felt from what I did.

She said every day she walked into school terrified that someone would bring up the account. She would hurt herself and contemplated suicide constantly while the account was up and while I sent her those disgusting messages. She tried to force herself to be strong but all it did was push her suicidal urges down for a short time. She cried while saying all this and said she was scared to be my friend again, because she didn't want me to hurt her like that again.

It hurt so much. I started crying and really felt like shit. I explained more of the hurt I felt but also gave a deeper apology and explained more on things that had contributed to me being an asshole. She then recorded a very long voice note, I think about 9 minutes, talking about how she was sorry for making me cry and the hurt she caused before, and how she forgave me, and how she was my glad to be my friend again.

That feeling I had when we fixed all that shit was truly amazing. I felt so much better. But I also felt a lot of guilt for what I had done to her, but I was glad we were friends again. I tried to be kinder and more patient and understanding with her. But honestly it didn't work. We had another big argument shortly.

She told me she was planning on trashing her phone. I was really hurt. It was the only way I had to contact her, as she couldn't mail me since her mom couldn't stand online friends. I told her I was feeling like shit because of her doing this, but she said it was because she truly believed she would be happier without her phone, and she wasn't doing it to trash me. That's not how I felt and when I got those messages I had to lock myself in the bathroom and cry. I felt so unimportant to her.

We argued about it for a while but I kept trying to keep in my frustration and hurt. Then randomly one day I snapped. All those feelings of her being a fake friend came back. I told her I was so fucking done with her and if she ever messaged me again I would reactivate the account, and that she should go die in a hole.

A couple days later I apologized but asked her to still not contact me, and eventually after about two weeks I asked to talk to her. She said all the suicidal feelings came back and she went back to her habit of harming herself and crying to sleep. She kept saying things like ""go ahead, tell me I should die"" when I was apologizing and she eventually threatened to kill herself. I contacted her mom through one of her friends and told her to make sure she was okay. I know she was abusive but I know she wouldn't let her kill herself. She was okay, but she also told her all the things I did to her, which resulted in her mom telling me to kill myself and threatened me with a court case and tracking me down if she had to. Honestly wasn't worried about her threats at all, and even if I did get in trouble, well I deserved it.

So yeah, I am sorry this was so damn long. I just wanted this entire situation off my chest. I feel so guilty for how I hurt her and constantly cry at night because of it, and I miss her so much. I wish I wasn't such an asshole. I have never treated anybody so poorly in my life yet she's the closest friend I have ever had. I'm usually extra nice to girls and I was always there for her when she was hurting or needed anyone but sometimes my emotions would go crazy and my mind would get truly fucked up. A lot of it has to do with us being only online friends. I really don't treat any of my friends in real life like that.

I really wish she would listen to me apologize and kind of explain why I was hurt, and allow me to make it up to her by maybe like mailing her a gift. I miss her. I genuinely hope she's okay. I don't want to believe I'm an awful person because I do care about her, and so many other people in my life, but sometimes I'm just a terrible person with the way I explode. I don't know if I should forgive myself, I feel like I deserve to hate myself and have everyone around me hate me.

*TL;DR I emotionally tormented my best friend because I was so insecure and vengeful for times she really hurt me, even though it usually wasn't her fault, and it resulted in so much harm towards her. I feel like I deserve so much worse because of what I did.*

I'm sorry if this doesn't seem like the best sunreddit to post this, but it does deal with two people who suffer from it and causes a lot of pain in their life even though the mail focus has been on the relationship. This sunreddit also seems the most supportive from others I have tried.

Anyways, happy New Year's everyone. I hope you guys enjoy it ð",4
" That's the one thing I can't start. I'm not overweight or anything, I just want to feel better, since apparently it helps, but I can't seem to start. I can start meditation, walking, a new hobby but even with gym equipment downstairs, I can't make myself start. I think I'm afraid of something.",0
Just been feeling depressed and lonely. Wanted someone to talk with.,4
"Nights of battling away constant suicidal thoughts, feelings of loneliness, hopelessness.  It's exhausting, but I stay awake dealing with it.  It's getting so overwhelming.  14 years of depression, and I still can't control or get used to this.  I feel so alone.  The fast way out is so appealing.",5
"I'm making this post just to vent mainly. Here's some stuff about me:

I am a mid 20s male. I make good money, enough to save half of it and probably retire early. I have a great girlfriend that is an absolute blessing in my life. I'm decently in shape and used to be a bodybuilder but that kind of slipped away. I'm a smart person, always in the top 15% of whatever academic class. Great parents that support me. It all started going downhill when I went to grad school but realized it was a dead end and started getting depressed. Later I learned that most people get depressed in grad school because it's such a shitty prospect. It has been 1.5 years since I decided to dropout from a PhD and I'm still fucking livid about how shitty it was. Like I can't move my life past it. Now my job is mostly boring and easy but pays way better.

Now here I am 2 years later and still depressed. It's just like I am watching my life fall apart in front of my very eyes unable to do anything about it. But that's the thing, I have it so good that I can't even let my life fall apart. One person told me I couldn't fail if I tried and it's like I'm trying to prove him wrong. It's like I'm trying to fail but I just can't. And I think that contributes to the helpless feeling. At the heart of my depression is just the hopelessness and lack of control that kills me. I want to feel like I'm in some sort of control over my life but it feels like no matter what I do, hard work, lazy, focus on this or that, it just feels like it doesn't matter either way. That takes all of the fun out of life for me. It feels like life turned from a choose-your-own-adventure to a roller coaster ride with a fixed track. No way to get off the ride, just have to take the shit that comes along. I'm slowly giving up all the passions I used to have because I'm either not good enough or I'm worse at stuff than I used to be. I long to be like the 21 year old version of myself. I was so happy then.

But I'm so confused because right now I live with a guy who is fat, eats unhealthy, doesn't have many friends, is annoying, no college degree, never moved out of this area. Just generally a nerd with little social skills. But he seems to be happy. And I'm so confused. How can I have so much more going for me but be miserable? I just want this to end. I want to just be satisfied and happy with my life but I can't find anything that will scratch that itch. I'm just existing and the only thing I'm looking forward to is getting a dog, retiring early, and getting married. Those are pretty cool things, but it just feels like brain is so fucked that I won't be able to enjoy it. I smoke weed (not all the time) to cope and it helps, but really just delays these feelings like I'm having now. Fuck.",2
"I want to commit suicide but I can't.  I have tried so many times nothing has worked.  Also, i dont want people to think my parents are bad people if i am successful",5
"So I got a new therapist and she's good but I've only seen her 3 times, and I haven't seen her for a few weeks now. I'm a minor so I'm afraid she's going to fear for my safety and tell my parents, because I never want to 100% say I'm not gonna harm myself because I'm not a liar and I can never be sure.. if that makes sense. So dont know what to do, especially sense I don't really want to continue therapy, so it'll probably be our last session anyways. I just don't know what to do:(",5
"I just turned 20 in mid December, I don't have a job, I don't go to school and my girlfriend (of two years) that told me she wanted to be together forever and even shared a dog with me has been ignoring me since Thanksgiving. I caught her getting almost daily voicemails left on her phone by a guy I was clear I wasn't okay with the flirting with. Today I got a text out of the blue saying She wants to meet in person this week to âmove onâ. Every part of me still wants to be with her and it kills me to think of a life without her; especially after going as far as planning our futures together. I thought the holidays were going to be the worst of it, but I'm slowly realizing that when everyone is getting back into their routines I'm still stuck. I want to get a job and go to school and be successful, but I feel trapped in this dark pit. I really don't want to live anymore and the only thing keeping me from killing my self is the pain and disarray I would cause my Mom and Dad. I see a psychiatrist and take antidepressants daily; I have since I was 13. I don't want to open myself up completely to my therapist because of my fears of being shipped to a mental health hospital. My parents in the past have seriously suggested that I stay in one. I don't know it's hard to believe you can live a normal life or be normal after you've been locked in a psych ward.",4
"I've (24m) been suffering from depression for about the past three years and nobody but a couple of health care professionals know this about me. Maintaining my image is rough. I'm in excellent physical shape, on track to a âsuccessfulâ future, seemingly happy, and I get along with everybody. People have no idea that working hard in the gym, school and work is just the way I cope. I throw myself into any type of work I find to keep myself so busy I can't think about how unhappy I am. I don't really have any close friends, I hate my family, I haven't been intimate with a girl in 6 years, and i just feel like a complete outsider everywhere I go. I fantasize about awesome ways I could die (eg die trying to save a baby in a burning house) so people don't think of me as another victim to depression. I guess I just really hate feeling people's sympathy. I refuse to be seen as a victim and it's what keeps me going despite the complete lack of joy I have in life. ",4
"""It gets better."" Yeah. Then it gets worse again. Every time something good happens to me something 10 times worse comes to shut it all down. Maybe I'm just meant to die alone. Maybe I'm just meant to be this sad. If god is real, he hates me...but it's okay, because I hate me too. Happy new year.",5
"I have a lot of friends that have done a lot of cool stuff. Like travelling, living abroad, for example. I grew up in a poor family and I've never got to travel much. I've never even left the country. I feel like my friends are more spoiled and had the chance to do all of these cool things at a young age. Even if they weren't spoiled, I feel like they are luckier than me in some way. I just feel bad for not have had those kinds of experiences yet in my life. I'm 23.

I'm going to travel one day. It's just that as of right now, I'm sick of hearing all of their stories. I feel bad for not wanting to hear it, especially when it was such an important part of their life.",4
"I haven't gone to see a shrink yet but I feel like I need to. Everyday I feel miserable about my family being poor. We're not even THAT poor. But it's more like I wish we were rich. Being poor sucks. I feel ashamed everyday because of our poverty. It really sucks when you're surrounded by rich people. We have rich relatives. I have rich friends. I have rich classmates because I'm in law school and I can't help but compare my life to theirs. They have cars and always have nice and new clothes. 

It doesn't help that I live in a place where there's serious income inequality and people are status-conscious. It really eats me up and I wish I was born into a life of privilege.

I can't even enjoy anything anymore because I'm always thinking about money every single minute. ",2
"I have been taking Mirtazapine 15mg for a month and the last 3 days I've been taking Mirtazapine 7.5mg to start to wean myself off them. Like 30 minutes ago, I had what I believe to be a seizure. I was taking a bath. When I got up to get out I felt dizzy, light-headed, and my vision started blacking out. I sat down on the toilet because I felt faint, and then all I can remember is waking up on the ground inbetween the toilet and my sink, twitching. I am wondering if this could have anything to do with me taking Mirtazapine? I know the obvious answer is go talk to your GP, but I can't get in until Thursday and I'm worried so I would like to figure out possible causes before I go. Thanks any help is appreciated.

Also I don't know if this is the right subreddit to ask, but I figured it would be worth a shot.",3
"Throwaway because my other account is related to my occupation. TLDR: sick of the grind of depression, no support system, just need to get it out.

Basically, I have no will to live. I don't want to kill myself, but I wouldn't mind ceasing to exist. I've been like this one other time in my life-when I was 15 and hospitalized for 4 weeks. During that time, however, I did want to die. I feel like I want to crawl out of my skin from anxiety but at the same time,  I have zero energy or motivation to get out of bed. Recently I've had some serious financial problems, but nothing else has changed. I have an amazing job that people dream of and thousands of people would take in a second.I live in a beautiful area of the country, and I have food to eat and a roof over my head. I have a couple friends and a boyfriend and two cats. I'm so depressed at this point that the none of this seems to matter. I just want to sleep as much as possible. 

I've been on and off antidepressants since I was 9 years old (28 now) and it's been 3 solid years with none. I felt good for a long time and one of the worst parts of this is knowing that at any time, for the rest of my life this can and will return. For no reason. And I worked so hard to wean off medications and it's very discouraging to know it's time again. 

I have a doctors apt at the end of January to ask to be put back on meds. Definitely not looking forward to the usual 6 week haze that follows. I'm also in the medical field, and sadly there is a pretty big stigma associated with mental health. It's not respected and no one talks about it. Patients with it are taken less seriously.  I feel very alone. I'm  estranged from my family for many years and moved across the country 3 years ago and have a very small circle (like 3 people.)

I guess I just needed to get it out. And continue to analyze how I'm going to make it and function for the next 4 weeks (and then 6 weeks for full effect of meds) and I'm just sick and literally tired of the beast called depression. I know it can get better, I'm just tired of waiting.

Though I only slept 2 hours and a half, I managed to wet his sleeping bag, his sofa, and both my pants and my dress.

"In 2016 these events took place for me: husband left me for one of my best friends, cancer scare, hysterectomy to prevent cancer, betrayed by friends who knew about the affair, soon to be ex has my 3 and 5y/o half the time now, raped. Just a week or 2 ago I started feeling very aggravated with people who were struggling with life. I'd compare their problems to mine and think ""everyone is so weak Try living my life"" Now, my whole life I've been the most sensitive person I've ever met. I always felt proud of my unconditional, tireless compassion. But, my whole life I've always gotten my feelings hurt so easily and I spent wayyy to much time people pleasing and trying to get everyone to like me. As I said, lately I feel nothing for the less fortunate. If I notice say, someone being nasty at work to me, I observe it but give it zero other thoughts. I've been dating and I have no intentions for anything but sex. I have no close or bonding feelings with these men. So I actually like this feeling of self-reliance. To not be such a people pleaser has made my life a lot easier. What gets me nervous is my impulsiveness. I keep doing things to see if I'll get caught, or hurt or arrested. Like, I'm a waitress and a customer was slightly snappy with me. No big deal. I decided to spit in his drink so if he continued to be rude I could have a good laugh about it. 2 men I've slept with have girlfriends and to this day we still text/hookup and I could care less for the girl whose relationship I'm invading. I don't even try to rationalize this behavior. I just have no concern whatsoever about how others feel. I drive very fast, all the time. Recklessly and aggressively too. If I think I can definitely get away with it I'll steal and feel nothing, no guilt. If you read this and can't get past the ""sleeeping with taken men"" or are horrified I'd spit in food, I already know it's despicable, I just don't care. If you wanna reply with some useful insight or personal experience with this please go right ahead. If you wanna just bash my shitty actions go right ahead too. I'm just seriously wondering if anyone's ever become temporarily sociopathic and will my concern for others come back? I don't want them too. It's very fun doing whatever I want.

"My daughter tried to kill herself, again. This is the third attempt that I know of. Her husband walked into the bathroom as she was digging into her arm. He said he has never seen anything like it. He is traumatized. After discovering that she had been self medicating with drugs and then this he is done. He is scared that her poor choices will land him in military prison. I love my daughter and this young man and I am saddened for both of them. I am sad for my daughter, I am not sure she will survive this break up. I am truly afraid that I will be burying my daughter.

My daughter has a mental illness. She has been diagnosed as bipolar and clinically depressed. This has been a struggle since she was a young teenager. We have lost friendships and family ties because of her poor choices, the lies, and lack of impulse control. She has stolen medication from me and others. She revealed, in a most spectacular fashion, that she was a drug addict when she was a teenager, all in front of a class that we were taking together. Needless to say I gave myself permission to have distance from my daughter. She was an adult. I had gotten her help, I had fought with her about staying on medications and going to doctors appointments. As an adult I could no longer force her to do what needed to be done, it was now up to her. 

She seemed to figure it out. She had a job, a bf, a home, and friends. I could see that she struggled with the rollercoaster that came with her diagnosis, but she was making it. Couple years in things toppled. Suddenly her friends and bf were done with, she had burned bridges with them. She was floating with no anchor or refuge. Except me and my partner. We were moving and offered her the opportunity to start fresh in another state. She leaped at the opportunity. But she first wanted to visit with my sister in yet another state. The agreement was that she would join us in the new place after spending time with my sister.

This turned into her living there until she burned bridges there. She became homeless. Too prideful to tell me that she was reduced to living in a homeless camp. All because she was now taking drugs to self medicate and she knew this would horrify me. She kept a job. She met the young man who would help get her clean, and marry her. He joined the military, they got stationed state side. Her husband and I continually prompted her to get medication and help. She put it off. She was on a high with life. Then the cycle began again.

She started using meth about 6 months ago. She snorted cocaine. She smoked weed. She planted this stuff in another persons car so that they couldn't turn her in. She was making illogical choices based on the drugs and her ill mind. My SIL left her to figure out what to do. Her actions could land him in Leavenworth, ruin his career. 

He came home and found what she had done. He got help for her. She calls me to tell me in her most piteous voice. Tries to tell me that he wouldn't listen to her, that she was getting rid of his monster of a wife. No amount of explaining and questioning would get her to see that these were her choices. As I write this, she is hospitalized. She knows that he wants a divorce, but she wants to fight for him. No convincing her that this is what needs to happen right now. He doesn't trust her, he is angry, and tired. I don't think he wants to continue and I can not blame him.

So where does this leave my broken daughter? I don't know. I am in another state. I am not where she wants to be. I fear that once she is released and she sees that he is done and he removes her from base it will be the beginning of the end. I have told her she needs to figure out what she wants. I feel she will choose drugs and all that comes with it. While I want so much more for her, I can't make her choose the path of health and sanity. I am heartbroken.",4
"I'm sitting here just reading all your guy's and girl's posts feeling like all you are. Let me just share whats going on in my life for a moment...

I'm 25 living with one of my grandparents taking care of her because she's old and can't get around. I love her to death and would do anything for her, but I would never tell her any of this because I feel like I need to shoulder everything. She is battling her own grief due to the loss of her closest sister and sister-in law. It was two weeks ago when one of my aunts past away (grandmas sister-in-law) and four months who I was closest (and my grandmas sister) with, who was my whole world. The hole in my heart just keeps getting bigger and I don't know how to stop it. She use to be my compass and now I feel completely lost without her. I also took care of her for about the last eight months of her life and felt like it just went by so quickly. I traveled with her when I was younger and had so many memories... now knowing shes gone I can't help but cry whenever something that reminds me of her pops up in my head.

I also got out of a six year relationship about two years ago which was horrible and I have a lot of scars (emotional) that I still haven't shaken off. I've been battling with loneliness and depression for a long time now. We would constantly fight towards the end of our relationship, but there was a time she showed me what it was like to have a real connection with someone. I pursued one or two other women after the one, but they never were looking for anything serious. I have friends who complain about their girlfriends/boyfriends and I just sit their sometimes thinking to myself...at least you have someone. I would give anything I feel to have a connection with anyone now a days, I feel like when it comes to being by myself I go into a dark corner in to my mind I can never escape. Almost feels like I'm sinking into a giant ocean and I can see the light slowly fading away and this huge amount of pressure keeps crushing me. 

I have a few friends and a lot of family members, and their company is like a drug that I try to cling on to. Two of my friends are kind of close, but they have their own lives and we don't see each other often. Most of my other friends are gone in other schools far away. My family also is kind of disconnected. When we get together it can be amazing, but their something inside myself that clicks and I hide my depression with them. They always can have a blast with each other but I feel so disassociated with them I don't feel like I belong. When it comes to parting ways I know what comes next when I'm by myself. I've told one of my relatives once, but they couldn't understand what I was going through. I've told my mom also, but she just doesn't quite know exactly what I'm feeling. She tries, but it just hurts me knowing I'm misunderstood. My friends wouldn't understand so I never tell them. 

I try to keep myself busy by going to school, reading, video games, leaving but the escape is only brief. I can't find a permanent cure for what I'm feeling. I just find myself laying in bed most of the time....trying to battle myself and never winning. Its been a few years...and I'm still depressed. I know this may not be intense as some of your guys's battles but thanks for reading if you got down this far.",4
"And that'll never change.I could struggle to death to change something or not do anything at all, and things would be exactly the same.As you can tell, I have nothing, I am nothing.At this point, I'd be a fool if I thought there's any hope left for a loser like me.My teenage years felt like they weren't there in the first place.Never been to a party, a date, never got a driver's licence while everyone was posting pictures and congratulating each other after managing to do so on the first try(because I failed the test 4 times as I'm a stupid loser, not because of money), spent every single day on the computer as there's literally NOTHING else I could(and can) do and lastly never achieved anything meaningful while I was in school.After all, I guess this screen I've been staring at since forever is the only thing that keeps me going.But I guess this type of loser(that is me of course) needs to exist so that others can feel even better about themselves.

"I guess that's just about it. I'm in the deepest depression I've ever been in my long-ish life. Been through a devastating medical issues, three close friends died recently, lost my job and my health care and the fucking holidays are shit. Mostly my friends leave me alone, but a few have actually gotten angry at me for not paying attention to them. They say, ""Let me know if there's anything I can do to help."" and when I say, ""Buy my meds,"" they say no. ""Help me clean my house."" they say they can't. Etc. When they keep blathering this shallow bullshit at me, demanding my attention and then get mad when I remind them that I already told them how to help and they said no. I just step away. But I feel like I should have something to say to them that sets them straight. Wondering if anyone else has dealt with anything like this. Thanks.",4
"Hello, this is a stream of consciousness type rant. I seem to have relapsed back into the previous rant shitposting that I'm more than sure that some people might recognize.

The other day, I was literally called ugly by my own mother. I can't escape reality now.

This is what i look like.

When you see my face from the side, my chin literally goes back into my face. I'm so fucking horrendous.

I can't stand it. I am so angered at, nobody in particular... but only myself, I guess?

I hate being Indian. I don't hate Indians. I love our history, our culture, our languages, our people... but I hate BEING Indian. I hate having to explain to annoying ""progressives"" that think that India is an extremely misogynistic country or the like.

Even if it is, I don't see what I have to do with it? Why can't I be associated with the thousands of Indian men that marched for the rapists to receive justice? Nope. Guess I can march for my country's women, get hosed by the police, but I'm still an evil Indian rapist. Great.

Now that's not something I've gotten more than twice IRL, and dozens of times online but I hardly care about the latter, but I still wanted to mention it.

Indians are seen by everyone, even Indians themselves, as undesirable. It's a pain.

Now the weird thing is that I don't even know if I have a sexuality. I sometimes imagine myself as asexual.

This is because:

1. I find breasts and women in general to be attractive

2. I am repulsed to sex and vagina (receiving oral sex or a handjob is the only thing I'm not repulsed by)

I wouldn't classify myself to be asexual, but possibly I might be?

--------

--------

It's not even with dating or girls, I don't have romantic feelings to people or anything. I'm sick and tired of having been born flawed and ugly like this, and feeling ugly.

I don't know why I even dislike being ugly, because it's not like I care about it possibly impacting my relationships or friendships or anything like that.

For a while, I seemed to forget about my physical appearance.

Is physical appearance just the elephant in the room?

Whenever people talk about physical appearance like this, and call themselves ugly, the number one point of advice they receive is ""you're not even ugly.""

What about the fact that, according to people I've asked IRL and the internet /r/amiugly and /b/ and even this subreddit, I am ugly?

What do I do then?

""Ugly"" is literally an insult for things. I'm supposed to deal with the fact that my presentation is a literal insult?

I'm fuming.

"I am almost 18 and I don't go out, ever, except when I have to go to school. Currently it's the winter break and all times I went out was when I had to take the trash. I have no real friends, only one that I met on a game 4 years ago. Ever since I was a child everyone told me that I'm so shy, I've been working on this problem and I think I improved. The eye contact is so important. I'm feeling so worthless and I don't know where life will lead me to. I'm also so sad because in 3 hours it's the NYE and everyone is supposed to have a good time partying and I'm staying here feeling insecure and lonely. I have severe acne and never had a girlfriend or even a kiss. When I'm talking to girls that I find attractive I stutter so bad and don't make eye contact but with the rest of people I think I'm improving. Also... serious overthinking. Things that happened 2 years ago and I still can't get them out of my mind. There are a lot of things that I don't like about myself that I can't remember now. I hope this year it will be better, i really do..

I wrote this tonight and I wonder how my husband or family would feel if they found it and it was too late. I wonder if they would wish they had cut me some slack, listened to me, or if they would just feel relieved that I'm gone. I wonder if they would realize that I wasn't a piece of sh*t, I was genuinely dying and it controlled my life. I feel like nobody is responding to or considering my cries for help. I'm alone. I'm just alone.

Some days I just want to die;

There'd be no more days of standing by

Wondering why life is full of darkness.

Some days I just want to die,

This pain I can't hardly take...

And I'd rather plunge a stake through my heart

Than keep watching my world fall apart

Piece by crumbled piece.

The world is not my friend or yours,

It feels like nobody truly loves you

Until your lips turn blue and your skin is a lighter hue, your body burned or buried.

And how many more traumas can I carry on my shoulders

Before I stone myself to death with imaginary boulders

Because I feel like a soldier who has no more fight,

No will to live,

No pill to swallow to stop the impending hollow feeling inside?

How many more times can I die

Figuratively, but emotionally, too,

Before I can't handle any more abuse?

How many different ways can I say ""I'm dying"" before someone realizes I am not smiling?

Where can I go when people show their true intentions and I need a place to heal?

Can I come to you?

Together can we steal back our happiness?

Can we give each other something real, something normal, something lovely?

If the answer is no,

I hope you'll simply smother me

And put to rest my aches and pains.

Drain my body drop by drop

Please don't stop or call the cops...

Just do me a favor,

Erase the stains I leave behind

And find a way to smile and shine when I'm gone.

I love you unconditionally

I want to give you the best of me

Show you you're my soul

But I feel a gaping hole in my heart

A wound that stretches further apart every time I open my eyes

The size forever growing

Please, please, please

Please hear my cries

Please give me a chance to speak.

Don't mistake me for weak,

Just know I've fought for so long

And I'm trying so hard to be strong

But some days I just want to die.",5

Like it beat the shit out of me. I put an end to something fucked up that I did but the damage is still there and not completely cleared because I don't know how to approach the situation because I'm fucking mentally fucked up and I don't even know how to explain that to someone. I spent days in bed, crying, paranoid walking around outside thinking people know all my secrets and all thats wrong with me. I've spent days being yelled at by my parent, being a second parent to my little sibling and still being told that I do nothing. That I don't give. Being emotionally and verbally abused by my sister. Letting guilt numb me till I can't feel anymore. Hating myself on top of hating myself, to the point where I want to rip myself apart whenever I see my reflection. 21 years and I have no fucking friends. I feel like the biggest piece of shit. I don't know who I am, all I know is that I'm depressed and have issues of identity, gender, personality, and traumatic experiences that fucking haunt me. Every time I told myself to go seek help I failed. Every time I tried to have a good day I came back to my room and cried till nothing came out anymore. It was a fucking shitty year. I don't see anything changing in the new year. Don't even know if I'll make it through. Tough shit. I pray every day that I die because I don't have the courage to do it myself. ",1
"Hello! I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a while now but more so anxiety. Depression was very random and I could usually find the trigger. 

However, for the past month I have felt HORRIBLE. I feel so disassociated with everyone and everything. Usually if I have a few drinks, I can easily socialize and have fun. But now, no matter what, I don't care what people are saying, not do I care to even engage in conversation. Even with close friends!

When I try to act ""normal"" it seems forced and I often go ""blank."" I feel like I have to force myself to laugh or seem happy in situations that would usually bring me joy. 

I feel like I almost induce it myself. Ever since this started about a month ago, I'm so scared I'm going to feel bad, that I start feeling bad. My brain always wins. If I let one negative thought creep in, my entire mood changes and I can't seem to change it back to positive like I used to be able to do. 

What is this feeling? Have you been able to overcome it? I used to have fun and be the life of the party. Now I can't even force it... it seems so unnatural.

I actually can drive and willing to but, the freaking state jerks me around. Because oh... You went to a mental hospital for two weeks from being suicidal when you were 16! That was almost 4 years ago and, it brings me down. They tell me that I need to be medically evaluated but, I can't get a drive to get medically evaluated when everything is 30-40 miles away.

"Like right now, I just got up. I need to feed my pets, clean the litter box, brush my teeth, start some laundry, and eat something. It feels like too much. I'm so anxious right now, and I just want to go back to bed and shut down. I don't care about today. I don't want it. 

But if I get it all done, I'll probably feel okay. That's not the case every day, but today I feel like I could get to a good place if I try. 

But then what? Tomorrow starts the same way. Too much to do. Everything's too hard and I feel sh!tty. Until I get some things done and the weight is lifted. 

Heck, even two hours from now I'll be in the same boat. There's always stuff to do. I need to clean the house, make some phone calls, shovel snow, get dressed, eat again. It never stops. 

And sometimes I can feel good when I've gotten somewhat on top of things, but what's the point? It's like an endless wild goose chase. Shouldn't I be able to just feel good, regardless of the conditions around me or what's on my to-do list? 

Also, this is just basic stuff. I don't have any kids, relationships to manage, projects or hobbies, and only about 20 hours of work a week. I'm just trying to keep myself and my animals from starving or dying from poverty, filth, or negligence. And it's so hard.

"Dear r/depression, I made a throwaway account. 

I (23yo female) have been together with my girlfriend (19yo) for almost 1.5 year now. We are very in love and very happy. She made me feel like I could finally breathe again. I moved to another city to live close to my university and she started to move in with me, because her work is very close to where I live now. I left my friends behind in the other city that is like 2 hrs away. 

My girlfriend has to do an internship in another country to finish her study. She will be gone for 6 months. She left 1 month ago and I knew it was going to be hard for me because we have been together almost every day for a long time. I feel lonely and sad because I am afraid that she might leave me. We are not that much in contact since she left. She said tons of stuff like 'I miss you, I love you' but this has stopped. She now ignores me on Whatsapp and she doesn't have time to call or facetime. She goes out at night like 2-3 times a week and she did not do this when she was home. I am too scared to confront her and ask her about this because I have always felt really insecure and she told me a couple of days ago that she is sick of me being insecure.. Which makes me even more insecure. Right now I have 2 weeks break from school to prepare myself for upcoming exams and one very very important resit. But I feel so sad and lonely and I feel nauseous all the time. I can't sleep at night and stopped eating. I am stressed about my relationship and I am stressed about my resits and it gives me panic attacks. I just feel like I have to tell someone about my story, this is why I put it here. ",4

"So I have depression, but generally I consider it more or less... I don't know... in remission?

Eventually I weaned off the meds (and therapy) and I felt pretty good.  I graduated college, got a new job, I moved to a much better area, and I'm in a stable, loving relationship.  In the past couple days, I'm starting to feel the ""depression monster"" creep back up.  I'm hoping it's just post-holiday blues.  I guess my basic question is, that's a thing, right?

A brief run down of my life:

I'm a graduate student. I've sunk 80k into my current career path, for a total of 120k in loans. I have one semester left to complete and I should be looking forward to it but I'm dreading it instead. I've lost my passion for my field and I know I'm drowning in debt. I'll make around 45k a year when I graduate so I'll be in debt until I'm 52. I feel like I have thrown my life away. I worked really, really hard for 8 years in college and it wasn't worth it.

I am 25lbs over weight, the most I've ever weighed in my life. I hate my body and myself for letting my body get this way. 

I have several chronic medical conditions including fibromyalgia. Life is literally pain for me. Physical pain.

Nothing I do makes me feel anything but sadness. I'll be doing my absolute favorite things and be fighting back tears the whole time.

All I can think about it how I'm going to have to struggle the rest of my life and it'll never get better. I won't make enough money to even take vacation or live in a nice place. I'll have to work really hard, more than healthy people, to just keep my job so I can just pay my debts and never have anything nice or any rest. And I'll be in pain the entire time until I can finally just die after a long, disgustingly hard life of struggle. The End.",2
"My mother has been depressed most of her life from what I can tell.  She and my father are separated.  He's struggling with his own battle.
I'm 24 in college and I live about an hour away.  I come home nearly every holiday, because when I was living at home during community college she became very dependent on me(to do household chores, and support her emotionally). 

She's lost her white collar job about a year ago.  She make some bad choices, transferred to a position that wasn't right for her, and got let go.  Now she's working at a warehouse job that too physical for her(out of shape).  I'm worried that her depression is getting worse and worse.  I can't quit college to move back and take care of her.  Nor, do I think that is the way to really help her.  

Every time I come home her house becomes dirtier and dirtier.  She's missing bills, becoming more reclusive, and I'm worried she depleting her savings/retirement.  She isn't taking care of herself and not really trying to fix any of this.  She's becoming more disillusioned with her job search for another white collar job.

She is going to therapy and taking medication, but I don't really see any improvement (actually the opposite).   I don't know what to do.  I really want to help her but I don't know how without enabling her dependence on me.  ",4

"Hi guys. Not sure where to start.

I hate school. I am a Junior and I am a straight A student who takes harder classes. You might think that would make me tolerate school, but I absolutely abhor it. I take no pleasure in my success, I have a bad anxiety disorder which will often debilitate me. I recently transferred for reasons I will talk about later. Because I'm new, I have no close relationships with anyone, and it's honestly understandable considering the people in my classes either feel extremely douchey or disinterested. I was never good at making friends IRL anyways I guess, I always tried to keep my social life online. I hate my teachers too, they'll often make me feel like they're under-qualified and that I am not getting the material I will need for the exam. I wish I could drop-out, I really really do, but I have no justification if I'm doing well. I'm almost off Holiday break and I have never been more anxious in my life.

My parents literally do not know the pain and discourse they are putting me through. They recently bought their dream property and they've made me move into the the place and go to school there. My life was put on hold and rapidly changed instantly. The place is in the country and is so isolated; half the time I am there, I am alone. When you're anxious about school and are completely isolated, it is the worst feeling ever, and some days I feel like I am going to die there, unhappy. They thought I would like it as much as them, but I do not. I hate it so much, I just want to be somewhere with good internet, TV, and proximity to civilization. Unfortunately, even when I express my pain, it mostly goes unheard.

I have friends online, and we're all mostly like minded people. For a time, it was great because it was the only place where I felt actually welcomed. We play games together, but I cannot anymore because my parent's new place has satellite internet with data limits. Because of this, I have grown so distant from them. Whenever I can chat, I feel like a waste of space. Only one person has truly expressed interest in what I have to offer socially, but the rest seem distant. I had plans to meet these people, but now, I feel like it is a waste of time. This means my social life is in crisis mode, along with my sanity in my own home and with my patience with school.

I wish I could stop everything and relax. I know life doesn't work that way, but if it doesn't get better, I feel like I will burn out and go crazy. I wish I could stop. I'm probably going to regret making this post in the morning but whatever, I just need someone to acknowledge my pain and maybe give advice. I do go see a counselor but I can never open up.

Nearly walked off the job as well, instead I talked to my work crew and got off early.  Why did I quit? Well they weren't paying me correctly for my job and hours and pay rates for 4 months straight. I had run out of patience. 

My dad is so sick he is currently living in the hospital. I mean we emptied his place and gave notice. And I take care of him.

I live with suicidal thoughts at any given moment of the day. I can be laughing with someone then as soon as the smile fades I'm back to thinking about killing myself.

I keep thinking about the accident I was involved in too. My truck is messed up on the left side and looks like the other persons insurance isn't going to pay the damage. I just can't believe my luck. My first accident and than my first surgery (unrelated to each other) occurred in the same week. So. I was like ok, well I was than reminded that I don't have many friends and my family is distant. I was just so involved with work and I don't really have anyone. Well I was talking to the surgeon and she said it best about all that was happening ""I am sorry, just bad luck"" And I kept thinking about that all week and its so true. Bad luck. I am know this sounds silly. I figure someone out there has problems and feelings far more severe than what I am writing. Anyways I thought of just writing my thoughts and feelings and seeing if anyone else can relate :)  ",0
"My life is so monotonous...
I wake up, go to school, come home and play video games, sleep and repeat. 

The only enjoyment I've had my winter break or the past few years is when I get high with hydrocodone or other pills. Haven't left my house to do anything in years. (Besides school which is hell as well.) No one ever texts me or care s so I dont see the point in living anymore! I'm tired of being alone, unhappy and worthless. The best part is I'm currently out of pills which is the only thing that is making me feel somewhat good. I guess a gun will have to do 

""Suicide all in my head, Why the world don't care about no one else's life till they already dead""",3
"I seriously think not. I feel like people only talk to be if they either don't want me to kill myself or they want something from me. 

For instance I recently got a boyfriend, and he's totally different than who he used to be. We used to be friends for a long time but lately all he wants to talk about it either sex, or the whole ""hey don't cut yourself, there's people who care, kisses!"". Everytime he talks about us hanging out it's about sex, or doing something sexual, and then when we do hang out that's also all he wants to do, and I just feel like he doesn't want to be in a relationship or he even actually likes me, he just wants sex and I'm easy. The rest the time it's like our conversations are some copy pasta crap about how you shouldn't cut or kill yourself. Like it used to be different we used to have actual conversations and now it seems unless there's another person there our real conversations are far and few between. 

Then there's my 'friends' who play games with me online. I'm pretty sure that's the only reason we even talk. I suck ass at fps so half the time I just make the game worse and honestly I can not fathom a single reason why they want be around, even my commentary is just me being annyoing as fuck while I let every one down. I think they just don't want to play alone, because that seems like the only reason I ever get invited to play and honestly I don't blame any of them. Or because they don't want me to kill myself, because the two that invite me to play the most are the two that know.

I seriously just want to kill myself, I honestly think it will be better for everyone, people wouldn't have to pretend to like me, they wouldn't have to suffer through be annoying them, it would be great for me too since I just hate myself so much because I'm such a fucking shit head. But I won't, because I'm a fucking pussy and I won't do it until I get the courage to do it again, and this time I won't fuck it up

"I've been through some rough times now, just entered college and couldn't talk to anyone for a while... Against all the odds, I managed to befriend two great guys, one with an incredibly positive posture and one that shares my pain.

I've been thinking a lot, as always.. and maybe things can change now. I am changing habits, thinking stuff through and making solid routines. Maybe I'm not such a waste of space.

What I mean is, I've been there. And even though it seems like the cause of the suffering will never go away... There is a way to cope with it. In a healthy way.

Maybe you are right that nobody can change your mind about your existential crisis. If God doesn't exist, then there is no right or wrong etc, etc.

I still haven't changed my mind. But maybe, just maybe, I can still be happy.

I guess this was just a vent or something. I don't know. It may sound cliche, but my change in view coincided with the new year's eve, so I may as well grab the chance.

Happy 2017 for you all, and don't be shy to tell yourself to change to the better, even slightly.",5

"So I was married for 8 years, got cheated on the whole time. I pretty much knew it but didn't do anything about it cuz how do you really make someone stop. I tell myself I stayed for the kids but really I think it was just so I didn't have to crawl back to my family. With her I have 1 kid. She had one when I got with her. Then some how we got guardianship of another. But legally I think I'm only reasonable for the 1. I dunno. 

But anyway we have been separated for a few years now. I still live with her for the same reason. Still married to her unfortunately. Wish I had the money for the divorce. So I sleep in the living room while she is with another guy. That doesn't bother me at all. She cheated on me though that I didn't even care when we decided to split up for good. 

I can't get a job right now cuz when I try to she does something to make sure I have to watch the kids instead. Like leave town for 4 days. Her boyfriend refuses to watch them. So I'm such at the house. 

I barely talk to my family cuz of some issues we had a few years ago. Read my posts and you will know. So they won't help me out. 

I never get time to myself and when I tell her I want to get out of the house she pretty much threatens to kick me out and take the phone back they I'm using. So i rarely get to go anywhere. 

I wish I was dead most the time. I take a bunch of pills sometimes to try and end it, but then I feel bad cuz of the kids. But I think they would be better off without me being depressed around them all the time. 

I don't really know what to do anymore. And I'm sure I will get negative comments cuz I'm the only one taking care of the kids, but whatever. I don't care anymore.",4
"I'm not talking about someone saying ""Its all just in your head."" I mean how do you stop someone from flat out denying the existence of depression and anxiety.

My girlfriend's parents believe that depression and anxiety are merely excuses to be lazy. Unfortunately, my girlfriend has been diagnosed with both, and when things get bad, her parents actually are a road block to getting better. Her mother actually slightly understands, and lets her take antidepressants (which she hasn't actually been on the last few months because she is too anxious to go to the pharmacy) but when things go bad, she is on the brink of suicide, and her parents will yell at her for sleeping late, or taking too long in the bathroom, and it only makes things worse. I only want the best for her, and I think getting her parents to understand her situation may help.",4
"All my life, I have been a sycophant trying to be better, because I can't find it within myself. I don't want to be this person, but I don't know how to stand up for myself and fend for the person who I want to be. It's gotten me nowhere. I feel like I am so far behind and get caught up in the past. I need to be someone better, and I need to stop sulking. I feel that every time I try to get better, someone does something petty to set me off, and because of this, I have fallen  into avoiding people. I don't want to be this person, and I'm so scared that I'm falling into a slump that I won't be able to pick myself out of. I can't get scared, and I have to pick myself out of that, or I just won't make it.",5

"I've found that if I keep my energy up, my other depressive symptoms will go away, if they're not too severe that day. My drug of choice is Red Bull. Coffee can do the same if it's strong enough.

"I think the main reason it's so hard for me to overcome my depression is that it's actually a physical illness.  It feels like having a really bad cold or flu all the time - not feeling like getting out of bed, general aches, grogginess, brain fog. Does anyone else feel this way? ",3
"They said they would help me when I felt like this but all I got was âstop feeling sorry for yourselfâ and âjust let yourself be happyâ.
Idk why I even open up to people, it never helps in the end. I don't deserve their help anyway, they shouldn't have to worry about someone like me.

I just want to leave. I'm done living, I hate it. I would rather stop existing then live in the nightmare of my own head.",5
"I feel like I need to get out of the house, but I don't really like my options... They are:

A) Go out to some bars etc. in my local college town and deal with drunk, belligerent college kids.
B) Go to the nearest major city and fight insane traffic.
C) Stay home, play video games, drink, just another night of the same shit...

So I was looking at my friends reddit account for some reason and I came across a post he made here and just wanted to know what I should do. Do I bring it up to him? Obviously I'm going to try and do what I can for him but do I tell him I found his post?,4
"So I guess this started when my dad had his stroke...physically he came out fine, but mentally not so much. He is angry, mentally abusive, short tempered, and has started abusing alcohol like I have never seen him do before in the almost 30 years I've been around. His is still my dad' and I still love him' but it has been a tough couple months. I have drawn the longer of the sticks, because unlike my mother and my sister I don't live at home so I only see him a few times a week, when they have to deal with his abuse everyday. 

I do what I can to be a support for them, I've always been a person who could be strong for another person (especially my mom). She leans on me with all her problems (financial and mental) mostly dealing with her depression that stem back to losing her own mom. It doesn't bother me when she calls me sad because usually she just needs to vent and everything is ok. 

But now its different

One, it's not just my mom calling it's my sister also, who I have never had to worry about because she is a mentally strong person, but now I feel my dad is breaking her down and she isn't strong enough to deal with my dad and be the shoulder for my mom who is starting to spiral. Two, my mom will not seek help (even though she has in the past), and my sister mentioned she has been making suicidal comments (which I'm not sure if she did that when she first dealt with depression, I was pretty young and don't remember). 

We are a fairly poor family who has managed to get by, but it's not like we can afford a psychologist. Which is part of the reason I have taken the role of being the person everyone in the family vents to. 

So I guess what I'm asking the reddit community if anyone takes the time to read all this is....

1. Has anyone dealt with a stroke victim like this before and how did they handle it.
2. How do I keep my younger sister sane when she means so much to me, and I hate to see her fall into depression like my mom has in the past
3. How do I get my mom to seek whatever help is out there, and are there any freeish psychs out there that help people who are in a deep state of depression.
4. How do I try to stay strong when my entire family is falling apart and I feel so helpless and scared.

Sorry for the probably million misspellings, it's been a long day and I'm tired. 

Thanks to anybody who has been through something similiar and can possibly help. Part of this might just be I needed to vent, and had no one to turn to. Thanks to reddit, when you can't turn to anyone now you can turn to everyone.

P.S. if you are a depressed person seak help, it's not selfish, it's not just sadness, it's a disease. ",3

"I never knew my father he left before i was born. My mother told me he started a charity for boys without father's after he left that and his first name is all i know about him. Four years ago my mom and stepfather made a move overseas from my home country. The transition has been difficult i feel alienated and haven't made any friends for four years other than brief online relationships.

Unfortunately the move also took me out of school past the age of 13 i haven't had an education. My mom is to busy to maintain homeschool and my stepdad doesn't care for me as he does my mom. I was born in another country and he already has two children of his own I guess this is why he doesn't pay attention to me.

It's hard being alone or feeling that way I've always wanted to meet someone my own age I dream of it. Some days i wake up and I'll sneak out of the house to the park and hope to meet someone. I haven't yet. My 18th birthday is happening this year and that's a big number to me but I'm afraid nothing is going to change its like I'm stuck in a purgatory while everyone else gets to go to school and have friends get a job. 

I'm in a village with a handful of houses in a country i wasnt born in. I have dreams and I even turned my room into a little acomplishement zone to achieve mini goals so that one day I'll be able to accomplish those dreams.

Sometimes things just seem unfair i feel like I'm chipping away at a granite wall with a plastic spoon. My parents dont listen for years i begged them for an activity or something to give me growth and interaction with other kids it never happened. What's the purpose for all this happening why have i been put in a time of obscurity for this long?

Sorry for the rant has anyone had a similar experience of being alone like this. I'm sure alot of people who grew up homeschooled experienced what im feeling.",4
"I have severe PTSD, brought on by events that happened to me in the military.

I have an eating disorder, body dysmorphia, and Asperger's too.


I also have zero support group.  I have a therapist I see when he has an opening for me (shitty insurance), and that's about it.

And this year has been hell.

I live with a 60 year old male room-mate who has 5 cats and 2 fish tanks and refuses to take care of them after promising he would.  He also likes to watch porn and ... yeah ... in the living room.  He refuses to understand even a fraction of what it's like to live with the shit in my head.  I'm constantly being asked ""why do you get so mad?"" His other favorite thing to say is ""stop using your PTSD as an excuse.""  What the fuck?  An excuse?  I have never used *anything* as an excuse in my entire fucking life, you asshole.

I have no friends.  I have no family.  I am fucking isolated where I am, and with no way out.  I've got 5k in debt I'm trying to get paid off, and I'm on SSDI, so I can't afford a place of my own.  I also have a piece of shit Jeep that needs serious mechanical work.

I just .... I'm struggling, you know?  I'm fucking struggling, and I thought being on Reddit and writing for a certain community would get this shit out of my head but it hasn't.  I've got more people that hate me than like me.  I can't seem to do *anything* right.  You'd think at my age I'd have my shit together, but I fucking don't.  No matter how hard I try, I fuck up.  I fail.  I don't fit in anywhere.  I don't belong.

"the last year has been awful for me. my wife dumped me early in the year and moved with our son abroad for a few months. Subsequently, as a result of my bad emotional state, I lost my job. I got kicked out of the house we were renting and later had to leave a flat I rented (neither was financial reasons) and had to move in temporarily with my parents and have slept on the couch in the living room for a few months now, not getting enough sleep and having no privacy, but I have no alternatives. I got depressed and I'm on antidepressants. I also got pretty sick, some significant limitations, surgery was on the table, still might be, but hopefully not. Also, I had the worst phases of tinnitus in my life recently and it drove me insane. I have 2 favorite hobbies that I need my right hand for, but I got a nasty inflammation in my right hand, so I can't do my favorite hobbies. I lost a solid 35 pounds in 4 months because of depression. I felt better recently after being on antidepressants, found a girl that I like a lot and we had a trip planned, long distance relationship. I was looking forward to it for a long time, but I got sick again today and had to cancel and since this was the week when she had time off from work, God knows when there'll be time again. I also worry that I will lose her for some reason now, being pathetic as I am atm. And I feel like that was the last drop. I sincerely don't feel like going on after all of this, there is just no point in anything anymore. I'm so disappointed by getting sick again after struggling with health so much lately. Disappointed by not getting to spent intimate time with this girl again. I spent a month in bed just now and I'm already sick again. Wife started pushing hard for divorce on Christmas eve of all days (we were keeping this for when things calm down a bit, as it's just a formality to us at this point). Today she visited my parents and went full passive-aggressive on me, brought back bad flashbacks. My mom, who's my closest person in all of this... we have a slightly complicated relationship. She's kind of a low key feminist and she has a tendency to take my ex's side by default, identifying with her as she is also a divorced woman and she never entirely dealt with that. She was pretty cold today in communication with me after my ex's visit today and it got to me. And I apparently can't sleep, so I took sleeping pills and I'm starting to feel super sleepy as I'm typing this. Also, I noticed I suffer from forgetfulness and have trouble concentrating or falling asleep after starting to take antidepressants, which scares me. Overall, I'm just not sure anymore. The only positives in my life atm are my mom's support and being able to look forward to spending time with this girl and both things just went out the window and I feel like... what's the point in going on? IDK if there is any, IDK. I have to stop typing now as the sleeping pills are taking over, but just believe me when I say that this isn't even close to everything that has brought me into depression, it was just an awful year for me in many ways. Even with antidepressants and therapy, it's all too much now. Way too much. I find my self thinking over and over again that I don't want to have to do this anymore, I just wanna die. I can't get hospitalized or anything like that for this depression, as I need to financially support myself, my kid and my ex, since I'm the only one making money and I don't have anybody in my environment who could support me in any way in this regard. I just don't want to anymore. I wish I could get 3 or 4 good days, just a break and have things go well for a change. But I've been wishing for that since a long time and yet, here I am.

"A big issue I have with my depression is my inability to keep my house clean. I have lived in clean homes my entire life. I know how to clean and keep things clean. When I am a guest at a hotel or a friend's house I clean up and keep my space tidy. My house is a completely different matter. I have learned that it is because of my depression that my house is like this. I live alone and so it is up to me, alone, to keep my house clean.

For the new year I want to make the resolution to clean my house and make it organized and keep it that way. I recently started taking Zoloft and I've noticed that I'm able to keep things picked up. For example I take my used dish and put it in the sink (I have a pile of dishes to do so we're just going to focus on the fact that I took the dish down in the first place instead of keeping it in my room).

I get overwhelmed when I have to clean a lot. Partly because my grandparents were so completely anal about cleaning that it's almost my little rebellion. However, I know that I can do 15 minutes a day. I have done it, I just haven't been able to keep the habit up. I want to make that habit and keep it going.

"Hi guys, so long story short I broke down in front of my parents twice in the last 10 days and poured my mind out (ugly crying, snotty and all, a wreck), told them everything.

I'm actually kind of curious what it's like (although I know that once it will be time to go I will shit myself).

Should I tell her I wanna die ? Or will that lend me in a ward ? 

Should I take pills even tho I keep reading how people regret ever getting them and want to get off them and the withdrawals are the worst thing they have ever had to go through ? It kind of discourages me..

I kept my cool, but when I asked if I could use my boss as a reference she said âwe can talk about that later.â I've been seeing a therapist since the day I stood up for myself, just before they let me go though. The therapist is great and I understand that my old boss was manipulative, unfair, and just a shitty person. Still, as the sole breadwinner for my husband and kids I felt like I had been punched in the gut and the feeling hasn't really gone away yet. 

My husband is going back to school and also takes care of our 2 girls ages 2.5 and 5 years. He is getting better at being supportive but is pretty much the most unemotional person I've ever met. He doesn't understand that my depression is not a choice. Why on earth would anyone want to feel this way? My psychiatrist and therapist keep emphasizing that I practice self care and give myself space but whenever I ask if I can just be alone for a bit, or go out with friends, my husband acts resentful. 

In late November I started a new temporary position whoch should go through March, and all I do is go to work, come home to a crazy house (we also live with my loud, dumb, &amp; chatty af mother-in-law) and then go to bed when the kids finally concede. I feel fine at work, almost good sometimes, but as soon as I come home I feel totally overwhelmed. I have few escapes and I find myself wishing I could disappear from the world and that my family would magically forget me so that they wouldn't be hurt and I wouldn't scar my kids for life. 

Tonight I brought up taking a class I really want to take two nights a week, which would mean I wouldn't get home until after the kids are asleep, and one of those nights my MIL or my parents would need to watch the girls for a few hours. My husband's reaction was basically through gritted teeth âit would make a lot of things unnecessarily hard, but if you feel like it's what you need to do...â

So the words were ok, but the way they were said changed the message entirely. Like I said, he doesn't have/process emotions well so I'm trying to tell myself that he just isn't aware that his resentment seeps into things all the time and ruins them. Straightforward- âI think it's too much,â compromising- â how can we work around the schedule conflict?â Or ACTUAL support- âI know you need to something for yourself.â Would all be fine, but saying something vaguely supportive with a hostile attitude feels manipulative. I keep wishing I could just go to my mom's house for the first time in my adult life because there even though my parents are weird they also can just be straightforward or supportive without emotional strings.

So tonight I went into my space-out mode after the class conversation, which then turned to silent sobbing. Couldn't read to my kids because I was crying and they couldn't understand me, couldn't do anything. Husband just sat around with me and the kids, never asked if I needed something, or wanted to be alone for a bit. No acknowledgement whatsoever about the fact that for over an hour I sobbed while it upset my kids. The lack of response is almost worse than the conflicted responses, but both leave me feeling utterly alone and wanting to die. There. I fucking said it.

So here I am. On Reddit. I can't imagine anyone actually reading this, and the truth is what difference would it make? If you are reading this, thank you. I hope that you are coping with your challenges better than I am, and that you have someone who can support you in the ways you need. 

Here's to a new year.",2
"âWe get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking.â
â Albert Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus

I feel like this is the only reason I'm alive right now - because its just a habit. I feel like I want to die but I'm too lazy to really do anything about it, so I just keep living and distracting myself from my reality. ",5
"A bit of background: I've been struggling for 5 years with severe depression and I'm currently in my 3rd year of college. My main drive in life has been to eventually get a job over-seas (mainly anything involving national security or humanitarian aide) to help people around the world however I can. Currently studying Political Science with a minor on International Relations and have plans to continue through law-school. 

Thing is, I'm getting really restless along the way. I have a future job in mind that only requires a bachelor's degree but I'm afraid that a degree on Political Science won't really get me anywhere in the long run so I should have a law degree to back it up just in case things don't go as planned.

I've also considered going on student exchanges but due to economic problems in my family, we've had to prioritize our expenses on other necessities. I live in Puerto Rico so we've also had to deal with the aftermath of hurricane Maria; university's been delayed for months so any chances for internships clashed with the semester's new schedule. Due to all of this, I haven't been able to fulfill that desire to travel.

I feel like there's so much going on around the world and the fact that I'm stuck for a couple more years buried in lectures is killing my motivation. I've tried to distract myself through different hobbies, volunteer work and going out with friends but nothing's genuinely helping.

Don't wanna drop out of college at all but I'm finding the road ahead really tedious. I'd like to hear how any of you have dealt with a similar kind of rut and how I could maybe find that drive again to not let my grades go down cause of my depression.

Thanks for reading and happy new year

"I've called my best friend with best wishes on New year eve. We're living 8hs ride from each other and we see very rarely. Anyway when I called him he told me I saved his life becasue he was about to kill himself. I'm depressed for 6 years and after therapy AND on meds myself but there is one major differece between us. He was(Is) drug additct i was not. Im calling him every single minute I can get. And here's my question. How can i convince him into rehab/further therapy? He's also on meds but they dont seem to work because of drugs.

"I don't visit this subreddit that often, but every time I do I leave feeling like I don't belong; I feel like I'm just a whole lot weaker than anybody else here.

I read the posts and stories that all of you are going through or have gone though and despite being able to relate to a certain degree, it doesn't feel like I've gone through it to the same degree that you've all dealt with. I feel like a fraud, like I'm just another millennial feeling down on his luck and glamorizing the idea of having depression because it's easier than admitting I'm some sort of a brat unable to pull myself through some shitty times.

I just entered a new phase of depression. Cant go to sleep when i am not extremely tired because of thoughts. My mind is cluttered with great amount of sadness and anxiety and when I lie down I just cant make it quiet so I stay up until morning . I dont think I will be able to go on much longer,5
"I thought I was okay I thought it was all just episodes but fuck this too much. It's new years, I'm supposed to celebrate with friends but all fucking alone. My dad had to call just to make sure someone told me happy New Year's.

I am diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder and take medicine but it does not help. I had a lot of therapy but nothing helped.
All my thoughts are going round the same topic: what can I do today to help myself? Meditation? Active things? Take a bath? Read a book? What should I do?!?! And this repeats till I go to bed again and my results are that I did nothing. Lol. How can I break this crazy cycle? ",5
"I've got fired from my part-time job, what kind of bastards firing his own staff on the end of a year?

Then all of people who made me rush down to hell gonna regret what they've done to me. I feel like this is my end of everything. I've got, literally, nothing. Wanna be dead in my tattered blankets.

"Sure, they make the depression go away. But it doesn't fix it... antidepressants just make you numb. The reason you don't feel depressed is cuz you don't feel anything. And you're mind then tells you that you're better off being depressed rather than being a soulless shell of your former self.
At least that's my experience ",3
"Besides my therapist, the only person I really open up to in a serious way is my best friend. Only one out of my tons of friends. For everyone else, I only talk about depression in a comedic manner, making jokes about it and laughing. I do that because I feel I'm supposed to be the fun one in the group, and while I think I am (I always make them and myself laugh), if I get super serious they'll either make fun of me, stop being my friend, or get super worried and tell someone. I don't want any of those to happen.

Anyway, back to my best friend. Since she's the one I'm serious with, I constantly talk to her about things that bother me, my true feelings, and how suicidal I am. I'm starting to feel like I'm being a nuisance, constantly talking to her about these dark things. She doesn't need to hear all of that. She pities me, as do all of my other friends. I really don't want to annoy her with how much I've been telling her.

Recently, she even said that she feels very depressed, and she's been talking to me about it. She never mentioned me doing anything to make her feel like that, but I feel like I was a part in it. My texts probably affected her a lot. It hurts to think that, but I feel that's the truth. Anyway, sorry about how long this was. I could go on and on about this, so I hope you understand. ",4

I want to just kill myself

Everyday I have thoughts saying just do it, do it, i want to die.
Just do it.

But it's so hard for me. e.g. i have a 13  year old cousin (Single child) who looks up to me and thinks i'm the boss.  If i kill myself how would he feel? what am i supposed to do?",2
"I was telling my mother today that I don't feel like doing anything, and she asked me if I just wanna sit by the computer all day. I told her yes, just because it's easier than explaining that when I say I don't wanna do anything, I mean it literally. I don't wanna sit by the computer all day, I don't wanna lie in bed staring at the ceiling, I don't even want to die. I just don't want to exist.

Anyway, just found that kinda amusing. Anyone else get annoyed by the fact that the only way to stop existing is to die?",5

Maybe I'm desperately trying to give my problems a name I'm faking and believing a depression? Idk. I'm so confused. Any idea what this can be?",3
"Seriously... I've fucking tried everything. Therapy, medication, books, etc. 

Is this dark voice in my head that tries to spit on everything good in my life ever going to disappear, or am I just doomed? Is all this my own fault? Will it keep creating problems that don't really exist and scare everyone in my life away? Am I just destined to keep relapsing?

"On New Years Eve, I was so convinced that I was going to spend it alone. And I was going to end my meaningless life on new year. 

I ended up spending it with my boyfriend, who made me realised that I was actually cared for, and loved, and gave me a chance at believing that I would have a future in front of me. Letting someone be the reason for me to live isn't going to be good in the long run, but as for now, it's good enough. I actually want to stick around and see what happens. Maybe it's going to turn out fine, and not as bad as my thoughts were telling me. 

He held my face and made me look into his eyes. He whispered that he loves me and didn't want me to leave. He said that he will never ever find anyone else. I don't know why or how, but it was as if he knew what was going through my head. I never told him my plans after all. I felt bad and wanted to cry. He made me promise that I am never going to leave him alone. He knew. He is a precious and beautiful person. I cant bear ever breaking his heart and destroying his life. I've decided that I'm going to try my hardest to commit to having a good life with him. I just don't want to pass my suffering onto anyone. I know what that's like. 

Having said that, i'm always scared and anxious that I won't have the strength to fight my demons. I know that he would always be there for me and not let me fight my battles alone. And sometimes I'm scared that he might leave, and I wouldn't know what else to do. I just want to be happy with the person I love. I hope that 2018 allows me to do that. ",4

"It's new years but that hasn't sparked this post. This post was created out of loneliness. I always find myself feeling so stupid, but I am just not satisfied and if i'm stupid so be it. I thought getting financial freedom would bring me happiness, and it hasn't. I'm even more sad now that I have no obligations. I just keep thinking about the point to anything, and I can never find it. The only thing that keeps me happy is listening to very old vocaloid songs, but no one ever wants to listen to vocaloid with me. It makes sense though, i'm a 21 year old man now and it doesn't make sense for me to enjoy such a dumb and girly and cringy type of music, I get it. I just sit around these days listening to vocaloid or electronic music longing for the days back in middle school and highschool when I wasn't aware of how irrelevent these types of music were around me. When I got lost in these worlds and had no cares in the world. I don't like most people. I don't know what to do now. Years of isolation to become financially free and no happiness to gain from it.",4

If I tried washing them they'd end up at the corner of my bed, not folded just there.

I can see my floor. My clothes bins are full, the washer and dryer are full. My bed is made, I  never make my bed. I'm throwing things I don't need away. I'm organizing. I'm in a really good mood and cleaning makes me feel so much better.

"I've been depressed since I was 18 and I'm 26 today. If I could point at something that's causing my depression, I would say that it's my lack of physical contact with other humans. I feel so lonely, and it keeps getting worse the older I get. Treatment hasn't helped.

So if I were to test, if this is infact what is causing it, how could I go about it? In my dreamworld I would have 30min sessions, a couple of times a week where I snuggle to tv-series with a girl. But of course this is impossible to do. 

What came first the chicken or the egg?

Maybe I'm just thinking too much about my depression, it could be very well be that my depression came first which is why it's impossible for me to find a partner.

Has anyone had several years of no human contact, and then found a bf/gf only to have the depression continue uninterrupted?",5
Causing the only people who care about me to be driven away only making me more depressed. I just want it all to end and feel happy once more so badly ,5
"I'm hurting myself again. This always happens when I come home for holidays/time off and spend it with family but have nothing to do to or talk to take my mind off things. I relapse.

I still get lost, especially when I go to bed, but I'm not bombarded with constant reminders of stuff that hurt me.

This holiday was worth than normal and I started to cut again. I started to think about suicide again, and that hasn't happened in several years. I'm not going to act on it or anything, but it was an appealing thought last night. And I'm scared. I'm scared that not only of relapsing for good, but also that this means I can't come home for family anymore. I can't come back to this place. Its fucking torture.",5
Happy new YOU to everyone on this sub. Let's make this happen guys.,0
severely suicidal. My doctors want me in the hospital but I refuse to go. been there done that it doesn't help. they want to tinker with my meditation. Im considering ect as a last resort. anyone here have it done? how was it? did it help? I won't make it if I continue to feel this way. This is the worst i've ever been.

"I'm feeling pretty bad most of the time lately.

I have my ups and downs like every normal person but I feel 'down' 90/95% of the time. I dont think this is healthy.

Lately every morning when I wake up I have this ANNOYING tingly feeling in my intensities. The same feeling you get when you're weightless (freefalling).

Also, I have a very negative thought pattern. I always look back on events (doesnt matter how small or big) and think negatively, or how it impacts me in a negative manner. This is also a very big part of my social anxiety. I always look back and think about the shit that makes me appear fucked-up instead of the things that make me appear awesome. 

I cant get out of bed easily, I avoid most social situations, I smoke weed daily and cant stop, I take drugs (one or a combo of the following: alcohol/ghb/2cb/nitrous/speed/4fmp/xtc/mdma/cocaine/ketamine) every weekend, I cant get a girlfriend because of my anxiety while my friends and siblings can, Even the fucking gym doesnt really
help either because I cant gain more muscle mass after my plateau. (Workout for 2.5 years, first year gained like 43 pounds while staying low bodyfat in the 1.5years, but stayed the same last full year eventhough I put in as much work as I always did)

All of this is making me incredibly sad. The drugs are the only fun thing I do. And video games occasionally but they dont entertain me as much as they did 2/3 years back.

Im 19 years old and I am thinking about calling a psychologist monday morning next week. Mainly because of my social anxiety and anger attacks (another emotionally-selfdestructive problem of mine), but I feel like I am slipping into a depression aswel. Any thoughts?

Ps: thankyou for reading all of this.

"I've been sitting here for close to an hour trying to write something because I have been told talking about this stuff helps, but I don't have anyone to go to so here I am.

I recently started grad school which, being honest, has been a great time. That's probably the scariest part. The fact that I can still be so happy at times and immediately crash in the same day. I moved quite a few states over so I am basically restarting my life which isn't too hard considering I really only had one friend and a girlfriend back home (let's called them S and A respectively), but the longer I've been here, the lonelier I got. Sure I've been making a new friend here or there, but it just feels like it's because we've all been forced to move here and deal with it.

I've been trying to talk to S and A whenever I feel down, but they're both starting med school so they're typically busy. That and I always feel awful asking people for help so usually I'll just pretend like I'm okay so really I only tell them about maybe 10% of what's going on.

Well A dumped me on Christmas (talk about cliche, eh?) so there goes that. I guess that explains why she's hardly been responding to me the past month or so. And I tried talking to S about how awful I felt and her response was essentially, ""You need to get more friends because it exhausting being the only one who can help you."" So after a couple weeks of building up the courage to finally talk to S about how depressed I am, she just tells me she can't help me because she's too busy. Her only advice was to ""stay positive because things will get better"" even though I literally can't think positively right now. Feelsgoodman.

This is where it gets really hard. Yes I could always turn to family, but I've never been open with my family and I just can't. I know it's what I should do, but it was physically painful opening up to my friend let alone my entire family. I just can't bring myself to ask them for help.

I've been having suicidal thoughts ever since I moved to my grad school but I just shrugged them off before as me just being melodramatic and having a dark sense of humor. Well now I can't shrug them off no matter what I do. I would comfort myself by repeating the reasons why I wouldn't kill myself. My girlfriend would be horrified. My family would be devastated. My colleagues would be upset. But now all these reasons just fade away and all I'm left with is ""my parents spent too much money on me to let it go to waste."" That's it. That's the only reason I won't actually kill myself.

I've been trying to motivate myself with the future, but that doesn't work. There's nothing I really want to do. No goals I have to achieve, no plans I want to make, no where I need to travel to. I just keep coming back to the money my parents invested in me. That's all I am right now. An investment.

Is it a shitty life? Yea, probably. I would love to enjoy my life, but all I can hope for now is to eventually be useful somehow and better our world.

I'm sorry if it was barely coherent. I lost my train of thought quite a few times. I think the total time it took me to write this was around 2 hours because I kept having to force myself to continue.

Sorry it's such a long post. I just needed someone to go to because I don't have anyone right now.",4

"I have just moved in with my gf in December, graduated a year ago and have begun working in a company. The company's a successful growth company.

I have liked to work there, but there are some problems. I had a conversation with my bosses about my performance, and they said that they're not sure if I will get to continue there after the test period.

I don't mind criticism, I know I can do better, but f.ex. right now I've been in a flu for about 3 weeks, and my boss has suggested that I shouldn't have a day off even though I would feel like it.

Everything about this situation makes me feel pressurised, and I wake up every morning feeling reluctant to go to work. It's not nice to feel like every day matters at work, when normal routines are starting to feel like effort.

When I get home from work, I usually just slob on the couch and watch comedies or other funny videos to feel better. I sleep quite ok, could do with a few more hours.

I'm grateful to have gotten an opportunity to work in such a successful company. After all, in these times, even getting work is not certain.

I have been depressed before. At that time, I was just 18 and trying to figure out what the hell was I doing. Ended up quitting my job then.

Tl;dr: I work at a successful place, just moved in with gf. Felling pressure to do more at work, and at the same time feeling I should have time with myself. Would appreciate tips on how to get over this feeling.

"In all honesty I'm not quite at the end of my rope, but I am doing pretty damn badly and I will be there one day if things don't change. I can barely talk to anyone, there's a barrier of thoughts, feelings and behaviours in my head and it makes me feel depressed all the time. CBT seems like it would help me so much, but I have no energy or focus or bother to stick with it or believe in it.

 I don't want medication to be a crutch. I want it to be a stepping stone up. I know I can be okay. I'm already somewhat half-okay, I'm on the right track, I just need to be able to change a few core behaviours and thoughts. On paper, medication would help with this. But the more I read, the more shit-scared I get. Seems like there's almost nothing but negative experiences online. Side effects, people literally becoming dumber/having cognitive impairment, people losing sexual function for months, years, sometimes forever, SSRIs being glorified placebos with side effects, heroin-like withdrawals, people tapering off and having their depression/anxiety later come back doubled, etc. It all just seems like some impossible insidious trap. The more I read the more I almost cannot believe these are prescribed.

 I'm not trying to be a fear-monger here. I've read some best-case scenarios of people going on medication, switching across a few until they found one without side effects, staying on it for only a few months or years until things were better, then slowly stepping off them and continuing to be okay, using the techniques and habits they built while on medication. Maybe all the bad things I've read are because people experiencing negative effects are more likely to be on reddit telling others about it. But there's just a sea of negative experiences, side effects and anecdotes out there which are impossible to ignore.

I really want to change and I really want medication to help me use CBT, habits and exercise to bring about change but I'm just so terrified of the possible negative short or long term side effects. The fuck do I do",3
"April 2015. My sister took her life. 

It's been almost 2 years and I sought help a little after she passed. I fooled everyone, including myself, that I was slowly but surely getting better. Truth is, I just kept it locked away, like I always do. Recent events in my life have opened up some wounds, and I'm realizing the depression I felt 10 years ago in high school is still there. Feelings of being a failure, feelings of letting people down, feelings of not wanting to live are resurfacing. I'm not saying I want to take my life, but I don't want to live. Suicide would be cruel to my loved ones because they would have to deal with that twice. But if I didn't wake up tomorrow, I feel like that would be the best from everyone. I'm a miserable person, I'm selfish and I'm toxic. But I'm charismatic and I've hidden all this away for so long so no one knows my true pain.

The truth is, I basically killed my sister. I know that's what many family survivors of suicide say, but I knew my sister had some troubles. She was sad, she had been caught cutting and making suicidal threats for the past couple of years. And yet, I chose to ignore the warning signs because ""If I could get through it, she could."" My dad and her got into an argument one night, and I didn't help her. I even said aloud to my brother, ""She's going to kill herself one day."" A month later, she did. If I wasn't so selfish, I would have helped her, but I just wanted to get on with my life. I'm seeing now, all I bring people is pain. I'm venom. But since I'm friendly and well-liked people still gravitate toward my toxic orbit. The sooner I die, the better off the world will be. ",4

"2017 

Started it jobless. Struggling with everything. I was becoming afraid to even leave my house. Fear and anxiety basically consumed me. 
Medications were basically ruining my life, even after switching, switching, switching. Every one I tried, gave me severe, unusual side effects. (let's stay off this topic, just this was my personal experience and rather not get into it)

Toxic home life, even though I got myself out of situations quick as could.. the new home would end up being toxic as well.
I went into debt trying to not be homeless. 
I disappeared a lot socially. Sleep a lot. Eat too little. Eat too much. That same old stuff.

But I kept going to therapy. Even if it took me several months to go back. Sorry I avoided you Sharon for almost a year, you are a wonderful therapist.
She told me not long ago, that she thought I didn't need therapy anymore.
I used to hate it. But I would go. I would end sessions by sitting in my car crying and trembling from letting myself be vulnerable. 

Slowly, it got better. Slowly, I got better. I'm still terrible at talking her advice, but we worked on a lot. I didn't want to end therapy, I said I still have lot more to work on. But looking back, I think she is right. I don't need it anymore, least for now. (though I do intend of doing check-up sessions here and there or when Im struggling lot more again)

I got a job at a nearby store that I loved and would frequent when I could. 
It changed my life working there. It's not anything special perhaps to most people, but I met the most wonderful coworkers and management that really, truly do care about you and try their best to work with you and your needs. 
I ended up being able to work a second job for seasonal, though they say they will probably keep me, and I didn't know how I was going to make it through the week working so much.
But I am glad I did. I'm able to live alone in a small rental mother-in-law home. I started to live here with a friend I had since 4th grade.
I know her true colors now, and after much fighting, she finally left and got all her stuff few days ago. Needless to say, I hope I never see her again. 

I'm on my own here now.

I got groceries for the first time in a long time on my own without any help.

I have a new bed to sleep in, no longer my old bed from childhood.

My bills for the month are paid for.

I'm doing well on paying my debt off, I'm keeping up. 

I have a great support group now. 

I actually have people I can truly call ""best friend"".

I have a cheerful, wonderful baby nephew that makes any day better.

I don't disappear months at a time now.


I want to cry from how relieved I am.

I think I can finally live not in fear anymore.

For the first time in my entire life at home, I woke up not wanting to hate myself

I woke up wanting to enjoy my day and it doesn't feel like I'm trying to just ""survive""

It's a weird feeling because I feel like I've been running all my life and Im so tired

I can relax and rest, I feel happy

"I'm so confused and fucking afraid. I've always been lonely,  but I accepted it as a kid. That no matter how hard you try, there are just some people who will always be the black sheep. I was fine with it, even though I didn't like it.

But now, I really want to end it. You don't understand, I have this need to run something sharp across my throat, to set myself alight... I feared death to the point where I was scared of going to sleep because maybe I wouldn't wake up. But I can't do it, I can't do it because suicide would shame my family so much that it would destroy my family. If you knew the sort of people they were... you'd understand, they're a whole 'nother level of conservative people.

I feel like I'm going to implode in on myself. I need to vent or fucking something. Iwas never 'abused', beatings are a culture thing so it didn't bother me... but the words? They don't fucking stop, how am I fucking hearing her in the middle of the night, as if she is standing next to me even though she's asleep? There are moments where I feel like I'm looking at myself from an outsiders perspective, and all I see is some over dramatic bitch who is just a fucking coward. A bitch who needs to stop being so fucking mopey when there are other people who went through serious fucking shit. There are people out there who are way more fucking important who deserve my organs to fucking live. A bitch who spends hours searching ways to die but doesn't fucking commit. A coward, a fucking pathetic attention seeking coward. Wow Mum, you're 10/10, 100% right about me. I need to do something I can't deal with this pressure.",5
"Sitting in my dark room, listening to the depression playlist crumbling under my own expectations because I AGAIN underestimated how long this Uni work will need. And now I'm stressed and fell into ""I hate myself""-Spiral again whoopdefuckindoo.

sorry",2
"I don't know that it does much good, for me or anyone else, but I'm going to talk about my situation right now. I just turned 26 a few weeks ago, make decent money working for the military, get straight A's in my college classes, have a loving and supportive family, and am physically fit.
Despite all this, I'm one very sad, lonely bastard. But I didn't used to be...about 3 weeks ago, I was suddenly punched in the soul with a powerful depression that I can't seem to shake. 

Things I enjoyed doing before don't interest me at all. I spend most of my time sitting in bed reading about depression and listening to sad music. Interestingly, the cause of this depression seems to be lonliness. This is strange for me, because I've always been an introvert...I've always preferred to stay alone and would often make up excuses for why I couldn't go do stuff with friends. I've always been very happy and content knowing that I would live, and die, alone. Until now. Now I can't stand the idea of being alone. I want to go out and meet cute girls...but I can't...being introverted is so ingrained in me that I can't seem to go out and meet people. Oh, I've gotten out a couple times...I'll go to a bar, take a seat in the back, drink a couple beers alone then head home without a word to anyone. And then I beat myself up for failing at what I was supposed to do.

 I'll swipe right on a few hundred girls on tinder and get 1...maybe 2 matches. Which takes me into the second part of my issue. I have had an ongoing habitual porn habit since I was 13 years old. I've become so used to the beauty and figures of porn stars that I have a zero percent attraction to most average women. So here I am, a lonely person with standards that rule out all but the best of the fairer gender. How messed up is that? I think ""hey, what about that hefty girl over there, she looks lonely"" and immediately dismiss the idea because appearently I'd rather be miserable and borderline suicidal than settle for a big girl. Yay my brain...thanks bud. 

So anyway...that's about it. Crippling depression getting worse each day because I don't have a hot girlfriend. Does it make sense to you? Me neither...",5
That's it. There's nothing else to it. People just don't want me around I guess.,5
Title,0
"I don't really know why I'm writing this, maybe to help me or maybe to help somebody else. 

As my title says, depression has ruined my life. I've just broken up with my fiancÃ© because she found out I cheated on her. I know that makes me pure scum but it's made me realise how much I'm struggling to cope with life and that I need (and am getting) help. 

I've bottled up my depression for years which lead to ""episodes"". These ranged from assaults (which lead to nights in the cells), drug abuse, alcohol abuse, fits of anger, compulsive lying, erratic behaviour, and, at my lowest, cheating. Each of these came with extreme lows and ever increasing suicidal thoughts. I realised something needed to change soon or I would end it - it was that simple. 

It was my ex that told me to get help. It was my mum that came with me to my first counselling session (2nd one later this week) and to the GP (doctor). Both of these experiences were terrifying but extremely helpful. The GP is going to be putting me on antidepressants as he explained that I needed help with the low feelings I was having. I go back tomorrow once the GP has checked that a previous medical condition won't affect my treatment. 

I'm not sure I'm going to get through this as I'm still thinking about suicide almost every hour, but I'm going to try. I'm not willing to throw away the best 5 years of my life for nothing and I hope when I get better that I can try and rekindle my relationship and give my perfect girl the life she deserves. 

If anyone else is in a dark place right now please reach out to someone - a family member, a friend, a counsellor, a doctor, anyone that can give you the support you need. I can't see light at the end of the tunnel but I know there is a tunnel and that I'll be going through it bit by bit.  To me that's a step in the right direction.  ",3
"Tomorrow I will be going back to school. I am not looking forward to it in the slightest. To hear where and what my classmates have been doing during christmas and NYE, and having to worry about assignments and such. It's gonna be tough. But on the plus side, it will be my last year. Hopefully after that I get lots of time to try and get better. Maybe sooner if I fail. My grades have plummeted during the last year, but I try to not think about it too much. Chances are that my disability combined with my depression will render me unable to work, and I am very fortunate to live in a country where the disabled get financial aid.

Perhaps the NEET life will give me the time I need to find interests and develop a personality beyond that shy, crippled person with few words to spare. I will also hopefully get a driver's license this year or the next. I don't know what I will do with it, but it feels nice to know that I will be able to drive. I like the idea of driving around just for the sake of it. 

2017 was pretty shitty for me. At least in some areas. I had multiple suicide attempts, but none worked. I also had romantic feelings for someone, and I even had visions for a future with them. A happy future. I haven't had something like that in years. I even paid them a visit to meet in person. It was really exciting to travel abroad to meet an online friend. With that being said, we sort of fell apart shortly after I went home. Most likely a combination of my habit of shutting myself away when depressed, in addition to their depression. Maybe we will meet again sometime. 

I'm not really sure what to think about life anymore. I don't feel much sadness. Not like I used to. Just indifference towards everything. Like I don't care about anything anymore. I should be frightened to think that I tried to end my life. Sad that I split from my romantic interest without even a goodbye. Angry at myself for how I treat myself. But there is nothing. I feel like I've experienced what I need to experience. I've been happy. I've had friends. Moments of intense pain. Anger. Sadness. Depression and isolation. A connection to someone else like no other. I am satisfied.

I can die now. ",2
"Probably the most depressing year of my life. This is the year my cat died. The year my parents found out about my depression, we did nothing about it, and now we're moving on as if nothing happened. The year some of my favorite celebrities died. It sounds fucking cheesy saying it, but still, a lot of them entertained me, which, in turn, distracted me. The year of many many terrorist attacks. Here's hoping 2017 will be a better year for all of us. The bar isn't set very high...",5
"Before you begin to read, here is some informations about me:
I'm Alex, 15 year old. I live in a small city, so if somebody does something, next week everybody knows about it. 
I'm suffering from depression for I don't know how many years.
I always was the backup person, so I got ignored a lot.
I remember I just sat in the hallway of my school, alone, noone cared about me. Not even the teachers.
I play a lot of video games, isolated from the others, and I have only a few friend that I can play with.

So, earlier I realised that one of my freind is changed. He does not care about me anymore. He said that he s#its on my depression right in my face and he is trying to ignore me. Wich one is not that good of a feeling.

If I write to him on Steam he sais that he is playing with someone else ALWAYS and then rarely respond to my messages.
--
If I write to him on Messenger he reads it, and doesn't respond to it.

He is that ""I live in my own world and I dictate my own rules in case of friends"" guy.

I had a few problems with him earlier in 2016 and in 2017 too.

Today I asked him a few questions (i'll write it in hungarian, and below that in english):

Me: ÅszintÃ©n: ***** vagy Ã©n? just asking
Me: ?
Him: mindketten a barÃ¡taim vagytok what are u f*** g*y to ask that
Me: nope
Him: csak ***** nem szokott okoskodni
Me: but you have better time playing with him than me, just asking lol
Him: mert ugyan azt szeretjÃ¼k mindketten
Me: kivel jÃ¡tszasz szÃ­vesebben, ez a kÃ©rdÃ©s vagy napok Ã³ta a fejemben van
Me: ?
Him: *****
Him: mivel Å nem okoskodik mint te
Me: vÃ©letlen kilÃ©ptem tsrÅl lol ( totally was on purpose)
Me: akkor have fun with him, in the rest of  your life

in english:
--
Me: To be honest, *** or me?
Me: ?
Him: You are both friends, what are you f****** g*y to ask that
Me: Nope
Him: Just **** does not complain that much as you do.
Me: But you have better time playing with ****than me, just asking (because I realise it)
Him: Because we love the same (game) both
Me: Who do you prefer playing with? (me or ***)? This question is in my head for days.
Him: *****
Him: Because he does not complain that much as you.
Me: Accidentally left from teamspeak (it was totally on purpose)
Me: Than have fun playing with *****, in the rest of your life.

What is the right thing to do in this situation? Did I overreacted? I don't know what to do anymore, give me some tips please.",5
"Tonight I was just thinking about everything I could do to just...stop. But I basically just worked up the little bit of courage I had and I finally called. My anxiety was all over the place and I was constantly having panic attacks about it but, I finally did it. It honestly feels weird to be happy though. Even if I should be feeling proud of myself and all it just feels weird to feel happy. But it felt so good to have someone understand everything I told them, and not just shrug it off and act like it's just because of my age or ""just how I am"" because of my past or anxiety getting to me. It feels so nice to have someone actually understand me for once, and understand what's happening, and how my situation is. We talked for about 40 minutes and she had a really strong accent but, it was nice. My anxiety eventually faded away, and she helped more than my own family could.

I finally feel happy though, and that's all that matters to me right now. ",5
"The more I sit back and think. The more I realize that I'll never recover from the psychological damage both high school and college have caused me.

People were just downright awful to me in high school. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused by shit heads that live in my neighborhood. It's like there mission was to make my life miserable. They ruined my life in every way. They posted humiliating pictures of me online. They beat me up whenever they feel like it. They called me horrible names. You name it they did it. 

My senior year prom date was a complete bitch. She didn't talk to me for the entire night and abandoned me for her friends. Literally everything was perfect we talked every day, I asked her to prom. Then it all went downhill. She never acknowledged me presence in school. She was so rude to me on prom night. I regret following her around like I was some stupid sheep. Should have just left her. I recently snapped and got really mad at her when we didn't talk for awhile. I let her have it and I feel no remorse that I lashed out on her. She deserved it with the hell she put me through. She broke my heart and ruined my prom night. Something I'll never get back.

I had no friends in high school. People would just ignore me. Never asked me for plans. They were all just fake ass people. They always talked to people that were better then me. I was always a second choice. Not even a fucking second choice. 

High school set the stages and fucking destroyed any positive view I have on people. I often stormed out of classes and broke down crying in the guidance office because of how I was treated. Nobody gave a shit. I was sent home one day after having a complete meltdown, throwing a tissue box at my counselor, crying, and getting so mad to the point I almost passed out. I literally hate people. All I have done was be friendly to them and they have to treat me like shit in return. People did some nasty things to me and I was suicidal. Now I come out of high school with an extremely hateful view on people my age. I wanted friends and I still want friends, but literally me getting friends is just super unlikely. So I just sit back and watch the others have fun while I rot.

College? Heh, people told me college would be different. My parents made me go to my local community college and that decision fucked over any chance of me having a normal college social life. I'm mad at my parents to this day for not letting me go to a college I wanted to go to. Now I'll never get to experience the joys of living in a dorm and I don't have any friends for an apartment. I hate college. Nobody at my college talks to each other. It's antisocial and I'm often sitting alone or walking alone. Nobody talks to me. I even approach people in class, nobody talks to me.

Now a little bit about myself. I'm extremely shy. Yes, I've gotten better at it but honestly, this doesn't make a difference because I even talked to people and they still wouldn't act like I'm there.

I also am not much of a partier. I hate parties and I just hate being around drugs and alcohol. It just isn't my kind of fun and I always stay away from it.

Literally laying here in my bed crying which I have been for the last fucking week. I don't have a therapist appointment till Friday. My therapist is too busy to talk too. I honestly don't think I'll make it to Friday. I am becoming suicidal again and I just don't see a point in living through these awful college + high school years. Even if I make it, I'm so psychologically fucked up from high school and college that it will impact me in the future. I don't want to live anymore. I just want to be happy again and sadly I think ending it is the only way as I can't get anything going for me.",1
"Hi there, I'm looking for a best friend, as the post says so. Looking for someone who understands the life of a depressed, and doesn't give stupid advice like ""it's all in your head, you just have to think positive"". Someone who doesn't give up on you no matter what. I'm specifically looking for a best friend instead of friend because most of the time, people don't take online friendships seriously. But I do. My friends are real humans with feelings. I'm ready to invest effort, time and emotions into a friendship that is worth it, even if it's just online :)

A little bit about me, I'm a 23 year old female. INFP, for any myer-briggs fans out there. I'm probably the most emotional person you'll ever see. My heart totally rules my head. But I do have morals which keeps me sane of course. I get attached pretty easily, and I'm pretty clingy. Maybe a bit too much for normal people to handle... But so far I've met some who can handle it :D My interests include writing poems, collecting cute stuff, singing, and thinking about life and possibilities.

"I sometimes wish the world would end. Still here, I am awake, haunted by the sound of a subtle whisper. Though there's nothing left, cities sleeping that never before have heard rest, there's a feeling yearning; aching, hurting inside like pressure in an ear. If there was nobody, would you know? Recalling events of loss, you remember voices you have once heard before this time of nothingness disappearing after their loss... Soon enough you hear the news.
Am I insane? Who is this? Why is this happening? The subtle comfort of solidarity, though terrifying, luls me into comfort, still I hear this voice....
Still here alone..., where? 
We soon make plans.
Rendezvous. 
Nobody cares when. We have all the time in the world right?

The trip was not difficult, just long. Boats and gas are plentiful. Anyone... All two of them could break into the library now... There are so many...

I used to have this wish, and that some way, some how, I would meet her... Still getting played time and time again... I don't think it would end the way I hoped. We wouldn't meet. We wouldn't find love. There would be no hope, Or it would all be insanity from the start",5

the resources used to keep me going could be used on someone who wants to be alive, someone who is a net gain to their community or at least is not a burden, and yet you keep me going. why? 

i'd imagine if you look behind the veil, the reason is simple: losing me would hurt people who actually are a net gain to the world. people who are valuable in every respect, from the economy to socially. the shining stars that are the only reason i remain alive.

this is the true nature of suicide prevention. it isn't about me, i'm a lost cause... it's about not hurting people who actually matter. i know it shouldn't be this way but it just is, i know for a fact i'm not a worthwhile person, i've had it shoved in my face many times recently.

i'm a failure in every respect. if i were to die in an accident tomorrow, the world would be better off, even if nobody wants to admit it. and yet i keep on marching, for those that care about me, for those that would be deeply scarred by my loss... but never for myself. i don't deserve it.

"I used to lead a successful life and was proud of how simple and easy my life had turned into, and I believed that my purpose in life was to show everyone around me how to live successfully without disrespecting anyone or any rules and without cutting corners.  In essence I felt that I held the key to happiness and was eager to share it with anyone who was willing to follow my example.

Unfortunately, 4 years ago I went blind due to a congenital glaucoma, and was totally unprepared for that even though it was highly likely to happen during my lifetime.  At the beginning I was positive about the whole situation, so I went to a blind rehabilitation center thinking that after coming out I would pick up where I left and continue to be an example to others, but I totally underestimated the mental drag that comes with being blind.  I started seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist shortly after going blind, and in 4 years I had 3 psychologists and 2 psychiatrists tel me that I show no signs of clinical depression beyond wanting to die, so I'm not taking any meds.

The problem is that my life is no longer simple like before, as the strategies required to live blind make even the smallest problems a challenge to solve thus creating a huge mental drag that makes everything extremely unpleasant to do, and I know that these problems aren't going away as there is absolutely nothing I or anyone else can do to return my life to what it was.  I'm also no longer an example to anyone as I have become extremely dependent, not because I don't want to do things but rather because I refuse to accept that I'm blind and have to do them differently, so the only way I see out of this is killing myself, but even that becomes much harder to do blind.",3

I feel like a hug could help me(from someone who is not obligated to love me) like from a friend(boy or girl does not matter ) but everytime i try to hug a friend they say mostly ,,Ew"" (Girl) or something about my man boobs (Man)

An example would be for about 4 days ago.At the New year party were pretty much my friends,one was missing he was ill.I was all the time with a girl(also friend of mine)and she and me seem to like each other.I was having fun with her and just found out she chose the guy who was ill(my best friend since pre school).I never tough of me being with her ever since, but since that night i cant sleep anymore

"Last week I got a new phone (Pixel 2, is vewy noice), and as I was setting it up, I realized that outside of family, I had no contacts to add. None. I don't know or have a single friend outside of my family. 

I've just been feeling worse since then. I tried to be optimistic about it, and to have my new year's resolution be some bullshit like ""talk to more people"" but I know that's not going to happen. I'm so socially awkward I can't start a conversation, and nobody wants to talk to me.

I've also thought of talking to a therapist about it, but that will never happen. I can't see myself ever opening up about any of this in person.

I just wish I could be able to literally just fucking talk to other people without being awkward, let alone have a single friend. ",4
"I dread this time of year for myself.

Others talk about their plans, they take pictures and videos of themselves going out, they have kisses at midnight. I'll be at home. Probably eat some chinese food and watch a movie. 

It was like this last year too. Just don't have friends to go out with anywhere. Single. It gnaws at me. I just want to have some fun.

I'm basically mid-twenties now too. So goodbye the miniscule amount of fun times I've had, hello real world. Too old to be going out, and I didn't do a whole lot of that. Also been thinking of mistakes and how much of a loser I am, how everything's fucked up. Another shitty year ends.

Trying not to get too pity party. Hard to do. Just going to be lonely and nothing to do about it.",5
"Ive been on Viibryd for about a year give or take. The first few months I gained about 20lbs and all together ive gained 25lbs( last I knew.) I stopped weighing myself about 2 months ago because it was getting even more depressing. I've read a few forums and have noticed that most people have experienced rapid weight gain with this medication, and no matter how hard they've worked- the weight wont budge. same issue here. I'm ready to ditch this medication because 1. I'm sick of dealing with the weight gain, going to the gym 3-6 times a week has done nothing. 2. it seems to increase my anxiety at times. 3.Its expensive(even with a coupon code and insurance.) The thing is- I'm VERY scared as I know that depression can become harder to treat over time. I tried probably about 8 medications before I found this one- I really thought there was no hope beforehand. I've stuck it out because obviously mental health is more important that weight gain, but the weight gain is causing me to obsess over what I eat/how often I workout. 

Does anyone currently take viibryd? Have you even come off of it, what was it like? I heard the withdrawals are horrible. ",3
"On NYE, I downloaded a habit tracking app. I had tried to make a paper notebook one but just couldn't be motivated to do it.  Technology to the rescue! Yes, it's only be 3 days. And no new habits have been formed. But it's been a good way to make sure I'm doing all the self care things I've been setting aside when I'm having a bad day: flossing, washing face, brushing teeth, drinking enough water, taking Vitamin D etc. At the end of the day (or before work if I'm working swing shift) I go over the list, see what else I can do. There's a nice little feeling of accomplishment when I press the check mark. That's how I'm going to beat this, how I'm going to get to where I feel like I want to live, one small accomplishment at a time.",2
"My depression feels like an overwhelming heavy-ness depleting the motivation, confidence and happiness of my former self. I know all of the ways to fight depression by eating, sleeping, drinking water, meditating well. But majority of the time I can't get myself to do any of those. Smoking pot gets my thoughts racing now on how I continue to fuck up. Continue doing what I Know makes me unhappy. I can't explain it in person. My work is being effected my health is being effected. Idk what to do. Idk who I am. I feel worthless. I feel disconnected. It's like a nightmare clenching onto my dreams. They're screaming to be seen while being taken over by shadows. I have so many plans I must see through but I can't and it fucking sucks. I'm sorry if this isn't appropriate Idk how reddit works I'm just really going downhill and needed to at least write.",5
"I woke up this morning after going to a New Years party last night with people that I genuinely call my closest friends sad and alone. I love my friends but they don't know the real me.

"I want to be succesful but I'm currently struggling with depression/anxiety. I'm 18 and I'm really lost at life, almost dropping out of high school due to the complete utter unmotivation to study whatever comes. And I have no interest in anything probably because of the depression.

"So my ''friends'' made a huge new years party, like the biggest in our small town. I've never been the biggest party type, but a simple text would've been nice. So now january 1st comes and they all want to hang out with me because noone is going out today. I never have had many friends, but i was fine with that, because i only kept the real ones with me. How can i find new people atleast to hang out with? (btw i'm quite a big introvert so i know it won't be easy) ",4
"Let me explain before you claim me to be a psychopath. I have so little control over my life, I do nothing of importance, basically school and Home. My life is a repeating cycle of nothingness. But I do have a choice, a very important one. I have the choice to kill or not.

That choice reminds me that I can make a difference, whether that death be me or someone else. I would *never* do something like that, the thought does scare me. But it brings me comfort to know a can control things, I have a choice. I heard something similar called âcall of the voidâ on a podcast I listen to. Am I just crazy?",5
"I use to be a very antisocial person spending all of my free time alone either watching tv or teaching myself instruments and in high school I became really close to a group of three making us 4. We did everything together from eat lunch to hang out after school to going to concerts and movies and I have to say it was the best time of my life so far. But probably a month or two ago I got into a really bummed out state where I just needed support to get through it. But what did they do, pushed me away and said we don't like being with you when you are sad because it brings the rest of us Down. That of course made me even sadder and they stopped inviting me to hang out with them after school and it's really really hard for me. Specifically one of them has a problem w me and doesn't like me anymore so since he is more alpha than I am, the other two just follow him and push me out. I don't care about repairing my friendship with that one friend because he is an asshole looking back on it, but because of him my other friends won't talk to me. I've been spending most of my time alone in my room thinking about this and I know it's unhealthy and I need to just move on but I can't. I've been friends with them for about 2 1/2 years and it was over like that. I reach out to the other two and tell them how I feel but they won't respond. I need some help because going back to being alone watching tv in my room doesn't do it for me anymore. ",4
"I have a family of  75+ people on my mom's side, and I'm the only gay person. I'm also adopted, but I feel like I've never felt like I fit in in the family. I feel like the odd one out, the outcast, the black sheep. 


Whenever I talk to cousins or other family members, I don't feel like I belong. Also, I'm the only gay person, which I know my very Catholic family won't like when my partner and I get married. I feel like that'll just make things worse and that they'll shun me from the family. 


My parents are very conservative, however my brother and I are very close. He isn't adopted, he's my adoptive parents own kid. He's 28, and I'm 22. We like the same things, many of his friends are my friends, and we just get along so well! He's also non-religious, and has said that he will come to my wedding despite what my parents think or say. 


I'm also non-religious, I don't believe in any gods.

"Earlier during dinner, my parents were discussing an acquaintance whose son was recently diagnosed with cancer and is currently undergoing treatment. Due to my (secret) lack of willingness to live, I said something to the effect of: ""If I was diagnosed with something horrible like that or even a terminal illness, I wouldn't do anything about it. I'd refuse treatment.""

Of course, like most good parents, they didn't like the idea of their son choosing to die in a situation like that, so we began arguing back and forth about it.

It got pretty heated. I was trying to express that everyone should be allowed to make that decision for themselves and have that decision be respected. I still stand by this, of course, but I've always done much better with written words than spoken ones, and so I wasn't able to express my point very clearly. My emotions easily get the best of me, and it's really hard for me *not* to argue, even if I simultaneously believe that arguing usually hurts more than it helps.

And then, despite the argument getting a little more than heated, my dad calmly said something to the effect of ""I understand why you'd make a decision like that, but as your dad, I'd try my hardest to change your mind anyway. I'd never just let you kill yourself. I'd do whatever I had to do to keep you around. I don't know what I'd do if you were dead.""

I got blindsided by that, and I was almost in tears. I could see it on his face. He was truly, deeply terrified of the idea of me not being around. He wants me to live and be happy. For the first time in a long time, I was able to differentiate selfishness from somebody actually caring about me.

After dinner I spent the next half-hour alone, crying in my bed. My parents have no idea about the depression and anxiety I've suffered from the past six or seven years and how I think about killing myself every day, and how much it meant to me to hear that someone actually cared about my well-being.

I've said some bad things about my parents behind their back, and I feel bad about that. Really bad. None of this is their fault, and I need to do better not to blame them for it.

Realistically, I'm not sure if this changes my situation much. It was a simple reminder that there *are* people who care about me, people that are going to be really hurt if I commit suicide. Up until now, this never mattered to me. I was entirely selfish about it. I can't explain it, but hearing and seeing the concern my parents had for my well-being just *made* it matter, I guess. Maybe I do have a heart after all.

For all the time I've been on this board, I don't think I've ever made a positive post, and I just really wanted to share this with somebody. I actually feel a little better, a little more stable after today's events. Thank you for reading.

EDIT: Thank you everybody for responding. I'm glad this resonated with all of you. I'm going to push myself to be more open with my parents from now on.

"So, I want to share my thoughts about this year.

This year I failed nearly all of my classes, for the fifth time. I finally admitted that I am depressed. I also finally admitted that I have gender dysphoria. I started therapy, which is not going well so far. No improvements. I realized that no matter how much I analyze myself and my problems, I will never be able to solve them.

 I spent almost all of my days lying on my bed, doing absolutely nothing but staring to the ceiling. I gained weight. I am already overweight. I exercised less. I read almost nothing. I didn't even play video games.

I have no friends, I made no friends, and I finally lost my only friend. She wasn't reaiiy putting effort, I was making all the plans, and we met only twice, the whole year. I don't think she liked me, she just hung out with me because she didn't want to be rude.

As I said, I started therapy, and I realized that I have gender dysphoria. I have bigger problems. I have lots of bad personality traits. Lots of bad habits. Lots of stuff that HAS to be changed. I wasn't able to make any change.

I . I spent days thinking about it. How it is going to affect me. My days are precious. And I did nothing with them. I was so scared that I will lose them, I wasted them myself.

I lost all my desires, dreams and interests. I had some hobbies that would make me feel fulfilled, no matter how I felt. I stopped doing them. I realized that things are not going to get better. I should stop trying.

I started to hurt myself. I singed my fingertips. I whipped myself with a belt. I hit myself. I scratched myself. Because I am a bad person. I am unable to change how I feel, how my life goes, or how I think. I am powerless. I have no ability to make a difference.

I am not suicidal. There is only one âthingâ that can push me to it. I am prepared to do it painlessly. Unless this âthingâ happens, I am not going to do it. I just hope that I will be able to do it, when the time comes.

So, it got worse this year. Its going to get even worse, I can bet on it. I failed my family. I failed at my life. I failed myself. I totally screwed up. I am responsible for everthing I did, and mostly, everything I didn't do.",3

"I feel like I feel when I imagine dandelions, as their seeds are picked up and float away. It's such a happy scene. But it feels so hopelessly sad. Change... Nothing good ever lasts. I can't hold on.

I'll be 18 in nine months. I already regret my life. All i can do is sit here and let tears stream down my cheeks. I wasted it. And once I leave high school, what? Change is terrible, I FUCKING HATE IT.

I hate being aware, I hate everything that happens. I hate that Ive never been truly understood, and i hate that I'll never be understood. But most of all, I hate that the few good things must come to an end.

What a cruel world, what a cruel existence. So now is where I start to define where I'll go, what I'll do in life, and i can't help but cry. The fun is over. From here, i will lose people, i will lose everything as time keeps speeding up, until i inevitably die and cease to exist.

I just can't do this. Ive been laying in my bed crying for hours, each whine a pang of pain cuts through my head like a knife from the brutal headaches. I feel like such a wimp. I just can't do this. Time just wont stand still! I can't hold on to it, Im losing it all.",5
I'm too much of a pussy to tell my parents that I'm depressed so my New Years resolution is to stop talking about it out loud to people in my life because I feel like I'm burdening them and just repeating the same thing over and over again with no hope for change.

"It's weird because in middle school, I had friends. I attended a different high school than the rest of my friends, so I talked to them less. I started having social anxiety problems around this time as well. Most of my friends started experimenting with drugs and alcohol, but I knew that wasn't for me. Still my social anxiety made me think that because I was different than them in that way, they wouldn't like me as much. I was also scared they'd pressure me into doing it with them. So I started to socially isolate myself. I'm in college now, and I really don't talk to anyone besides my family. I have two people I talk to at my job, but we don't hang out outside of work. I've learned how to keep myself entertained, but now I long for companionship. I still sometimes struggle with my social anxiety and am afraid of putting myself out there only to push people away like I did before. Also I'm kinda shy so it's hard to talk to people lol. Anyone else out there a loner feeling a little lonesome? I'm new to redditt, so I'm hoping I did this right. Take care everyone.",4
"*I apologize in advance for the throwaway and being vague, I feel like this post would do more harm than help if anyone involved were to find it*

**A little backstory:**
My (22m) ex (19f) has a history of depression, much of it deep seeded from experiences in her childhood and a lack of support from her family. For the better half of our relationship (~1.5 year)  it seemed to be fairly under control and she seemed pretty happy. She had meds and was seeing a therapist. I've also struggled with depression for about 3 years now, starting before our relationship. I broke up with her for fairly shallow reasons; I was freaked out about being ""tied down"" having to always consider someone else's emotions and feelings when I can barely take care of my own, and I have huge self-esteem issues. It was obviously very rough but we still care about each other and try to maintain a friendship still.

**What is very concerning to me:** she recently got a new boyfriend and everyone appears to be ok that we still talk as friends to support each other, mainly because we know each other well so it's easy for us to talk openly about personal issues. Very recently however, she messaged me around 1:30 AM and said she needed help, which I've learned is code for she's drunk at a friends and can't stay the night there. Ask her if she called her boyfriend and she says they haven't been talking. Says she can't go home because her parents will flip their shit (which is true). I offer to give her a ride and let her stay at my place and she agrees. 

I knew she had been drinking occasionally with friends but this was completely different. She was almost incoherent and told me during the ride that this was the 5th night in a row that she had drank. While we were dating we rarely drank and if we did it was together, so this was completely irregular behavior. I remember she trailed off one of her sentences by repeating ""I don't know"" over and over while crying. We get to my house (I still live at home) and she's stumbling around and wakes my mom up who I apologize to profusely. We go to my room and she starts crying again and saying some very dark stuff, basically about not wanting to live anymore. I'm very shaken at this point, no longer annoyed and I start crying with her while we just lay on my bed. I had no idea what to say or do so I just kind of held her from behind while she calmed down so she couldn't hit herself or make a lot of noise and wake my parents. When she sobered up a little bit she apologized and said that she ""just didn't care about anything anymore and wanted to disappear"". We fell asleep around 6 AM.

**If you read nothing else, please read this:** We wake up in the afternoon and I take her to her car. Both of us are pretty silent, she was hungover, upset and embarrassed so I try not to say anything insensitive. We part ways and I just go for a long ass drive to clear my head. I have no fucking idea how to deal with this, I can't even take care of myself. I get drunk alone a lot and just don't tell anyone. I lay in bed all fucking day wanting to cry. I don't leave my house unless I have to. But I still care about her and need to help her because who the fuck else will? Her boyfriend is apparently useless, her ""friends"" are terrible fucking influences who don't care about anything besides getting fucked up to hide from their problems and her parents the moodiest people I've ever met. This whole situation has completely thrown me into a hole again because I have no idea what to do for her or myself. I'm not a dad, a therapist or a psychiatrist. I NEED advice to help her before she hurts herself or becomes dependent.

**TL;DR** please read the last paragraph if nothing else, my ex (who I'm still close to) and I both have depression. She has been turning to alcohol to escape her feelings and I am not a dad or therapist and have no idea how to help her before she hurts herself or gets worse *without* seeming like a hypocrite because I do the same damn shit.",4
"I have been depressed for the past 3 years. In the last year my mind descended into the darkest depths. I had thoughts I never could have imagined myself having. However, after a few marijuana-induced ego killing trips, I realized that I was the cause of my own depression. I always thought that this was the hand that the universe dealt me and I would have to continue living a life with no joy. However, this was the way I looked at life because THIS WAS THE WAY I WANTED TO LOOK AT LIFE. I realized that my perception actually created my reality and that all the help that people were offering me was actually genuine. My ego just didn't want to accept the fact that people actually cared about me and therefore I continued to spiral down deeper into depression.

Now, its a New Year and I know what I have to do to better my life, however I need help figuring out how to do it. I am wondering if anyone has any experiences with depression and could give me tips on what they did to slowly rehabilitate themselves to their former mental space before depression. I know I will never be 100% and perfect but right now it's like my mind is a fog and it's slowly clearing but I haven't seen sunshine in so long and part of me still wants to stay in the fog because it's comfortable and I am used to it.",0
"My life feels like a sham. I am 23 years old working basically a dead end job that I have no desire to work in. My original plans were to use my undergraduate to get into professional school but I can't get into any of them so I am on the verge of giving up on those. I probably don't have any aspirations to be in the field I am in but with my parents pressuring me to go into this field, I felt as though I had no other option. I have no real hobbies other than playing mobile games, watching TV/Netflix/YouTube and eating.

I have a few friends but the relationships now feel surface level. I don't know if I could muster up the courage to tell them the extent of my depression. We have discussed bits and pieces of it, but never fully in depth. While the other friendships I have are mainly just hanging out playing video games, talking about music and getting high off weed, that's about it. I find no real joy in things anymore. The activities and things I do try, only remind me of how much of a fuck up I am because of my lack of life experience.

Growing up and currently I am an introvert. My family almost encouraged it becaus I feel as though they didn't know what else to do. I'm not sure how it all started if I'm being honest. It would be so bad that gatherings and social issues events where I didn't know people, I would pretend I was having nausea and hide in the washroom the whole time. Man, as I'm typing this, I'm just really ashamed at what I've become. Over the past few years I've tried to rectify these behaviors and I have seen improvements here and there (I don't hide in the bathroom anymore). However what I'm going to talk about next is probably one of the major reasons why I'm sad.

So in the 23 years of my life, I've never had a real relationship before. There have been moments I go to the club or try online dating where I flirt, but that's the extent of my romantic life. Introversion feeding into my depression has basically paralyzed my mind. Everytime I want to flirt, I switch into a different mode and act shy. At the same time, I try to avoid romance for reasons I've said previous. I'm very depressed with my life and what it's come down to. I don't like the job or the field that I've been planning to do all my life. I have no real hobbies or passions outside of sitting on my ass at home, nor have I developed any real skills. They say confidence is key when approaching women, but my self-esteem is shot to rock bottom and I can never find enough courage to bring myself to ask a girl on a date. On top of that, what happens when I do ask and she says yes, where do we go from there? 

I have family that is Christian but over the past few years I probably align myself as b in agnostic. Because of this, I don't really mesh well with my family and their friends since I'm thinking of completely different perspective. I still live my family and I love them so much, but I realize that this is not helping my situation. All I know is that it's going to take me a long time to save up and move out somewhere.

Speaking of moving out, I make terrible financial decisions. I spend money frivolously on entertainment and food. I also masturbate way too frequently which i know interferes with things such as my social and love life. I'm about 30 lbs over the ideal weight for my age and height but have no resolve or willpower to work out. I've had braces a few times and never ended up keeping the retainers so I still have crooked teeth. I feel like a fuck up every time I look into the mirror because of that. That is something I know I have to life with until I get the money to fix them myself.

That's the other thing about myself. If you haven't noticed by now, a lot of things I want to start or quit, I've never been able to. My will power and resolve is also rock bottom. I've tried working out, stopping masturbating, keeping straight teeth, you name it, I've never committed to anything. I don't know what is wrong with me, I can't keep myself going for more than a week befor relapsing before going back to old ways.

My family has started to notice how mad and sad ive become but have no real suggestions. My parents continually push me towards the field that I have no desire to pursue. I know they mean well, they want me to able to live well within my means. I also know things would be much different growing up in their shoes moving from India to make a better life for themselves and our family. But with that being said, my family doesn't understand how important mental health is for someone. My father treats my mother like absolute crap nowadays, but my mother is too worried about Indian cultures and traditions to do anything about it. My father has always cared about us but my mother has been a different story and I see it killing my mother inside. Again wee are Christian Indians and while it's not unheard of, it is certainly looked down upon. The sad thing is my mother would rather be in this marriage then to live out her days alone. That type of mentality devastates me and I could never possibly resonate with me. Hey it's easy for me to say never being in a relationship but I hope this behaviour isn't condoned regardless. So how could I possibly tell them the extent of my depression?

My life has been set up for me to live a nice and comfortable existence. However, ive managed to fuck that up every possible way down this long road. Ive never thought about seriously ending it all, but the thought has come up on multiple occasions. I know my family would be heartbroken if they were to find out something like that happened, so I guess there's one reason to live. Haven't considered therapy or drugs until now but I'm probably going to go once the new year begins. All I'm seeking now is a road to happiness somehow.",4
"I have great friends and I've been talking to this cute girl who seems to like me, but... ugh. I still feel so lonely. And it just feels inescapable because I have all these people that I should like around me.",5
"On Christmas night my boyfriend of two years broke up with me over text message. I didn't quite figure out what he was saying until the next morning.

We had gotten into an argument because he felt that I wasn't paying attention to him. I disagree. I was paying attention to him. Of course my six year old sister was going to act more excited to see him than a I do on an average day. He's a novelty to her. She thinks he's awesome. She loves when people just exist. She's six. And I made an error with the time that I went to his house, so we only got an hour and a half rather than the two hours I planned for. When we got to my house, he didn't make any effort to do Christmas dinner stuff with me or talk to me. And then he was mad at me for not spending that hour with him when he didn't try spending the hour with me. I tried. I tried to make everything fucking perfect. I was nervous. His family does Christmas differently. This was my chance to show him my traditions and we'd mix our traditions together in our future. I felt like we didn't get to be together much, so I invited him to help my sister try out her telescope. Apparently he didn't want to, but there was no communication. He didn't say anything. I sent my sister inside when we couldn't figure out how to use the telescope. He wouldn't come inside. He quiet-whisper-yelled ""no"" when I asked if he wanted to go inside. He told me that he never wanted to go outside. That I had been ignoring him all day/night. I don't remember everything that I said, but after he accusingly told me that my sister seemed more excited to see me then I have in a long time, I got angry. I told him that he could either come inside or stay outside. His choice.

When I came back outside after composing myself a bit, he was gone. The gift from my parents were sitting on the front steps and he was gone. I was terrified. I am terrified of people just leaving and disappearing without a trace. And he did just that. I texted him to ask where he was while trying to quell the rising panic. He could get hit by a car or get sick from the cold or just completely vanish forever. He replied that he was a good distance down the road. I panicked for a moment while formulating a plan. I went inside and grabbed my keys. I was going to tell my parents and grandparents that I'd be back, but they seemed so happy. I could totally handle this on my own while everything was falling apart.

I drove to the intersection and pulled into an empty parking lot nearby and got out. He was across the street and I wouldn't be able to safely cross right away, so I screamed his name. I'm not really the kind of person to scream, but I was angry and hurt and still panicking. I don't remember everything I said on the drive to his house. I did tell him that no matter how angry I was in previous arguments that I have never and would never just walk away like that. I told him that I wanted to in one, but I purposely left my purse and maybe my shoes so that I couldn't make a rash decision out of anger.

When we parted, he said, ""Over next few days, you should think about whether we should keep fighting for us or not,"" which I responded to with, ""Are you going to?"" I guess I heard it in a condescending way or something. He said of course. He said ""I still love you"" and I told him the same. Then he went into his house and I left and went home absolutely destroyed. I cried a tiny bit, but it wasn't hitting me. Then I got home and saw that my grandparents had just left and I was just devastated. When I came inside I cried into my stepmom's lap for like, ever. When I looked at my phone to say goodnight and send my love, I saw the following...

""I'm sorry the night had to end that way.""

""We're two totally different people and we don't seem to work well together. All we do is hurt each other anymore and it's getting to be draining. I need to get better and you need to get better and we spend too much time working against each other. I'm sorry. I tried. And you did, too. It's time to focus on ourselves.""

And that was sent at 9:15. I got home around 8 or 8:30. It felt like he had already decided early on. That wasn't the couple of days. It was barely an hour.

He then unfriended me and my family on Facebook. This was like, the 27th. We officially broke up on the 26th, I guess.

I don't know if I forgive him. I don't think that I do. I feel like he put the entire night being fucked up on me. Like I should have done better. And I usually tell myself that. I usually tell myself that I should have done this or that. But not this time.

I don't know how to move on or push through or whatever. I miss him and I still love him and I don't want him out of my life forever. I've never been so heartbroken. I feel empty and I am depressed. I've always gone to him. I trusted him. I'm telling myself that now he can go find someone who isn't stupid. Someone who isn't afraid of intimacy. I don't know, someone better. Maybe he wants to just forget about me with my fucked up brain and chemical imbalances and mood disorder like everyone else should. I don't know what to do and I'm really trying to just be happy but I can't. I barely got through New Year's Eve. I tried using positive images to get to sleep last night because I couldn't sleep, but all I could think of was love and how I was a fucking idiot to think that I'd ever find it. Why did I let myself feel?

I know that our relationship was very unhealthy, but I don't want it to be over. ",4

It all started in fifth grade.. It was there I realized what was loneliness and being an outcast. I feel like an outcast honestly everywhere and I feel like garbage of who I am. From 5th grade to (currently)10th grade I have been becoming more and more depressed. At first it just started as sadness from time to time but around 9th grade it really kicked into overdrive. Its gotten to the point where I don't truly laugh anymore or anything not even my own family make me genuinely happy. To make matters worse I probably don't have it as bad as some people here but idk why I can't get that through my head...anyways have a happy new years everyone.. Heres to another year of depression lol. ,1
"I've been battling with severe depression and suicide for as long as I can remember. I dont know what is happening but in pushing myself out. Each day shines a little brighter everyday. I may only be 19 but I'd like to share what I wrote with all of you as well. I love you all and I'm always here if you need someone to talk too.

When I graduated this year I tried to make a little speech. I didn't rehearse it, or plan it and was pretty nervous so it wasn't much of anything. I'd like to try and share again what I said. I said how as we move forward a lot of people expect that life will change so much and become so much better just because you are moving to a new location or part of life but I don't think that's true. The only way life is going to change is by the change in your mind. The movement of the clock doesn't produce newness of life, but the movement of your mind. Everyone is going through a change. To a better level of yourself. Don't let your old habits dictate your life. It is cliche but new year, new you. I'm tired of doing what I used to do, if I always do what I've always done ill always be where I've always been. The real battleground is in your mind, you lie down with it, you wake up with it, go to work with it, you smile in front of others when no one knows whats going on inside. You will never be defeated by what others say about you, but what you say about you. New life comes from a new mind and a new way of looking at your life. For those that are close know I suffered from a lot of depression, and eventually suicidal thoughts this year. I owe so much to my friends and family who supported me. Let this be the year we change our minds. I cannot step into the future and still think in my past, I cannot let the rumors and the stain of what they said about me destroy my opportunity. I cannot drag that same old mess into another year. If you do what is easy, and do what I did and become sad and depressed and let life knock you around life will be hard. But if you do whats hard, and continue to work on yourself and grow life will be easy. Excuses sound best to the people who make them up. God made you and said I want you. You have to be willing to take everything life has to throw at you, but never forget you deserve greatness, no matter where you are now, keep that dream alive. You have to have faith, whatever your dream is you deserve it and it is worth whatever it takes. It was kind of rambled but heres to another year. Take action, don't waste even one more day saying I will do it tomorrow. Do it now. Love life.",5

"If you want to read more about my recent troubles, here is the previous thread I made about 2 weeks ago:
https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5jquj6/i_failed_another_college_class_and_i_dont_know/

But basically I am 23 years old and a computer science major and I have recently just failed another semester of college and told my mother about it. She was disappointed in me and really expressed her disappointment in me.

Whenever I don't distract myself with video games or watching tv I feel miserable about my life and reflect about how much of a failure I think I am. I usually get thoughts about what I would've done differently if I could turn back time and get a sort of existential crisis. 

Sometimes I feel motivated in the morning to improve my life and that I would build up on my resume by trying to learn a new programming language or by working on an app or some coding project I can put on my portfolio but whenever I get stuck I end up losing my will to continue and go back to having my existential crisis.

I have tried following a daily schedule and deleting the games I play on my computer but I end up still distracting myself with other things.

Is there a way to just power through life? I keep telling myself that life gets better and that in the future I'll get married and start my own family and will be happy. But whenever I take some time to think about it I don't really know if its worth it. 

Thanks for reading.",2
"I don't think I've typed here much.. but it's probably going to be my second or third time.
Many years ago I was into a long distance relationship that started with a solid friendship in 2010. After years this guy from Mexico left and  I spent years alone, literally crying until falling asleep. That left in me some serious trust issues. Years later in 2016 I started talking to a guy from Texas. He had gone through a lot of stuff and I felt like I could help him. Things were going right, we were friends and started a long distance relationship I loved. The problem is that he stated changing and we were arguing a lot. My trust issues didn't help either. I became too demanding and he kept ignoring me. One day I broke up with him and I was an idiot thinking he would try to get me back but he didn't. I found out he had someone else. Another long distance relationship. It killed me. I thought he was gone, but during all 2017 he has been typing, sending messages and telling me that he would leave her at some point and would come back because he loves me. He told me he doesn't love her and tried to break up with her (that was true, but she said she was going to kill herself if he leaves her) so he stayed with her. A week ago I got so mad at him for his decision of staying with her that I insulted him. I called him a coward, an idiot and much more. My temper doesn't help much either.
He replied and said he didn't care about me anymore and he blocked me everywhere. I can't sleep. I can't eat, I can't live. 

I think I fucked up and lost the only guy who ever showed some interest in me. I'm dumb, kind of nerd, not pretty and stupid. I don't think I'll get anyone else in probably years since I only had two relationships (both long distance ones) and I had to wait like 3 years for the next one to happen. (the last one I had) 
I think I am doomed to die alone. 
I don't know what to do, I feel so much anxiety. I want to stop feeling things, I'm a failure at these things. I'm horrible with relationships and I wish there was a way for me not to feel anything anymore.

"I finally got the guts to post this, especially because I just came from a new years eve party and it's 4.33 AM and i'm just in a 'fuck it' kind of mode, I need some motivational help.

I feel like im a fucking failure at everything I do, I just turned 18 2 days ago, and time keeps going and going yet it seems I'm always in the same shitty place.
I don't feel okay with myself, i'm kinda short, i'm chubby, and let's face it, no girl wants a guy like that in her life. I just got home from a party just like I said, went over to have fun with some college friends (crush included) and hey, look at that, she's drunk and is spewing the truth through her mouth left and right. I've been 2 months so far gathering courage to just talk to her directly ( we have a group chat on facebook and we talk daily, 24/7 ) and do something about but there's always that mental block of 'hey she doesnt want you you're a loser look at you', and when I finally am about to do something about it, she just starts talking about how 'she misses *name_from_guy_from_our_groupchat *' and shit like that. All that built up courage went down in mere seconds.

And it's not even the first time this happens, I've been this whole summer talking to one of the best girls i've ever met (we know each other for like 4 years but we only talked more seriously this year) and it really felt like she was the one but then again, all that courage i've been building that whole time back then went down again the moment I knew I wasn't going anywhere, seems like I was being friendzoned.
We still talk, I even met her again today in the new years eve party after I left my college friends, but it seems like one day she really likes me but then other days she just ignores me completely, like for example, she gets really pumped up and invites me to the cinema but then she cancels the next day, i don't know her deal. 

I think I'm way too nice and caring but that's just the way I am and I can't stop it that easily, but it's FUCKING up my relationships with girls because I want to be with them but they just assume i'm their good kind friend who doesn't want anything.

I always get motivated and say to myself 'This is the day/month/year, that everything changes, from now on, I'll go to the gym everytime I can and start acting a different way with people blablabla', it works for the first few days or weeks, but it just burns down completely and I end up doing nothing. Endless loop. 

People say you gotta love yourself before you love others, I really need help loving myself then, because I just feel like time is flying away and I'll end up dying single, which is literally hell for me because I care so much about relationships and friends. I'm really grateful for the friends I have, but I just want that one special person to share all my moments with...",4

So, in the past year i've had 3 jobs. In the beginning of 2016, i worked 2 jobs and ended up just not showing up at both due to some personal reasons with my ex around May/June. I didn't get another job until September. So here i am, only working there a few months, and this is the second time i've done a no call no show within 3 weeks. I can't get myself to get out of bed. I just turned 19. I had to have my mom call off for me the other day because i was having a mental breakdown. The jobs i have are not even stressful, but i'm so terrified to actually CALL and talk to a manager and tell them i can't come in, and it's not like being depressed is a work excuse. I go to school full time as well. I technically don't HAVE to work, but i feel useless if i don't. I guess the point of this post is, does anyone have any advice on how to keep a job with depression? Or have any recommendations on jobs? I take medication, so there's nothing else to really help. I'm actually a really hard worker when i don't hit my lows, which is like every few weeks..",2

"Hey guys, first time playing here, just wanted to get some opinions. I've been on a variety of antidepressants over the years, and it seems that when my medication is not fully working I get this unwell feeling in my stomach. I'm not sad or unhappy, and it isn't emotionally triggered, there is just this awful feeling my stomach. It's not an upset stomach, it just feels unwell, and it changes my mood because it's all I can focus on.

 I was on Brintellix for a year and was a miracle drug for me after a year of finding a medication that worked. Symptoms then began about 3 months ago in the form of this unwell feeling in my stomach. We increased the dosage and symptoms went way with the change, and that lasted about 3 months until now. I'm now on Effexor wth mixed results after a month and a half. I take 75MG in the morning but the symptoms arise around the early afternoon. Has anyone ever had similar symptoms linked to their depression?",3
"Been having some weird stuff happen to my personality/mood and I think that it might be depression. The only thing is that I don't really feel sad? Here is a post I made earlier describing what is happening to /r/askdocs


I have noticed or been told things about myself recently that I don't feel are consistent with me in the past. My feelings are dulled, I talk in somewhat of a monotone (people tell me, I can't hear it), and sometimes I don't make any facial expressions so people think that I don't like them when I really do. Often I will be in a social environment and people will say my name to pull me out of a kind of thoughtless trance where I stare off into the distance with a blank mind, I never remember it starting, just being pulled out of it by someone else. I sometimes get asked if I am high when I am stone cold sober.

I have also been having some weird thoughts, like to jump off of a balcony to my death, or violent ones like to stab someone with a knife I am holding or to crash my car on purpose. (I don't want to do either of these things, I will just get a thought like âdo it, stab them in the neckâ or something) I would like to emphasize that I am not suicidal or even unhappy at all. Sometimes I look in the mirror and something looks off about me that I can't put my finger on, I look like someone else. Also different people often ask me âare you ok?â This bugs me because I am always ok, do I have a weird look on my face or something? I never hear them ask other people that, what is wrong with me, it makes me think that I am mentally challenged or something and everyone has been told except for me. There might be more stuff but I can't remember.

All of this stuff has happened in the past year, maybe because of stress? I am a 19 year old male, moved away to college this year so big life change but these things were happening before then also. Help/suggestions much appreciated.


TLDR: I think something is changed with me

"This is my first post and I wanted to know if I could get some advice on this issue I'm having. Just a little back story of myself: I've have depression and anxiety for 10 years after the loss of a parent at 14 but never sought immediate treatment. Last year was when I was official diagnosed. But anyways, 2017 was a really rough year for my anxiety and depression, as I'm sure others can probably empathize, and I kept experiencing one issue after another and it's just completely drained me at this point. Recently I had two close friends that's I've know since HS middle school who both have just entered motherhood (one had just given birth (unplanned) while the other just recently because pregnant (planned). I love them both to pieces even though I don't see them as much and I've tried to educate them on my mental health so they can understand but I don't think it's fully registered on how it works. Now this issue that's in front of me is that the three of us are in our early 20s but I'm not planning on having children no time soon nor do I have much experience with them but I love babies. However when they both told me about this very exciting news that I know meant a lot to them, Instantly triggered me. I felt scared and very sad which makes me look like a piece of shit I know because it sounds selfish. But it's the truth. I was very scared of losing my two close friends because I know I feel like I'll never see them as much and things will change because they'll be busy with their babies also the idea of motherhood terrifies me right now. And I don't have many friends and this made me panic and sad even more. Initially when they both told me their news on separate occasions I didn't display the amount of excitement that I could because I felt numb. They both were aware prior to these events that my depression was getting bad to the point of isolation and lack of communication. I need help! My friends want me to be more supportive but how can I when I don't have the mentally energy anymore to extend myself, I try but it's not enough and I still get shit on for it. Can someone please give me some advice on what to do :( it's making me feel like a really shitty person and a really bad friend even though I've apologized a thousand times :(",4

My spare income goes towards weed, so I can keep myself blithe and functional.  All I can do is go to work in a few hours and pretend everything is cool.  Nothing will ever change.  I'll always be poor.  I'll always be lonely, I'll always be depressed.  The woman I've been talking to is married, and on top of it, I think is close to dumping me for another side guy.  I could be imagining that.  Things have been different for several weeks.  Then since we've gotten closer to the New Year, she distanced herself more and more.  I think she's trying to get me to break up with her so she can move on guilt free.  I don't know.  We barely communicate.  It seems like she has better things to do.

"I really kinda just want to vent a little I guess? I have terrible general and social anxiety that feeds into my depression, and I live a fucking nightmare. I know (because others have told me, however won't say what was said) that people talk about me behind my back. I don't know what they say ever, and I also don't know who does. This is brutal as far as my anxiety goes, and I have a tendency to catastrophize over small things, and it spirals until I'm a dysfunctional mess. More recently, I've been paranoid that none of my friends actually care about me, since they seem to be avoiding me irl more recently. I have friends that are depressed and understand how I feel when it comes to my depression, but they give off the same vibe and I'm at a loss. Beyond that, I'm currently in a really fucked up domestic situation. I haven't seen my dad in coming up on a year now, mainly because he was somewhat emotionally abusive for a while, and I couldn't take it anymore, and my mom and stepdad are always almost 5 hours from me with the exception of holidays. I'm 17, finishing high school while living with my grandparents. I stayed here for 2 reasons: Transferring schools for senior year would suck, and I value my relationships here a lot, but like I said before my relationships seem to be falling apart. Being with my grandparents stresses me out, and it's hard on them too, so I just feel like a burden to them. I talk to 2 different therapists, and I am on 3 different medications for my depression and none of them help. The only time I ever have felt happy recently was the one time I got high smoking weed with a couple friends a few weeks ago. I was in a relationship from May of two years ago until November of this year, and she broke up with me for what I feel like was a bogus reason. I was in a skype call with some people and after a while of not talking I just left because I couldn't handle it anymore and felt like I was just there to feel like people cared about me for once. I didn't feel like they actually did anymore and I've spent the rest of the night feeling like shit. I feel like such a nuisance, and that my existence is a bother to everyone, including myself. I wish there was a way to disappear, and not have anyone remember I ever was there.

"I went to a club with pretty good DJs last night. I went there last year as well and enjoyed it. Last night though at first I was fine and everything was cool but it got to just after midnight and I got this overwhelming feeling that I should leave.

I have been feeling low for the past couple days and just felt really anxious and upset on the day of NYE. My mood had slightly picked up before we went out but once we were there I just couldn't escape what I was feeling. My girlfriend was naturally really upset and couldn't understand why I wanted to leave. After having a bit of a row I just yelled ""It's because I'm fucking depressed!"" and left by myself. 

I have feelings of guilt - obviously I know she wanted me there but I let this mood I'm having control what I do. It must have looked strange to everyone and I feel like I wasted the night and an opportunity to have fun. Having said that the feeling I had making me want to leave was so overwhelming I wouldn't have enjoyed myself at all.

This scares me - this hasn't happened before, I am usually a sociable person and enjoy having fun with my friends. For the past couple of weeks though I've had this feeling that I just want to stay in bed and do nothing - finally last night I acted on it.

Is this depression? I really can't tell if I am or not and it worries me that this behaviour might be the start of it.",5
"I have an essay that is due tomorrow and I haven't really started and I'm afraid I will lose power because I live in New England where the huge fuckin snowstorm is and I know my teacher will not take that as an excuse because he's a fucking asshole. I guess this is more anxiety related, but it works.",2
"I suspect that what I'm dealing with is a mixture of anxiety and depression, but I haven't been to talk to anyone yet. I'm a college student and plan to see one of the psychologists on-campus after they reopen for spring semester. Anyway, I've been dealing with a lot of issues of feeling alone, sad, and generally hating myself. Not all the time...but enough for it to be an issue. I only talk to my boyfriend because he's the only one I trust. I have one friend but we aren't close enough to discuss ""real"" issues. My anxiety stems from having a chronic illness and being sexually abused in a past relationship, on top of a lot of general social anxiety. A lot of my ""depression"" (I say that in quotes because I'm not sure if that's what it is yet) is self-defeating. I frequently find my mind telling me that I'm worthless, even though I logically know it isn't true. There have even been times when I'm home alone and force myself to go somewhere because 1)I'm too miserable in my own head and 2)I'm afraid I'll succomb to hurting (NOT killing) myself if I'm alone with my own thoughts. I've just been struggling a lot lately and wondered if anyone has similar experiences and has gotten through it. I am going to see someone, and I'm contemplating Zoloft. Not as a real fix, but just something to help me dig out of this hole I'm in right now. Sorry this was so long, just a lot of thoughts to shuffle through! ",1
"As the title says some times I suddenly get sad for no reason. It comes out of the blue and lasts 1-2 days. Today's been one of those days were it just suddenly happens. I woke up this morning around 3am and out of nowhere I just start crying for no reason. I've been trying to hide my tears all day but it's clear as day that my eyes are red and puffy.I try my best to hide it from my partner because I fear what she might say or assume if I tell her that I cry for no reasons at times. Honestly I'm scared, the sudden onset of it keeps me off balance to the point where apparently I'm not even behaving the same. Wish this would just stop so I can go about my day without any fear of being found out.",0
"Not really hahaha ... i fucking hate myself... to be honest , i don't know why i became depressed. I always feel sad and lethargic. I always have no motivation. I am always so shy and very anxious. I can't even speak properly to anyone who are not close to me. Reporting in front of the class is always a nightmare, I always get very nervous and always forget the things i'm supposed to say. I also don't  know what I wanted to be. Choosing course on college made me cry for 2 years because of the fear of being on the wrong path. I'm not yet in college though but it feels like that i am already on the wrong track. I always don't know what to do because I don't like to do anything. Everything is boring... I want to kill myself but can't do it because I know that it's not the best way to face my problems... but what should i do? I feel like I am just forcing myself to be alive.",2
" I walked in on my first day of high school a depressed kid. i made some friends, they showed me that life is more than just moping around and working to get a diploma to mope and work more. They are the best people Ive met in my life so far and i would protect them with my life. i care for them a lot and would do anything for them.

That was 3 years ago, and of course, im still a depressed kid with friends. However, i think about killing myself on a weekly basis, and openly say that i hate myself to a lot of people. it has become common practice to say these things, like a shield to desensitize me and other people from mortality and the worse of the world. I also secretly hope that this softens the blow if i ever decide to jump off that overpass in my area. 

I want my friends, family, and everyone im connected with to remain happy and normal, so i put on that fake smile and pretend that nothing is wrong aside from the therapy that doesnt work. i value other people's happiness more than mine (for reasons that would make this post too long) so i keep on smiling and repress emotions until i walk into my room and shut the door. everyone i am connected with doesnt know im suicidal, i dont want them to worry about me, just to remain happy. and if i kill myself they would worry and get sad too, like me right now. i am living for other people because i dont want them to know the truth. i am a prisoner of other people. 

i just want to know what the hell am i supposed to do, and that im not alone in this world

tl,dr: i made friends in high school and started to care about people in my life. but im depressed and dont want anyone to know that im mentally ill and suicidal because i want them to stay happy and not worry about me. so i live with a false smile on my face, and keep my emotions to myself. what the heck am i supposed to do?",5
"Please list genre!

For me I have a few bands and songs that I enjoy putting on replay for hours.
(Alternative) ""Off With Their Heads"" is a band I found that relates. ""HOME"" is my favorite album for them.
(Metal) Bullet for my Valentine has 2 songs I really enjoy being ""Deliver us from evil"" and ""No way out"".
I also really enjoy (Metal) ""Counterparts"" for their angsty hard metal music.
Another favorite of mine since I was young is (Alternative) Senses Fail. I especially recommend their new album ""Pull the thorns from your heart"".
Finally, because this is probably rather long, I really enjoy (Alternative) bands Brand New and La Dispute. They talk about themes that relate to depression as well and are quite different from most bands I know.

"started 2018 w feeling low. im not medically diagnosed w it,depression. but, since it's been going on for 7 years. i have a hunch, it is, that serious. â (Î just the tip of the iceberg..)",3
"I've been depressed for about 7 years now starting when I was 13. I have wanted to kms since then, but never did it because I couldn't bear hurting people who care about me, even though at that point I didn't have many deep connections (cop out?), Now I'm 20, am needed to help my partner's mom make rent, working an internship that was specially made for me, and have been in a relationship for 2.5 years who ""didn't sign up"" for me being depressed but at least knows that I am in a dark place. I want so badly to kill myself. I am so depressed. I feel empty and hopeless and now I can't kill myself because people are actually relying on me now. 

I'm kind of just babbling but this is the only place I feel safe to be honest because I don't want people to treat me like a ticking time bomb. 

Last night (NYE) I got too drunk at a work party and made an ass of myself. I feel like a different person takes over sometimes and makes me feel suicidal and just generally puts me in bad situations in which I make messes upon messes. I look at myself in the mirror and don't even recognize the reflection as my own. I have to consciously fight to remember that I'm real. I get in my head a lot about how everything is subjective and nothing is real and it makes me feel so overwhelmed I could just drop dead.

I feel like I live in a sarcophagus; my face and body is the fancy lid, but inside there's this entire other existence trapped and unable to control anything that happens on the outside. 

I spend so much energy just keeping myself from killing myself that I don't have enough juice to have any sort of discipline. Then when I act without discipline, I feel so guilty and ashamed and it makes me want to kill myself more. 

I've tried to talk to therapists and all of that but no one seems to get it. They just nod their head and tell me it will get better. It hasn't. And it probably won't. I think I am just destined to be sad and eventually kill myself. My depression is so enmeshed in my identity (remember it's been around for most of my emotional development) that I don't even know anything about myself outside of it. It's strange to me that most people to whom I speak about it aren't depressed. It's so normal to me that I am actually shocked by people who don't live in constant despair and darkness. Hmm. Anyway.",4

I have been employed in government service for 20 years and still struggle financially. Nothing in life makes me happy right now. Not even my kids whom I love dearly!!

"I used to love this job. And if I think logically, I should have lots to be grateful for with it. 

But sitting here feels like I'm having my teeth pulled out. Every second I think when will be the moment I quit? When will be the breaking point?

I imagine going to my boss and telling him, but then I realize how ridiculous I would seem. 

I'm 24 and I can't just quit a good job because it feels horrible. How do people work with depression?",2
"My boyfriend told me he had been diagnosed with depression when he was 15, now he's 30. He takes medication prescribed 5 or more years ago without any medical control. A year ago he had been working with therapist for several months and since than nothing has changed (both in his and mine opinions).

From the one hand, he doesn't want to work, his parents give him money (despite it's hard for them, they both work). He is a journalist, so he can write articles but he doesn't want to. From the other hand, the only thing he cares about is ""social revolution"". He has even moved to another city to be closer to his friends in a radical organization. He participate in demonstrations and so on, but he still cannot wash the dishes after dinner. Anytime I ask him why he does nothing but ""revolution"" he tells me that he has been depressed for 15 years. In the same time he has no depression-related pain, he enjoys food and sex, he sleeps well even without taking his magic pills.

I'm an activist too, but I have two jobs, study languages and do at least something. I had two derpessions in my life, I took medication and I still visit my therapist several times a month. I know what depression is, but if I have depression and realize it than I go to psychiatrist or therapist and do whatever they prescribe. Why doesn't he even visit a doctor, if he tells he's sick?

To my mind, he is trying to get rid of any responsibility in his life, so he has ""depression"". We've been together for 2 years, I love him, everything is ok when I don't ask him about doing something. As soon as I do, ""depression"" comes. 

I don't know what to do. I want to stay with him, but not with his ""depression"". I see my father living in a kind of similar condition, and I don't want to be his sponsor or feel guilt for ""not being empathic enough"", doing whatever he needs, as my mother does.

What am I supposed to do?",2

I hate the thought of not being able to do the job. I hate how much more of my time it takes up despite only being contracted for two more hours than I was at my previous job.  
  
I understand that there comes nerves with a new start but I'm starting to wonder if it's all worth the effort if I was so much happier in my previous job, not just doing the work but it didn't invade my life with thoughts when I wasn't there. I have suffered from depression before, though not connected to work, and I can feel that the longer I am at my new job the less I'm enjoying my life. I've been absolutely miserable and unwanting to do anything in the past week. I don't know what to do. Any kind words would be greatly appreciated.",2
"It started around 3 years ago. When strange things happen just to make my life worse. Even if it affects others. 

My relationship with my family isn't that great. We never do anything, my dad is just lazy and for the most part only wants to watch tv or YouTube. My mom has a neurological disorder that makes her sleep a lot. But now I believe that she's just being lazy as she has gotten better. I believe that if she change her sleeping routines and go to bed and get up at the same time every day she won't sleep as much. Then she can seek a new job and start working again. She worked as a teacher before. It's quite stressful so that could've been the reason her disorder worsened.

When it comes to friends I really does only have two. But one of them is a bit shy and for the most part only wants to play computer games. And the other one doesn't have so much time to hang out with friends. Anyway one strange phenomena was about 2 weeks ago when we had the opportunity to choose who we would want to learn a ""Just dance"" dance with. We could choose to be 2-4 people per group. I didn't really get into any group so then I asked my closest mates if I could be with them but they were already 4. So they said that i could go to the group with 3 people. But I didn't, it did not feel right. So next lesson we wrote down who were in which group. And we started arguing in which group I would be in. But the group with three refused to let me be with them for no reason. It's strange because I used to hang out a lot with two of them before. Many of my class mates was on my side and started to get angry and upset that they refused to have me in their group. But they had already decided, it was impossible to change their mind. Soon a mate that I've known for a long time who has always been supportive let me in his group. And now we were five in one group. The strangest thing of all is that the two mates who were in the group with three. We are still going home together as usual, joking around and just having fun.

Now in Christmas time my cousins have been here celebrating Christmas together. First my younger cousins were here and just as they were leaving my older cousins came. At first everything is great and all but then my cousin who is two years younger than me is starting to get annoying as he always do and questions everything you do that he think is strange. And when you try to argue with him about it he's too stubborn. So you cannot prove him wrong. But what is most annoying is when he always does as you don't want. He's 13 years old but behaves like a three year old who always do the opposite as you want. And the worst thing is that I can't just leave him. If he comes to visit me he will stay for a long time. 

At New Year's eve. We were left at home with our grandpa while my younger cousin who's 11, my and their parents went to a NYE feast at my parents friends house. Me and my cousin needed to cook food for the evening so we did. Afterward we went to the city to watch a firework show. When we went home again we saw that my younger cousin was at home so we asked what she did home and she answered that their mom got drunk and dizzy. It was unbelievable because she never drink so much alcohol. Later at the night my younger cousin wanted to watch Netflix on her brothers iPad but he didn't allow her as usual and they started fighting I don't know what's wrong with him but he has some kind of disease. The fight went down intensively until my grandpa shouted at them to be quiet. Their dad hadn't got home yet so they called him and said that he needed to get home  instantly. We waited about an hour but he didn't come. We called again, he explained that it was hard to get a taxi at that time. But just as we hung up their mom came down and was insanely angry she almost threw our iPads on the floor. We instantly ran upstairs to go to bed. The next day my younger cousin was upset about what happened last night and screamed that she was an idiot. She didn't get angry and realized her mistakes to drink so much. 

I don't know what to do anymore everything just seem so meaningless. It feels like I won't experience a great life because of all the bad things that happen to me. I hope that you can find  solutions for my problems.

I'm sorry if I didn't use the correct grammar. English is my second language and I'm writing this on my iPad.

Thank you for your time, I really appreciate it!

"And I am entering a pretty nasty hole.  I am only 17, i have enough hope to keep going. But this year is KEY in my life, because, if i do bad, i will end up WORSE. I could lose everything. 

I am going to try mushrooms in summer, in my birthday. Probably in the beach with an experienced friend. 
 If the year goes good(that means change in myself), the setting will be amazing, and i will enjoy the trip.
 If the year turns south, i will probably have a terrible trip, but the shrooms will teach me something. Maybe then, i can change.

Sorry for the bad english, i don't have anyone else to talk. This week has been very hard. I've hated myself more than ever and even taking my medications has failed to dispel the emotional pain I feel. I spent the whole year struggling with my depression and even hiding so that my boyfriend doesn't have to worry about it more, and why, so that he decides to cheat and justified by the stress, and the needy that I tend to be. God, I do not know how to explain the pain I feel, her mother speaking bad about me, threatening to talk to my family because she thinks i'm not good enough for her son, blaming me for her son's problems. I can't anymore, I have no one to talk to, I'm getting tired of all this shit, they don't know, his family doesn't know Who i am, i just can't anymore, all this shit in just one week.

I grew up well normally i guess but as i git older and into middle school i started noticing wierd things like when i would argue with my brother he would call me retarded and small little things like people looking at me wierd,etc.


when i went to alternative school for getting into trouble i was in a whole other section with other slightly off kids(there was a other section for people with much worse and noticeable illnesses? I guess)


And now im a freshman more and more little things now that 2nd semester started i got put into special weight lifting (yes its for special people) but everyone in there looks normal like me and i have a freind in there aswell from that alternative school.


My mental state is a piece of shit to say the least i cant concentrate for more than a minute i cant hold any conversations partly cause im socially awkward and have anxiety this has made me deppresed and suicidal while a completely shut down from the world.

I do smoke weed twice every month or so and have tooken others to cope, i drink alot and heavily when i do, and smoke tobacco on the regular. Do these contribute ot relate in any way to my mental state?

I need some help guys i hope this doesnt get buried imam afraid i might do something bad to myself or others as i go from deppressed to happy often but ive been mostly deporesed and down.

"There's something that's been on my chest lately, well, it's been there for a long time, I just didn't know. 

I've been depressed. I'm not diagnosed, I'm too scared the doctors will tell me what I already know. Im scared that I'll have to explain to my parents that their happy, always goes-with-the-flow son is depressed. I'm scared that my dad, who's born in raised in the back woods of Texas, will say it's not a real condition. I'm scared that my mother will blame herself for not spending more time with me, or that she could have raised me better. I'm scared that my siblings won't be comfortable with the fact that their brother is ill. I'm scared that my friends will abandon me when they realize I'm not the stable person I pretend to be. I'm scared that others would find out and wouldn't want to talk to the depressed kid. I'm scared that my thoughts will get the better of me one of these days. I'm scared that it won't get better. 

I've just finished my first semester of college. My lack of will and drive has caused my GPA to straddle the line of academic probation which would lead to me eventually getting kicked out of my dream school. I've come to realize just how bad my mental state has been for years now. I was able to move away from home and allowed to really look back on my life and in doing that, I realized something. I couldn't remember the last time I was happy, or the last time I woke up in the morning and wanted to get up, or the last time killing myself wasn't on my mind. I never had many friends so I've withheld telling them these things when we talk. In fact, no one know about how I really am inside. Sure I'll sit there, around other people cracking jokes smiling and laughing, but deep down I'm not the one really there. That's just one of my many mask I use to hide behind. The real me shakes uncontrollably while interacting with other people. I want to scream and run away if I'm ever around people for too long. I tell my roommates to go out without me because I can't afford it, when really it's so I can let my feelings out and sob without worrying about them being around. I don't even know why I cry. I just kind of do. I can be sitting in the middle of a conversation and suddenly get this feeling like I'm getting sucked inside a deep void inside of myself and all I want to do is bawl. But I can't. That would raise questions and those questions would lead to the real me under my hollow shell. And that really scares me. I don't even know who âIâ am anymore. My personality changes with every person I know. I try to avoid it. I'll binge watch a show on Netflix, I'll get lost in the story of a game, I'll connect with these wacky personalities in anime. But lately, I've lost interest. Those shows and games don't work like they used to. Now I just stare at a paused screen for hours because I've just detached myself from reality. 

It's New Years. But I'm the same me. New and exciting treads are sure to come and go but I will remain the same. It's unlikely that I'll see next year, but maybe I'll drag through these 365 days just to see what happens. Who knows. 

I don't blame you if you don't read this. There's no structure, and it's more or less just getting all of my thoughts out that I've kept in for so painfully long. But if you did read it, thank you? Honestly I just want this to be buried. I just felt I had to say these things before I lost my mind. Being a full time actor is exhausting lol.

But here's the thing. He's the one who found the course and told me to go and do it. I was so ready for the job and I feel so frustrated that I did the course for basically no good reason. It really felt like my golden ticket for a better life and now I can't find a job anywhere.",2

Or maybe I want people to know who I am. Maybe I'm just so hurt right now that I'll do anything just to be seen. Just to be spoken to. I am so very alone, and unwanted.

I am a broken man, and these are the attempts I made to become better for the woman I love, the woman I am no longer with.

Between the last part and this one, my therapist and I established a history of medications and treatment, and whatnot. When we got back into the real issues, it went as follows;

&gt; Hello /////-

&gt; Thanks for sharing information related to your medical and mental health history. It is evident that you are being intentional about being open about your history , symptoms and experiences. Please remember that being open and willing to work through things that are blocking your current progress and ""fueling"" ongoing mood symptoms and making interpersonal functioning difficult is KEY to reducing your symptoms and rebuilding your life. It is important to get this information so that together we can get a clearer understanding of your past and current history. This will be very useful when we meet on Thursday as we review the therapeutic process and begin to start setting goals.

&gt; /////- I am sorry to hear that you experienced years of sexual abuse . You are definitely a survivor and a man of courage. In our society the trauma that men experience is sometimes swept under the rug, without any acknowledgement. You won't find that here. ALL of who you are and what you have experienced is welcome in this space and vital to your healing . Self knowledge and awareness is the basis of all knowledge . I am glad you took a chance by sharing something so personal. I can't imagine trying to deal with all of the thoughts, emotions and isolation this has brought into your life .

&gt; You know, I can't help but wonder how this trauma impacted your view of yourself, others , the world and your place in it. Have you ever talked about this part of your life experiences with anyone else ? Does your family or partner have any clue about all that you have been through ? You mentioned having siblings . Please tell me more about your relationship with them .

&gt; This is YOUR time for healing and renewal . No need to thank me for my time. You reached out for help and with a desire to learn how to grow into a better version of yourself and you are worth it!! Continue to believe in yourself by remaining open , speak your truth !! The possibilities are endless!


*If you need any other information regarding those things, let me know.*

*As for how this has affected my views, well. Most of them are not good, except when they are. At my best, I would consider myself an optimistic nihilist. At my worst, I wouldn't know. My view on myself is that I am pointless, worthless, a failure, important to no one in any meaningful way, and completely incapable of doing anything I would enjoy in life, much less anything productive or helpful to others. Except for the times it isn't, where I can acknowledge and even enjoy my strong suits. People actively seek to befriend me and I have had strong relationships.*
*I am aware that I have value to myself and others, and even sometimes enjoy what few things I've done for myself. I've seen some interesting things, been to some interesting places. My opinions and views on literally everything shift from moment to moment, or mood to mood. Life and the world we live in is equaled in beauty only by it's brutality. Fair in its unfairness, harmonious in its discord. In life, one man may experience heaven and for it another man will experience hell. In the end, we are all the same life, being lived out through different circumstances.*

*How I feel largely dictates how I see everything in that particular moment. Sometimes it's balanced and calm, many times it is bitter and indignant. My place in this life it is mine to chose, but there is nothing I have considered that has moved me to the point of choosing to do it. Nothing about myself matters enough that I would ever do anything to better my situation or make my own life one that I would be proud to have lived. Even this may be an attempt to better myself, but it is not FOR myself. I'm doing it because I want to make someone else happier without losing them, to be better FOR THEM, not for me. I do not care about myself.*

*I have only rarely mentioned these things to people. My family knows, but, that's about it. I have told the current woman I am in a relationship with of some of my history, including the abuse, but certainly not most of it. Certainly not the experiences with drugs or some of the worse things I've seen, and done.*

*The relationship with my siblings is strained, at best. I have no idea where to even begin. I grew up with two brothers. One older by a year, one younger by a year. Our path from childhood to adulthood was spent making attempts to murder or inflict serious injury on each other, interspersed with brief moments of kinship. I can honestly say that I have very few, almost zero, good memories of either of them to this day, None of us had doors to our rooms because we kept destroying them, breaking them down each time one of us would start a fight and then run away.*

*There was an occasion I recall where an uncle of ours entered onto an altercation where I had a knife to the throat of my younger brother because he had antagonized me to the point of nearly killing him, meanwhile he laughed uncontrollably having been pleased with himself for doing so. He had once put rusty nails and screws into eggfoam outside my room and caused me to have over fifteen holes in my left foot when I stepped on it not thinking there would be anything in it. The older brother had a bunch of douchebag friends who themselves were basically bullies and awful to be around, and he himself was extremely violent. He was a Juggalo for a good portion of his teen years, if that explains anything.*

*I spent most of my life just trying to avoid the two of them. Hard to do without doors sometimes. I can list our literally hundreds of instances where we were all shitty human beings to each other and those around us. As of typing this, the two of them have had a fight where my younger was knocked unconscious, and beaten, sustaining a possible permanent injury to one of his ankles. I do not know if they'll ever speak again. And I've told both that I don't want to be a part of their shit.*

*When we were older, things got better. But all three of us have always been belligerant about whats been done in the past, and none of us really get along well for long periods of time. A few hours is usually my threshold before I need to be away from them. They can occasionally be good company, but, mostly not.*

*I think that's enough text for this one. I will say, I do not have faith in myself. I do not believe in myself. If I did, I would have done a lot more than I have. I wouldn't be failing every time I make an attempt to find some kind of happiness.*",1
"Since my middle school I've developed a ,,mask'' to hide my feelings. When I go out to school or with my friends I ,,put it on'' and pretend to be ok. Even in home I wear it to hide myself from my parents and sister. Only at night (00:00 or 1am) I put it off. Then I cry and memories about hate return. I hate myself. Everything I do. I don't know what to do because I don't know who I am now.

"Why can't I accept reality and just come to terms with the fact the girl I want doesn't want me. Even starting to think she's playing with me. From the random texts she sends with hearts, to the pics she'll send, the calls, the time she told me she would've been with me if she knew I liked her all those years ago. Maybe it was when she told me she'll be with me eventually or that she called me her future man.. Or maybe the most likely thing is I'm to easily hung up on a girl I'll never actually be with.

Should I take responsibility for my own mental caught ups cuz it feels wrong to just say it was her. But come on how can a girl like that, as beautiful as a painting of roses would be with me.. She loves him.. She loves her boyfriend of 2 years and there's nothing I can do about that. She loves a man who abuses her in every way possible. And while I'm wondering if his physical abuse is worse than his mental and verbal abuse, you're in love with him and refuse to leave him. So why fill my head with a false reality as if we'll run away together. Why does it hurt so much when you jokingly told me to chill out with wanting to be with you. I just can't understand why you choose to be abused rather than be with me.

I can't get you out my head but why would I want to. My reason for smiling is my reason for depression lately. I want to quit you like a smoking habit but every time I get a little message with a heart at the end from you I can't help myself. I've known you for so long and yet I couldn't see this coming at all. I know I'm a fool, I know I shouldn't get so mad that you love your abuser, I know I should just move on but I just can't. You are what I want and I know in my mind I probably won't ever have you, and that I'm getting going played like a goddamn violin either for your fun or worse.. But it hurts and I know it hurts so much because I'm a fool who can't get what he wants",4
"I'm so fed up of this illness ruining my life. It's been there the whole time, it's been affecting my ability to progress, but because I'm intelligent and I have good days where I can do really well, I was denied any acknowledgement that I am unwell by doctors for years, until last month, during a really low dip, a crisis day, when a doctor admitted that I am not well and gave me medication for it. I was told I couldn't continue at college because of the effects it had on me, the time off I had to take, the low self worth. I've had so many days off sprinkled throughout my time at work. I've had to take one today because I was just completely paralysed with physical fear this morning, at nothing at all, and all day I've been panicking at tiny everyday things, like getting a letter, needing to use the bathroom, needing to clean up from making food. I'm so scared that I'm going to lose my job. I don't think people believe how debilitating this is for me on these days, they think I'm being lazy or weak, that maybe I'm just not coping with a normal bad day that everyone has and chickening out or using it as an excuse, because a lot of the time I'm either able to present myself as capable and functioning, or I'm actually feeling great and normal and a whole world away from this shit. I just am not physically capable today of very simple things. 
I don't have the energy to talk through all of the shit I've dealt with and all the things I've felt and to tell all of this to whichever medical professional for them to then dismiss it all and tell me there's nothing there and they won't help me. It's too much and I don't know how to organise it all or prioritise what to say. So I got to the point of just not telling them much at all, whenever friends or family who cared about me told me I must go to see a doctor, and then obviously that all goes on record saying I'm pretty much fine every time. 
I'm just scared that when I feel better in a few days, I'll have ruined it all for real me. When the fog lifts and I do give a shit about life again and feel normal it's fucked up. ",5
"I'm 14 and I just lost my virginity, I felt unbelievable. I was so happy. Morning came along when me and her had sobered up. She says she doesn't regret it but now I feel awful and my paranoia is telling me that she hates me and she hates what we did. All I want to do is run a bath and have a nap with my head under the water.",4
"It's terrible feeling. I want to cry, just let it out, but I can't. It feels like my soul is crying, but i just physically can't get it out. It's like I'm stuck with this pain forever and am not allowed to at least alleviate it in a way. I... just can't explain it... I just hope someone understands...",5
How much trouble would I be in if I pointed a squirt gun that looked like a real gun at a cop? Assuming that I was shot at but still survived would I get in trouble by the law if they knew that my intentions were suicide and that I had no real weapon?,5
I feel so neglected and abandoned by everyone. I wish others would care about me as much as I care about them. I AM SO FUCKING SAD AND LONELY. I'm better off dead.,4
"I get told that quite a lot when I mention having a rather difficult life with out going into detail. When I do go into detail though, I always get told that I have had an extremely hard life, so I guess my question is, while on the front I know what they mean by ""everyone has had a hard life"" but is that just a way to shut down a conversation?",5
"I don't remember not having this and it's not going to go away.
 Even my boyfriend thinks I'm toxic and I can't count the amount of times I've hurt him, my family, the people I care about over the last year. I've given up on anything getting better. I have a way to stop hurting now.",4
"A few months ago I was hired by a very well-known business. I had to leave my other job abruptly because this new job was paying my $15 an hour which is damn near double the amount I was making at my old job. 

I wanted to give my old job a two-weeks notice but I couldn't because the new job couldn't give me a proper state date then they finally told me it would be the following Monday which was three days later. It sucked but I had to tell my boss that I had to quit after the Saturday before. He knew that I was getting a new job so I didn't just spring this on him. I hated telling him I had to start on Monday.

Monday rolls around and the new job tells me they don't need me until a week later. I didn't have my old job to go back to since they had already taken me out of the system. So yay, I was screwed out of a weeks pay. 

I finally did get to work the following week. Now, I don't have a car of my own. New job said they would work with me and either pick me up from my home or have me walk a few blocks to be picked up. Since November I have only worked a total of two weeks. I don't have a car to just drive around and look for jobs nor do I have a friend that can drive me around (I don't even know what a friend is anymore). 

New job hasn't had any work for me for the past two weeks and they are saying they are keeping us till the 13th. I have a phone bill I have to pay in a few weeks plus give my roommate rent. He also works for new job and is also having a hard time as well since he has no car.

I simply do not have the money to buy a car or even a down payment. I wish I knew what to do or where to go. I can't help but once again think about the life I had before last June. I had a family, a car and a wife. I still have a bit of resentment towards her because when she left me she want to her parents and they immediately helped her get a car. We lost our old car because we were behind on payments and I was borrowing a car from a friend of her family until she left then they guy suddenly needed it back...

I'm just super worried about everything. I don't have a single way out of this house. I feel like this is my prison. I'm here with roommates who all they want to do is get high (I have no problems with smoking by the way) and play video games. I enjoy gaming myself, but I don't want that to just be my life. I hate it here. I wish I knew of something to do or where to go. I wish a someone would talk to me or listen. I wish someone was concerned about my life. I miss having friends who cared. I just...I hate this. I hate all of it.",2
"My wife completely dismisses my depression and also tries to tell me its just an excuse. If I am having an off/bad day she says I am just being an asshole and am trying to ruin her day and sometimes she even goes as far to say that I am ruining her life. I have times when I am down that I cannot be as attentive or give her 100% of my attention, but if I try to say I am just having an off day she says I am just trying to find an excuse for my behavior and not taking ownership of it. There have been days where she says she wants me to get out or leave and I have wanted to, so that I can get away from the pain, but I never do and I end up staying and hoping to just work things out or that maybe I deserve how she treats me. The only thing I feel is really keeping me there with her are out kids, who are the light of my life. I am just not sure what to do and what is going on with me, maybe there is someone else who has been through something similar and can offer words of advise.",4
"I'm only 18, but I already feel like my glory days have come and gone. Back I highschool, I was pretty much the ""King of The Nerds"", as it were. I was one of the only upper classmen who was really into stuff like anime and video games, so all the younger nerds sort of looked up to me? I guess? I was the drum major in my schools band, and I had all this other stuff going on. My senior year of highschool was the year I grabbed life by the balls and made it my bitch. But now look at me, I can't even muster the energy to get out of bed. I can't hold a job, I can't drive, my girlfriend left me, etc. I'm not half the person I was just a year ago. I feel like an old man past his prime, just sort of struggling and failing to keep up with the kids these days. I'm certainly out of touch at least. I don't have a clue what's going on in the nerd circles these days, let alone what's happening in the real world. I really just want to give up on life and call it quits, since I can't see myself getting out of this hole anytime soon, and when I do, I'll be so far behind everyone else that it'll just be pathetic. I'll be an old man stuck where all the kids are, and everyone will be outpacing me.",2
"I hate myself, i hate everything I am.  I wish I didn't.  Or maybe I really don't.  Maybe I just can't take the negative thoughts, the pain, the apathy, the endless battle you can never win anymore.  I feel like I'm worthless, like I mean nothing to anyone.  I'm always trying to live up to impossible expectations from a person that doesn't exist.  I hurt, and hurt, and hurt and hurt so much that my heart may as well explode and nothing changes.  I go to bed, I wake up the next day and repeat that for however long I get to till I'm back here.  Knowing that there will never be a point where I don't come back here till the day I die.  

Why don't I get to be normal?  Why don't I get to be happy without the looming sadness and anger?  What did I do to deserve this?  Is it because I exist?  Not letting me live wasn't enough punishment.  I had to be cursed to live a life where I wake up everyday hating myself more and more and more till the white noise becomes a ringing that becomes banging in my head screaming ""YOU ARE WORTHLESS"" in a mask of my own voice.  I just want to be free of this curse.",1

"I tell myself this every year. But I am fed up with living every day. I don't want to get out of bed, I just want to die. I hate my home I hate my family and I hate my life. I have tried to kill myself ever since I was 5, I was not meant to be in this world. I am very sick as well, and hate being sick. I had a fun New Years up until I got home. It's 3:02 and I'm disappointed with myself again. I've been to therapy and a psychiatrist but nothing works. I have a job already but I lack the skills to talk to others, I try and have improved a lot but other times I always feel like they're talking bad about me. I work hard but I never think it's hard enough. I think I'll have to get three jobs soon due to starting college and I honestly don't want to be 30 or 40 still having to pay student loans. I think I am going to kill myself this year. I made a post on here similar to this but ended up not doing it because I couldn't leave my friend alone. But now we barley talk.",5
"I lost contact with one of the only people I've ever cared about in 2015. Though we only knew each other through the internet, it was the deepest friendship I've ever had. Knowing that it's now yet another year in the past is tearing me apart... The worst part is knowing that we were separated by shitty circumstances and not by choice. What if she's out there thinking the same thing?

Does this feeling ever go away on its own?",4
"It seems petty that I have to post on a forum to announce my own suicide, and not to mention that if I really wanted to die, I wouldn't be attention-whoring myself, but I would at least want to say goodbye to this world that I've lived in as a respectable leave-off, almost like a resignation letter in a job, even if it was just a single post on the internet. Please consider that I have no one to say goodbye to, I have no family, I have no religion, and I have no friends, the internet is all I have. I am looking forward to finally have everything lifted off my shoulders. In approximately 4 hours, I will be leaving, so I say goodbye not to this subreddit, but to all the people that I will be sending this reddit post link to, and generally everyone reading.     Gabe",5
"I'm having a bad month - make that six, no, a dozen, make that 2 years, wait, 6 years....


I've been trying to become ""normal"" for six. fucking. years. I've tried so many times to ""reset"" myself, but I haven't found a solution that lasts more than 2 weeks. I hate to log into this account. Sometimes I look into my post history to track how many days it's been since I was last broken, always to find that it's always less than 2 weeks.


Why am I even trying? I don't know... I get up. I fall back down. Get up, fall down. Get up, fall down. My sometimes-optimistic self congratulates me for always getting up after every fall. But the depressed, brooding me scoffs.. It's like the depressed me knows this cycle is never going to end... The change that my sometimes-optimistic self hopes will happen, nah, not gonna happen. Ever.

Am I always going to fall down every single time I try? I don't know, and I doubt you do either.

"Turns out no self-esteem for years really ruins your life. Due to this I developed major and chronic depression. Know exactly what I need to do, can't do it.

You don't just rebuild self-esteem over days, weeks, months, or even years. This takes decades. 

Decades of kindness, decades of acceptance, decades of love. It's real hard to get that as someone who feels like every breath is robbing another of oxygen.

Pretty sure it's game over for my mental health. Oh well. Maybe I can learn to live without these things but 4+ years of trying make me weary, y'know.

Anyways my life sucks, your life might suck, but supposedly life in general doesn't suck. Hard to believe I know.",1

I know we shouldn't compare ourselves to others, but why is it soooo difficult to stop? I try to block them from my mind, but always end up drifting back. Whenever I see these  people,  I just get this awful sick feeling in my stomach.

I still talk to him from time to time, but we're not the ""talk everyday"" type of friends.

I was bored on Reddit recently so I decided to check his profile because he posts his own music and some stupid (in a good way) jokes sometimes, and I wanted to check it out.

I found his post here from a few weeks ago and I realized he broke up with his girlfriend, flunked a few classes, feels like he doesn't have anyone to talk to, and is really depressed h.

He didn't show up to a party we threw some time ago but we assumed that it was because of his grades. Now we found out he's going through issues.

We resolved to invite him to more stuff and reach out to him. We're also putting together a ""grades rehab crew"" to help tutor him next semester. What else can we do to help him through this?

For example, is it wise to ask people we know in his college block about the situation?

Do we tell him we saw his post?

I really wanna help my friend out. We would really appreciate your advice, reddit.

Here's his post for some more info.

"Does anyone actually ever beat depression? I'm not being negative, but really? Long term normality? Anyone done it?

It's been about 24 months so I've had a good run! But hey! Welcome back my energy draining, Lack of sleeping, Suicidal thoughts, and over powering anxiety! It's been a while, but your back. 

I've had a history, not going into it, but I used to have psychotic depression at 21, with a very above average drinking habit. 

I have been alright though. I got a decent job, built up a solid network of good friends, I do nice things, but recency I've just been falling behind. 

I don't sleep anymore,  keep having overpower bouts of anxiety, horrible flash backs, and if I'm being honest, recently I've been walking a different route home out of fear ill through myself off the bridge near my house.

"I've just really been struggling the past few years in my home town where I still live. I'm lucky to be able to still live at home with my mom and brother who care about me while I work full time and have pretty cheap rent living at home while I pay debts off. But other than that, I don't have much else here. I have no friends and a lot of people who know me or of me really don't like me, which is a mixture of things I've done to push people away but also things that I have no control over. I do have a good career path I'm happy to be in, merchandising for one of the 3 major pop companies and the opportunity to move up and even transfer. Since I don't really have anything where I'm at right now other than my job which I can transfer with, should I just bite the bullet and move away when I can afford it after my debts are paid? I'm just really scared that things won't be much better for me especially since I'm pretty Introverted and don't do things like go out to bars like most people do my age(22) since that's just not the scene I'd like to socialize in.

"I have nobody to talk to. I find it hard to open to talk to people about things. Sometimes if someone asks me something, I can just see in their face that they are losing interest. People really don't give a shit what I have to say about anything. I can't talk to my family about anything because I haven't live near them for years and they don't hardly know anything about what is really going on in my life. Especially not with my depression. 

My SO has been pulling away from me and left me all alone last night because she didn't want to sit home with me and had already made plans with someone without me and didn't even mention anything until she was leaving. I sat home alone and drank myself sick until 3:45 when she finally came home. She didn't even say a word to me. Whenever I try to talk about things, it just ends up back in a circle and we have been in a weird rut for a long time. I have never felt so alone in my life and maybe not as low as this in a long time. I just needed to vent things. I am not looking forward to another year of shit like 2017.

"Sometimes I feel bad because my depression is not as bad as some people who commit suicide or live in constant agony. Even posting this was hard because I thought people with ""real"" depression should be helped first. 

I have been in and out of depression for the last 10 years. Mostly bouncing between deep apathy where I didn't care about anything and extreme joy and euphoria in  3 month cycles. It all ended about a year ago when instead of apathy and numbness I felt deep sorrow, sadness and grief and got stuck there. No more numbness or euphoria just always feeling sad and wanting to cry but not being able to. Also feeling like there is no hope in regards to any aspect of my life. I almost never leave home in the last 2-3 month except to get food and run errands, luckily I work from home and I really avoid all human contact except my girlfriend. I even stopped responding to calls/texts from friends because I feel like no one really understands what I'm going through and everyone just wants to say ""ohh toughen up, life's hard, get your shit together, stop feeling mopy"".  My work is suffering since I cant really concentrate on it and Im worried I might loose it. I feel deep shame and regret because I achieved nothing in the last 10 years of my life (my 20s) nor did I have any fun most of my peers had. 

I feel like I cant go on like this because its a horrible place to be stuck in and I want to seek help but I am confused where to start. 

Should I looks for a psychologist or psychiatrist ? I dont have suicidal thoughts I'm just really scared I will live like this for the rest of my life. Is my condition psychological or physiological ? Is there a test to take ? I'm really against anti depressants due to the scary side effects but I'm opening up to the idea slowly if I know 100% that that's he only way for me to get better. 

Are there any resources I should check out ? I really dont know where to start. I appreciate any help I can get.

"Here we are again, in the middle of the night with nothing but the thoughts of failure, loneliness and fear of the future. I've been here so often over the last 10 years it feels like home. And has it really been 10 years? Unfortunately, yes. 10 years of depression. 10 years of anxiety issues interfering with my daily life. 5 Years out of high school and all I can count is the number of things I've fucked up. Dropped out of college. Been through 6 under-paid jobs that had me working 12 or more hours a day to exhaustion and panic attacks. That one really kills me. For the longest time panic attacks weren't something I had to worry about. I had maybe 3 from age 13 to 18. Then retail happened to me and I started having one a month. Then it turned into 1 a week. Then it turned into having problems leaving my house and jumping at the sound of a car starting. I suppose I've worked through part of that. I don't jump at everything anymore, and I managed to get out of the house some but being in public for any extended period of time still makes me nervous. I ran out of friends somewhere 2 years ago when I realized that my entire friend-group only hung around because I was a convenient source for weed and car rides. The last roomates I had were more my children than friends, since I had to constantly pick up after them to keep some organization in my living space, and constantly woke me up in the middle of the night bringing groups of drunk people over. I went straight after that. No drugs, no alcohol, no smoking. I still miss smoking. It gave me some amount of comfort in hard times, but you can't keep doing a thing that's killing you. Or so they say. I still have the urge to live, otherwise I would have kept the habit even when I started coughing up blood most mornings.
But the period of severe anxiety and depression before I did give up everything drained what meager savings I had accumulated. I was so afraid to leave the house that I quit my job, ordered delivery every day, and tried to drown my sorrows in alcohol and weed. There went 2k in a matter of months. What a waste. I could have bought into Bitcoin with that money. 
My mom had recently moved back into the state. I had no idea until she showed up on my doorstep every other day when my phone service went out. She helped me get out of the shit house I was staying in, gave me a place to stay and food for the last month, but I can tell her patience is running thin. In the beginning it was all ""OMG let me help you!"" ""We'll take you to a therapist"". That lasted all of a week before it was on to the same drivel I got growing up about getting a job. Meanwhile, I can't get even get McDonald's to call me back anymore. -.- I don't really think I need to talk to a therapist. Drugs aren't going to improve my situation all that much. Getting a call back from even the lowest of the pizza delivery places around here would help. A lack of inflation driving school tuitions and hence my student loans sky high would help. But drugs? I doubt it. If the drugs that helped me decide to STOP doing drugs didn't help, then the one's to dull my mind and make me ok with slaving for 12 hours a day on a wage that won't pay for an apartment without room-mates sure as hell aren't. But that comes too close to playing the victim for comfort. I don't want to be a victim, I don't want sympathy, I just want to do something productive that makes me not feel like shit, and lets me afford my own space. Does that sound like too much to ask? Really, someone should tell me because from my POV it doesn't, but I may not be thinking in the clearest terms anymore. My experiences of the last 5 years certainly seem to point in this direction. But whatever the case may be, thanks for reading, if you have. It's a release of some sort to put my thoughts down on paper.",5
"This is a throw away account.

I have never been in a relationship with someone and never had sex or sexual contact with anyone either. I know that isn't really a HORRIBLE thing at all. But I am starting to wonder why?

Story: The only guy I have attracted to a possible relationship has severe depression and general anxieties disorder. He is kind of a shut-in and plays videogames and does drugs when he is not working. That's the extent of his life that I am aware of. I have known him for a few years and at some points durng those years were very close and talked about getting into a serious relationship. At some points, he called me his girlfriend but we never have been REALLY at that point. He used to tell me that he cared about me a lot. He would go through depressive phases and disappear sometimes. When he came back it was always the same. ""I'm sorry, I'm not a good person, I'm bad at relationships, I want to die, etc"".

I still try to get through to him even now. He ignores me or tries to set up a hook-up date and then pretty much just blows me off anyway.

I'm starting to wonder less about him and more about me. My friends say that he is not capable of a relationship and it is not a reflection of my worth that he is not receprocating my feelings. But at the same time... if this is all I can get, is this a reflection of me? Am I depressed because I am alone... or am I alone because I am depressed?

Will getting into a relationship with someone make me feel any better? I used to think that I could help him by showering him with my affection and attention. I used to think that if he did this to me, I would feel better and everything would be solved.

For some reason, I think this is foolish now. Maybe it's just growing through the attachment and coming out from the other side in hindsight. Maybe it's just getting tired of him not liking me back. I don't know.

I feel like there is a connection between being alone and being depressed though. I feel like if I would have some thing or someone to support me, I would be more likely to overcome or be motivated to overcome other things. I know that's weak. I just get exhausted and lonely sometimes. Going through all my life without anyone has really been difficult but I'm not trying to whine about it, please don't think that.",4
"I have a sensitive topic to discuss with someone like a therapist. I'm looking for advice, but I left my last therapist because I didn't have time to see her anymore. Is there somewhere online I can go to talk to someone? I need someone I can be completely honest with and the online barrier kinda helps me with that. 

*Not suicidal, just looking for help*",4
i can go for a walk but i can't really walk around for 8 hours a day. what are some things i can do to get out of the house all day? ,0
"Maybe because all I feel like I am is a toy.
A useless one, at that. I wonder how he puts up with me.

Use and throw away. Stupid. Boring. Unattractive. Terrible in bed. All I'm good for is for getting other people off and not myself. For spoiling others, because I don't want the burden of possessions for when I finally off myself. I had a nice thought earlier. Sell off all my things. Work up a travel fund. Travel to a nice place to disappear and die, probably. Somewhere that hopefully nobody I know has to deal with it.

There's some things up in the air leaving me feeling uncertain, even though I was told they would help me. But I can't help but feel gross, or a burden for asking for financial assistance. I never wanted people to spend money on me. I can't wait until I can go back to living alone, where I don't have to eat. I am so sick of existing.

I don't even really have much of a sex drive anymore. My libido's gone straight through the floor. I still crave being touched, but at the same time I feel like it would instigate a fight if he tried. Love him to death, but I can't shake that feeling that he only stays because I'm a clingy piece of shit. ",5
"A little background on me. I'm a 17 (soon to be 18) year old dude. What I meant by ""she makes me feel"" is that before her, all my feelings were very mild, sometimes even nonexistant. Like I didn't really fear anything (except for a weird fear of spiders, but that's besides the point), but I also don't think I've felt love or genuine happiness before. And I was fine with that, I liked being logical and that worked.

But this summer I met a girl. For anonymity purposes, we'll call her L. Now, L is the sweetest, most caring person I have ever met. We started talking at my summer job and instantly we clicked. Like our sense of humour is pretty much the same and she just feels so easy to talk to. If this isn't the place to post this then please poimt me im the right direction because I'd love some other perspectives on this problem since I'm completely incompetent.

Anyways, I've begun to notice that I feel genuine excitement whenever she texts me and I feel really happy while talking with her. But on the flipside, I feel like she's opened up all the shit feelings as well. I've never struggled with depression before, but I think I have it now. I've cried myself to sleep at 3 am more times than I'd like to admit and whenever I make her unhappy in any way I genuinely feel like killing myself.

So my question is this : Is it worth it? Are the good feelings worth the underlying crippling sadness that feels like it keeps slowly eating away at me? I understand that this might seem like teenage angst but I really don't know this, I've never had to deal with this kind of situation. So any responses and different perspectives are welcome, thank you for reading.

**TL:DR** Met a girl this summer who makes me feel amazing most of the time. The downside is that now I think I have some sort of depression and suicidal thoughts.",4
Went out to a bar on New Years and ended up dancing singing and making out with this super cute random girl all night. We were popping bottles of champagne drinking straight from the bottle it was so much fun and the only intimacy I've had with a girl in probably over a year (I'm 22). I never even got her name or number but I'm so fucking lonely that I can't stop thinking about her. It's pathetic. She prob hasn't thought about it since yet I can't get it off my mind. I keep looking at Snapchat vids we took together too because it's the only fun I've had in years and I don't want it to end. Idk I feel like a fucking loser ,4
But every fucking day I have another thing to be depressed about. Like when will this end ,5
"I started to make a new friend and we got along so great. Joking around, hanging out everyday. I was feeling so confident and content and being myself. 

Then I made a * minor * mistake at work. I overplayed it in my head for going on a week now and its brought my anxiety back and I've been feeling so low for a few days. At this point I'm scared to hit up my new friend because I feel so much nerves because of outside stuff going on. 

Life starts to look great and then bam my mind and my nerves can get in the way and put me in my shell. 

Just venting...I'm really not happy with how this happens. I don't want to be lonely anymore !",4
"These are goals I want to keep for at least the first month of January. I'm going to be able to seek out therapy again now that I'll be living in Seattle for the rest of the year instead of bouncing between Seattle (work/school) and home for holidays.

*-I am done with talks of suicide with my loved ones.*

I understand it is so stressful to have a partner or a daughter or friend who just shuts down every other night and says she wants to die. Even though I tell everyone I will not kill myself because I couldn't bear traumatizing anyone, I know telling them I want to die isn't helping me or them. It's time for me to put away suicide as my cry for help. If I really feel low I know the folks at /r/SuicideWatch are comforting and I frequent the sub to offer support as well. They get me. I will probably share with my will-be therapist as well instead of family and friends because they are not my therapists. Brings me to my next goal.

*-Stop treating family and friends as therapists.*

And by this I mean dumping my existential crises on everyone is not okay. They don't know how to help. I shouldn't expect them to help. I need real counseling from someone with experience and someone who can actually listen without getting burnt out from me. I know everyone needs a shoulder to cry on. But I am chronically depressed and anxious and I am always asking for far too much when I ask for shoulders to cry on. I am asking for shoulders to cry on for hours long. It's not good for anyone.

*-I will take care of my body.*

I notice differences in my mood when I eat unhealthy and my binge eating only worsens this. Regardless if depression makes me binge eat or if binge eating makes me depressed, I need to clean my diet up. I did a really good job of this last summer and I believe I can do it again. I can do this.

*-I will believe in myself.*

No more negative talk downs. I have to believe I can be better than who I was. I have to believe I can be better. I want to see myself as better. Maybe depression will never go away. But I have to learn to cope sustainably. I have to stop giving up at every mountain and wall and obstacle.

*-I will expect care from myself and only myself.*

No more dependence on others. I need to become more independent because I am very attached and attach easily.

Maybe a lot of this sounds like keeping things inside and bottling up. But I want to be as transparent as I can when it is appropriate instead of when it is inappropriate. I want to talk to a therapist exclusively about deep personal woes. I can tell a friend about a bad day sure. But my deep issues are really too spoken of too often these days and I know it needs to stop.

"Hey guys.
I have been a long time lurker of this sub but have been to nervous/anxious to post anything. I apologize for my rambling, its been a long couple days. 

Honestly it's really hard for me to accept that I need help and can't ""help myself"". My family has a looonngggg history of mental health issues, I always thought ""I was the exception"", shit everyone else thought so too. My sister is bipolar, OCD, struggles with manic depression as does my mom. My brother unfortunately lost his fight with depression a few years ago. Actually, this month will make 7 years. I have always dealt with my anxiety quietly, kept it to myself. Through the years things have gotten...darker. I am in a happy relationship with my fiance, I have a decent job, a dog I love and a wonderful family but I've always felt pretty disconnected. Content...never happy...always foggy...incapable of feeling anything but sadness I suppose, I just thought I was super empathetic lol I have never found enough ""joy"" in anything to have any hobbies, which has always bothered me. Well. Here we are...about 5 years of straight downhill later and two days ago I started to have some kind of breakdown of the century that really came to a head last night and at work this morning. I am scrambling to hold on to any sliver lining I can find. I am exhausted. I have cried for 2 days straight, had the most obsessive...intrusive thoughts that i cant seem to shake. I am absolutely sick to my stomach and can not hold anything down. I feel like the part of me that has been fighting has literally given up and is begging for help, this current person is scary as hell. My boss made me call every doctor that took my insurance to get an appointment  asap after my...""episode"". I have an appointment for in the morning. I am terrified. The thought of medication really fucks with my anxiety. I get paranoid a doctor is just going to prescribe me stuff (like they did my brother) to get rid of me with out really LISTENING to me. But I am going to cross my fingers and hope for whatever ""best"" I can find. There has to be more to this life than what I am currently living. I can not feel like this for forever, I won't. I have no idea how I am going to make it through the night, but I am going to figure it out. Do any of you have any suggestions of things I should bring up with the doctor to make the most of my first appointment? Sorry for the wall of text.",3
"She saw it in her mind's eye like a movie playing, the haunting memories from her childhood she couldn't seem to shake blending together into one raw, aching image. Her mother lying in a darkened room for days, her face swollen with tears. The inevitable ashtray overrun with ashes, the acrid scent of pot smoke in the air. The bed or couch or futon may have been different from year to year as Evie moved them around from apartment to commune to funky cottage, but her mother was always the same. Falling hard for some man, immersing herself in romantic fantasies that were crushed when the guy left. And the guy always left. Her mother's inability to get a grasp on reality had too often left Mischa to care for her younger sister, to care for her mother, from too young an age. She remembered shaking Evie awake, trying to get her to eat. To get up and take a shower, take her and Raine to school. No kid should have to do that. No kid should have to witness the way Evie had allowed herself to be ravaged by love. No woman should allow that to happen.",4
"She said it's because our daily conversations in the past was something she deliberately attempted to adjust to because it's not her cup of tea.

I don't get her. I don't get her at all. I asked her why she hadn't informed me, because I wouldn't have found out if I hadn't brought it up. She said it was an out of mind, out of sight sort of thing and she doesn't really need to tell me every single thing, that she thought I figured it out, but eventually she apologized and said that it was disrespectful of her to suddenly revert to her usual ways when she knows I'm used to the contrary.

I... don't know what this all means. Am I boring? Does she not want me? Am I supposed to be mad at her? Is she worth keeping? What do you people make of this?",4
"I was sitting in my room just trying to deal with life, and all the shit that has been thrown at me in the last few years when out of nowhere there was this flash of memory, and I remembered that this isn't the first time things have been bad, and that things have actually been far, far worse. And I remembered that all those years ago, music was life. For a brief moment, I remembered what it was like to feel. For real music, honest music, you have to be able to feel. I remembered that I would drift through the day back then so numb to the world, but when I got home, plugged up to the amp, and put on my 100 dollar studio quality headphones and magically I could feel. I wanted to remember that, so it's just what I did. Been a *long* time so I had to do some digging, and almost got stuck in the memories held by all the crap in storage, but I found it. The main volume dial needs to be replaced, and I had to rewire the speaker to the amp, but it all still works. And I played. Nothing fancy, just tuning, and some finger exercises, and other ""warmup"" stuff. I can't really remember how to play much else right now, but I did the thing, and it was great. I think I smiled for the first time in weeks. ",5
I'm a 3rd (final) year law student in the middle of tons of essays due in 10 days and it's making me unbearably sad and lonely.

"Is... Is this really a thing? Another post recently had a reply pointing this out as a possibility of being a thing.

 My life isn't bad. It's not great, I'm not homeless and I have food and a roof... But I just feel like everything is wrong so often. If left to my own thoughts I sit and dwell on all I;m done wrong, how I may have upset people that day, do people actually care? Am I being manipulated for their gain and it's all fake 'love' towards me? 

I don't know what's wrong. I sit and cry for no reason just because nothing feels correct or right, but I don't know what's wrong about it. I'm afraid of upsetting people so I always shrink back at conflict. I'm afraid of seeming too needy so I never tell people when something is wrong. 


I have someone I care about, but I'm so afraid of burdening them with more problems about myself, when they have their own stuff to deal with anyway. It's not a... 'relationship' in the common use of the word, but someone that is important to me, so I don't feel I have the right to pester them or drag them down. And what would I tell them anyway? ""I'm uspet because nothing is right, but I don't know what right is, so I don't even know it's wrong anyway?"" That doesn't work... 


I'm not suicidal. I have no right to be. I don't think I have half the problems those that stand on that cliff must have in their life, so how could I possibly consider doing that? I just want to sleep so much. When I'm asleep I don't think, I don't dwell on how I feel. 


It's so dumb. I worry over even stupid stuff in video games with friends. I switched servers in a game recently, and I still contact and talk to all the people from the old server, but I still felt sick as I did it. I sat and cried over slighting those that I left behind on the old server, because I left them behind. 


Is this dumb shit I sit and think and do Depression? These thoughts of being worth nothing, thoughts that I'm hurting everyone around me by existing, forcing them to interact with me like I'm the unwanted little brother of your best friend that his mom forced him to bring along to play with. 


But now I have to wonder if I just manufacture all this myself. Make myself feel negative about myself to get... whatever I get out of that. Loop it around, driving myself more and more downward.

"Hello I'm new here, I signed up in hopes to vent my feelings. Christmas has bought up a hole new wave of depression. Last year (2016) I lost my best friend 
, he was the sort of guy who I could talk to about this stuff. My bestfriend used this site daily so I thought  I may also find comfort in it.
What keeps playing on repete in my head, my daily  thinking is my best friend.
I wonder what happened to him on the day I lost him, what was he feeling?why didn't he call Me?
He always said he didn't want a dramatic death but jumping off a popular suicide spot in the south East of England seems pretty dam dramatic.
Did it hurt I ask myself? Was it quick, or did  the sea catch him and hold him hostage, like a rag doll he would have been thrown around and smashed up against the rocks. Did he think of me? 
Was he high?drunk?....IDK
Just why didn't he call me or leave a sign, just a week earlier he told me how I was his soul mate, and I  believed every word. He said how we would get a house together when we are 30 and still failing at life. 
I wish I could talk to him, hug him,hold him, smell him.  We were planning  on meeting up for a weekend, we hadnt seen eachother in 4 years...we stl called most night but life had just taken us to seprate ends of the country in different directions. If I didnt leave home at 16 to move further away would he still be here?
I know none can answer these questions but the pain crushed me and I just need to get my feelings out, perhaps one day I will look back at this and it will hurt less or not at all.
I have a tattoo for him, the delta actually. It ment change, I have no idear why I got it but at the time I wanted apart of him on me. Change? Why didn't it work why couldn't he use his tattoo and that way he would still be here. 
His mother told me he was drinking still excessively  and all he wanted was to be perfect for when he meets me again....but.i could have helped. I did not care I was his help why would he not trust that.

"I'm 30 and have been depressed since 15, the age at which I realized I wasn't going to be tall and handsome and gave up on life. I get worse whenever I see porn, since I chastise myself for not having the genetics to date and bang hot women. I asked an aesthetics forum to rate pictures of me, they said 6-7, but it means almost nothing to me if it's not 9.

The one thing that keeps me from killing myself is thinking about how I could change my life around. I'm currently selling my stuff so I can afford lasik, then braces to fix my teeth. I'd also love to get limb lengthening on my legs by 3"" to make me about 6', but I have a small head and worry that I won't look good. I've done research on how to apply for gene therapy clinical trials and other radical reconstruction. I honestly don't care what the complications would be, I'm THAT unhappy. I think about suicide already, and I would end it if it happened to not work out.

I wasted a lot of time before realizing this ""my way or bust"" mindset, and I hope anyone younger than me can take away that you'll regret not solving your problems sooner if you don't start now.

"my girlfriend has a stomach ulcer, is very open to other guys, and that plus alcohol is all just such a bad combination, she is underage and i really hate when she drinks it makes me stressed out and very depressed.

well she went to work today, 4-8, and told me before hand her friend asked her to drink with her tonigjt for new years and she told me she said no and promised she would spend the time with me

out of the blue she said she might need to stay at work longer for new years, then switched the reason to her friend needed help at the front desk (the friend who asked her to drink), and she stayed there for another 6 hours, hardly messaged me, then sent a confusing message 3 hours ago and she stopped getting my messages since, she would be home by now from work and if her phone died shed charge it, but that makes 8 extra hours of work which is severely unlikely. i really think she drank and that is killing me on the inside

when the clock struck 12 i was alreadt crying and 10 minutes into the new year i cut myself, and now im in full blown panic mode because shes still not responding

she alwaus says she never lies to me, but if she drank tonihjt she broke her promise not to because she said she didnt like it, she crushed my hopes of being with her and i spent new years alone crying, and she completely destroyed my start to the year.

"I've struggled with major depression since I was probably 14-15 and I'm 25 now. I've tried several different medications and had many bad turn outs with that.

I realize I have to stop doing this, and I tell myself every single time that I won't do it again, but I always do.

He is simply the best thing that's ever happened to me. I have three of the world's most friendly cats. We live in a nice house, cheap rent for what we have. Awesome neighbors.and my favorite weather outside, sunny cold and crisp air with crunchy snow on the ground.

But I can't kick this depression. I'm attempting medication finally. Because after two years I finally gave in and am trying them. So far I feel worse than usual. I don't know if I have anything left in me to keep trying. In the evening I feel better and try to fill my days as best I can Because commitment seems to be the only thing that gets me out of bed.",4
"In sorry if I don't write back to any replies. my anxiety makes it kind of hard to answer people.. but ill read comments if I do get any.. 

I just had my second son. having to wait until the 17th to get back on my meds. I've been clean from severe self harm for the whole pregnancy. in trying hard to maintain. were all aware I will probably have post partum depression since I suffered so badly last time. its started already. 

we all know how scary it is to see yourself circling the drain. knowing you can't stop the fall. 

I have 3 people besides my toddler and newborn sons. my husband of 7 years, my mom, and my best friend. my best friend I don't really like to reach out to. even though she is amazing, I adore her and she's extremely understanding and supportive (because she struggles the same as me). I have an issue reaching out to her. I don't like telling her everything going on. I don't want to trigger her. and, I swear, no matter how much I adore her I just can't bring myself to reach out. 

my absolute best friend ever is my mom. she is a huge reason I have struggles but I have forgiven her over the years and were extremely close. the thing is, she is flaky. as. fuck. she is there for me so often I feel terrible for being upset but she often won't answer texts... like times where im really struggling. and just recently she told me ""I can't fix everything""... it hit me that im asking too much of her. the thing is... she told me she would be there for me since she is well aware of my mental issues. we all discussed my possibility of ppd plus my mental disorders acting up. but then she says that... so I feel like I can't ask for help again...my husband just went back to work and I've been doing ok but yesterday was hard. against the wishes of my depression I reached out to her... she had a new outfit for church.. she said shed come spend some time with me after church before husband got home... she didn't answer my messages. when she did she said shed be at my house ""soon"". it took an hour and a half to get to me with a 10 minute drive. by then mybhusband was getting off work within ten minutes anyways. she just picked up my son, her grandson, and left pretty quickly.. I even told her I didn't want to be alone... 

im a burden. always have been. 

I have a great drug regimen for my mental disorders. Is been hospitalized and my meds got worked out perfectly. well since my first son withdrew from my meds in NICU when he was born I wasmt allowed to stay on them for this last pregnancy. Understandable... I have a lot of guilt for making my oldest sick... 

well my pregnancy psych seemed wary of giving me my meds when I asked, excitedly, if I could have them back after baby was born... she kind of gave a ""well see"" answer... even though im fully diagnosed and im obviously mentally ill and I've told them how well my medications work. my arms are covered in pretty bad scarring. they know I need my medications. im also not on anything scheduled. I refuse things like benzos and adderal because of addiction issues. 

well after talking to my doctor last take and her seeming iffy on giving me my medications I've just been feeling more depressed that I may have to wait months tobget them. I got emotional today because im scared and depressed and he got frustrated with me. 

hes my only other support person. im out of options. he tells me I can talk to him but he just gets angry or frustrated with me. hes a good person. hes a great husband. he just gets upset that he can't do anything... 

but he had just told me yesterday I could talk to him about when im feeling down. then I get snapped at... I feel like I have no one again. 

I want to cut. I won't.. but I want to. I want to hurt myself in some way. I won't. I just want to. I just don't want to hurt mentally anymore. I want to talk to my people... but theyre tired of me. I want so bad to reach out instead of withdraw.. but I guess my only option is to just keep it inside. im tired of feeling like an attention seeker when I keep telling people I feel alone or depressed. or that I keep saying im scared of going downhill. I feel like im begging people to help me and everyone is just tired... 

I just don't want to hurt anymore. ",3

The lives these ppl lead my own age traveling all around the world and I can barely make it through a day at work just to get home and collapse into my bed feeling like I just ran a marathon and then got hit by a truck because of the never ending physical nature of this disease. I had an uncle that killed himself years back and my 32 year old cousin killed him self last year.

"Three years ago my dad died, it hardly feels like three weeks. It's like everything else in my life is so insignificant in comparison, it's like a black hole that distorts my perception of time. It's as if time passes 100x faster since it and everything before it is so long ago.

People say that after a major event in their life everything feels categorised into before and after it but to me it feels like things that are it and not, but most of them are.

People have been telling me since then that I probably have depression and should maybe get help but that's mostly just from seeing me because I don't open up. I feel like I've just always been a little gloomy and don't feel very different now compared to before other than the whole bending of time thing.

"Hello!
This is my first post on Reddit. English is not my native tongue so bare with me.

My mom and dad molested me from 0-18 years old. My dad got me pregnant at the age of 11. We went abroad and I had an abortion. When I was younger (before I hit puberty) they sold me to other men and allowed them to use me as they pleased for a night, sometimes a whole weekend. 

At 18 I got a good job and moved far away from them. Now I'm 23 and my life is very good. I married the man of my dreams and together we have a 1 year old kid. I know I should be happy but I always feel depressed and anxious. I have flashbacks everyday and nightmares every night. 

I'm starting a ptsd program with a therapist tomorrow and to be honest I don't want to go - I'm really scared. I don't know what will happen when I start talking about everything that happened when I was a kid.
I feel like my childhood was just too messed up and I will never get over it. I'm so tired of the flashbacks and the nightmares. I have too many bad memories. I don't want to live like this, I can't live like this. 

Do you think I can get over this and be normal?

"I'm 19, F and I absolutely hate my parents. They are the worst. All my mom does is take out her anger on me and criticize me. She is extremely judgemental in every single aspect that relates to me.

My parents are ready to buy him a brand new car, but won't let me have gas money for the car that's already at home.
My parents honestly treat my brother with so much love and support and it breaks my heart to see them treat me like I'm some unwanted part of their life. 
They have told me multiple times that I should grateful because they feed me and provide for my education, like that isn't the responsibility of parents? They make it seem like it's a great and big deal that I'm not abandoned. They treat me like a slave and I get in trouble if I don't do anything they tell me to do.
I honestly hate every single moment I stay at home. My parents and my brother always gang up on me and ruin my mood constantly.
I have seriously considered suicide in the past to get away from this hell and I still live with them. But I have realised that is too easy for them.

"The only social media I use often are Youtube and Reddit. I have a Facebook account, but there are no pictures or info and I don't go on it often. I gave in and was curious about what people were posting on New Year's Eve...and I immediately regretted it. Most people were posting their 2017 highlights and boy did they make me feel worthless. One that really got to me was the one who posted about their engagement, moving into their own place together, graduating college, traveling, etc. I just broke down crying for 10 minutes straight after reading her post. 2017 for me was a blur. I cannot give you any highlights of my life because there weren't any for me. Just a lot of crying and regrets. I have no friends or social life, so it's really hard for me to do anything eventful. I just sit in my room alone trying to pass time with the internet. I hate it so much. It is ironic with me because I hate how much technology has advanced (social media wise) and how people are always on their devices nowadays, yet when you look at me .. I am doing what I hate other people doing. Sometimes I feel like if I grew up in the 80s, my life wouldn't be so bad. I wouldn't have a computer, phone, etc to occupy me so I would not feel tired or useless and instead put effort into making friends. 

To anyone who read this, thank you so much. I don't post on here very often and just wanted to feel less alone by interacting with you all (since I am of course not doing anything exciting for new years). Happy New Years to you all regardless. Hope you guys have/had a better day than me.",4
"Hi,
I started college this year after a gap year and I went to a major that I was really excited about and I was preparing for it. It's arabic language and history major. 2 months in I knew something's just not right. One of the teachers is really demotivational and the classes were really hard. But I kept going because it was my dream to go to this school. Now it's finals month here in Czech and I just don't know what to do. I suck at the language, I tried but I just don't get it so I told my family and friends and everyone just says that I cannot give up! âYou have to go through finals! Give it a try!!! You have to push yourself and do the best!â 
But I'm pushing myself I guess I'm just not pushing as hard as everyone else. But I don't want to push too hard. I'm already really depressed I started going to therapy because of the school, I'm crying everyday. I don't think I can get through. 
Why is everyone telling me that I cannot give up? Why is âgiving upâ seen as such a bad thing for people? 

My long distance boyfriend is the only one who supports me the way I need. He is motivational and he's saying that it's okay to quit. But you know, he's not here and even though he is my support I need something to tell my family or just people around that they will get and not see as a bad thing to do (giving up).

"I have several problems. One of them is that I'm 52 years old and don't have a job currently. I've tried searching for jobs and applying but I can't find any.

Roughly a week and a half ago, I broke my ankle while out taking pictures at a local nature preserve. I tripped over a low-cut tree stump that was hidden under the falling fresh white snow. I was rushed to the hospital ER and operated on the following day where the put 2 plates and some pins in my ankle. A few days after that, I was sent to a local old-age home in my hometown to finish my rehab. I've been stuck here doing rehab ever since. My first appt. with the foot dr isnt for a week and then I'll know how everything is going.

I feel very frustrated being in this place and it drives me insane. Luckily I have a private room (it's semi-private but nobody is in the room with me) and they allow me to keep my door shut all the time. I have trouble with sleeping and they give me NYQUIL at night to help calm me down. 

Personally I would like to leave tonight but I have a ""non weight-bearing"" status on my foot and can't do anything at home yet. I'm learning to hop around on one foot and use a walker and everything but it is taking a lot of time. I'm very impatient sitting in this home though and wish I could do something (or my dad would do something) to get me to come home however since he's 80, he wants me to stay in here for a while to get better as well.

I constantly feel as though my life is worthless and this tragedy is just the latest in a long long line. I'm not sure how I can get my life back on track and I've talked to a counselor before for several sessions but really haven't come up with much in terms of solutions. Any help that you can provide would be greatly appreciated...

"I really don't know what to do. The only time I don't feel this just... soul-crushing sadness is when I'm with who I consider to be my best friend. I'm really bad at talking to people and when I try to talk to people about my problems they often don't take me seriously. I also have really bad self esteem.

I've come to realize that what I used to think were good, close friends were just people who were just people that have the ""I'm here for you, but as long as I'm having fun"" mentality. Once I came to this realization, I stopped being the one to initiate conversations and activities outside of school and sure enough, almost none of them invite me to anything or talk to me outside of school and I'm left feeling just.. alone.

Every time I'm around the people who I consider to be my real friends, I feel a bit better. When I'm not talking, I constantly just feel useless, empty and alone. I know my parents love me but ever since I confronted my mother about my problems, she both blamed my problem on playing too much video games and basically told me just to be happy.

Very few things bring me happiness at this point. I thought starting a channel on Youtube and making videos regularly would help take my mind off of my problems so I did for a while. Over the course of a few months, I've gotten some really nice comments telling me that they genuinely enjoy my videos and that they'd like to see more, and that really made me happy. But then once that feeling wore off I felt like I was back to square one. I wish there was a way to enjoy my life without having to work my ass off for a temporary solution

"I'm a 38(m), and I've been taking Cymbalta for a little over a year. About 2 months ago, I started feeling very depressed again for no reason, and having bouts of extreme anger. I informed my doc, and she doubled my dose to 60mg. Since then, my depression and anger have gotten much much worse.


My life is amazing right now. I have a wife who loves me and supports me through all of my depression and anxiety issues. She is learning how to talk me down off the cliff sometimes, but it is a crapshoot as to whether she is able to or not. I have two wonderful little girls, who bring me so much joy.


Yesterday, I had a terrible day all day. I can't get motivated to do what I need to do at work, and when I do, I have terrible anxiety that I'm going to fuck something up and get fired. I spent most of the day yesterday shaking at my desk, because I couldn't even make myself move half the time. I got home, and had a fight with my wife, because I was taking everything she said the wrong way, to the point that I eventually just broke down crying for NO REASON. I cried for probably 45 minutes over nothing.


These episodes are happening more and more frequently. The last time I remember feeling this way was when I got the bright idea to stop taking my Cymbalta completely, and that was an unmitigated DISASTER. I had a complete breakdown, and nearly left my entire family. I'm terrified that if Cymbalta has indeed stopped working for me that I'm going to have to stop taking it, and will end up having another breakdown.

"hi everyone

I had been doing so well, I was a year and two months SH-clean. I was planning a tattoo to get that would cover all my old scars. 

but tonight brought on an depressive episode that I've never experienced before. on my way home, I was wailing/sobbing, talking out loud to myself about what was wrong with me, and then I had a thought that ceased the wailing and brought me to complete silence for the rest of the night. 

âI'm going to kill myself.â

When I got home, I got into comfortable pajamas and researched lethal doses of the medicines I have in my cabinet. I wrote out a note, telling my family and friends that I love them. 

I was nearly about to take the pills, when my cat came around the corner and started purring. She rubbed herself around my ankles, meowing at me happily. 

I broke down in tears, realizing what I was about to do. I later cut myself, which I justified to myself as being an âalternativeâ to suicide. 

Time to start the countup over. ",3
"Hey everyone. Some context, I'm 16, sophomore, this all happened through my mid freshmen and mid sophomore year. I have pretty bad depression but got medication about maybe two months ago.

My once best friend lives over 7,000 miles away from me. She lives in South Africa while I live in the United States, specifically in central Texas. I met her on an app called ""talklife"" where you just vented about... life! I had made a post about how I hated myself, and I was in tears when one day she messaged me. She said she would be willing to be there for me and eventually our friendship really started to grow. She trusted me really quickly.

We mostly communicated on whatsapp. One day she randomly messaged me saying she hurt herself. It broke my heart. I wish I could have been there for her in person to hug her and be there for her. But I couldn't, but I did my best to comfort her. She opened up a lot on what she's been through. Bullying, parental abuse, and at one point a boy from her school pretty much threatened to rape her and nobody would take her seriously when she talked about it.

We both came to each other whenever we were hurt. I doubt she would ever admit it but she was a little clingy to me at one point, like she never stopped messaging me and sent me pictures and videos of herself randomly. She made me feel really important. But I soon became waaay more clingy than she ever was. I was very attached to her. Being the closest friend I have ever had and the first person I would go to when I was hurting. 

I think my clingyness to her, along with my insecurity and depression, made things start to go downhill in our friendship. The first time we had a fight was when I was having an awful day at school and I was dying to vent to her. I was holding in tears at my classes and needed to talk but she was busy and constantly going offline. I felt like she was ignoring me and I told her ""fuck you"" and blocked her. It was weird, I felt better after that. I shouldn't have, because I potentially just ruined a friendship, but I felt better just being nasty, like it got my frustration and hurt out.

I unblocked her and apologized but she was hurting. However I recorded a video of myself just talking and apologizing, and admitting how I was a dick, and she really felt way happier after seeing it and seemed back in a good mood. I was glad she wasn't holding a grudge and felt better after the video I sent her.

It may sound weird to send her a video of myself, but I think net neutrality is not a thing in South Africa, so she has some bundle she says where she can use a couple apps but is unable to call at all. It took me a while to understand.

We had a lot of arguments along our friendship. A lot of times I questioned if it was getting toxic. However whenever we explained both our sides and admitted our faults, we were on good terms again. However, I still think it was taking a toll on our friendship.

There was a point where we got into an argument about something, I don't remember exactly all the details, but here's what I remember.

So we had planned to want to visit sometime. One day I watched a documentary on South Africa over it's gangs and crimes, and I jokingly told her I changed my mind over visiting. It was a dick move to joke about but I told her I didn't mean it, and that she should calm down. She started going off on me and I kind of ignored it. She later posted something on her status with her parents hugging her and it's caption said ""abuse."" I know it seems like a joke, but she has told me about how her mom hits her and has made her cry in fear, and how she's felt suicidal because of how her mom treated her, so I wasn't sure. I told her if she needed anyone I was hear and she told me ""Uhm... it was a joke."" I know that doesn't seem rude to say, but by her standards it really is. I was pretty insulted and I started kind of going off on her.

Eventually I tried to apologize but she wouldn't respond. I called her a disease and she told me she wished me a good life but couldn't take this and blocked me, ""for good."" I messaged her through my brother, messaging her school's name. She had a uniform on her Instagram she gave me where it said her school's name in big bold letters, I didn't stalk her or anything. She unblocked me and kind of panicked, but I told her how I found her school's name. I texted her it because I learned freaking her out gets her to message people back. I said let's try to fix things but she wasn't budging. I started getting mad and feeling very hurt. I felt like if she was a real friend she would try to fix things with me, and not cut me off, especially considering how close we were. When I look back on this know, I was pretty stupid for how mean I was to her, and not realizing she was just tired of all the arguing and me hurting her.

I told her some incredibly nasty things, bringing up a lot of the things she struggled with and vented to me about, only to have me use it against her and break her down. I could tell I was getting to her, really making her hurt. I was acting like a sadist over her ""being a fake friend"" which she wasn't. Simply tired of the arguments, my temper and emotional bullying. She soon blocked me later.

I wish I realised that my reaction was so stupid. In my mind I just viewed her as being a fake friend, and never meaning any of the times she was there for me since she wouldn't want to fix things with me.

The feeling of her being a fake friend really hurt me and made me kind of crazy. I cried a lot because I felt so betrayed. I borrowed my friend's phone's to text her things like ""you should kill yourself"" and ""you just lost the only friend you had."" Just really nasty things. At one point, I made an entire account on Instagram dedicated to making fun of her. I posted dumb edits of her face and made posts going into detail why I thought she was a piece of shit. I followed a ton of her peers and got up to like 700 followers at one point. I informed her about it and she started freaking out.

A couple weeks pass. One day, a friend of her's, who was also mine too, saw one of my posts and sent it to her to maybe make her realise some of the scummy things she has been doing. I made them sound a lot worse than they really were yet not quite making it a lie. She said she wasn't going to read it and was starting to get over what I had done. My friend reminded her of the times I was there for her, and how if I was hurting this much she obviously meant a lot to me, and him saying that made her unblock me and forgive me. I was very skeptical but we talked things out and I deleted the account even though I still felt like she was being fake to me.

I needed to get somethings off my chest and in a voice note I told her how she had hurt me before the account was made, and I was still having trouble if I wanted to be her friend or not. She then told me that she was sorry for the hurt she caused, but then she told me the hurt she felt from what I did.

She said every day she walked into school terrified that someone would bring up the account. She would hurt herself and contemplated suicide constantly while the account was up and while I sent her those disgusting messages. She tried to force herself to be strong but all it did was push her suicidal urges down for a short time. She cried while saying all this and said she was scared to be my friend again, because she didn't want me to hurt her like that again.

It hurt so much. I started crying and really felt like shit. I explained more of the hurt I felt but also gave a deeper apology and explained more on things that had contributed to me being an asshole. She then recorded a very long voice note, I think about 9 minutes, talking about how she was sorry for making me cry and the hurt she caused before, and how she forgave me, and how she was my glad to be my friend again.

That feeling I had when we fixed all that shit was truly amazing. I felt so much better. But I also felt a lot of guilt for what I had done to her, but I was glad we were friends again. I tried to be kinder and more patient and understanding with her. But honestly it didn't work. We had another big argument shortly.

She told me she was planning on trashing her phone. I was really hurt. It was the only way I had to contact her, as she couldn't mail me since her mom couldn't stand online friends. I told her I was feeling like shit because of her doing this, but she said it was because she truly believed she would be happier without her phone, and she wasn't doing it to trash me. That's not how I felt and when I got those messages I had to lock myself in the bathroom and cry. I felt so unimportant to her.

We argued about it for a while but I kept trying to keep in my frustration and hurt. Then randomly one day I snapped. All those feelings of her being a fake friend came back. I told her I was so fucking done with her and if she ever messaged me again I would reactivate the account, and that she should go die in a hole.

A couple days later I apologized but asked her to still not contact me, and eventually after about two weeks I asked to talk to her. She said all the suicidal feelings came back and she went back to her habit of harming herself and crying to sleep. She kept saying things like ""go ahead, tell me I should die"" when I was apologizing and she eventually threatened to kill herself. I contacted her mom through one of her friends and told her to make sure she was okay. I know she was abusive but I know she wouldn't let her kill herself. She was okay, but she also told her all the things I did to her, which resulted in her mom telling me to kill myself and threatened me with a court case and tracking me down if she had to. Honestly wasn't worried about her threats at all, and even if I did get in trouble, well I deserved it.

So yeah, I am sorry this was so damn long. I just wanted this entire situation off my chest. I feel so guilty for how I hurt her and constantly cry at night because of it, and I miss her so much. I wish I wasn't such an asshole. I have never treated anybody so poorly in my life yet she's the closest friend I have ever had. I'm usually extra nice to girls and I was always there for her when she was hurting or needed anyone but sometimes my emotions would go crazy and my mind would get truly fucked up. A lot of it has to do with us being only online friends. I really don't treat any of my friends in real life like that.

I really wish she would listen to me apologize and kind of explain why I was hurt, and allow me to make it up to her by maybe like mailing her a gift. I miss her. I genuinely hope she's okay. I don't want to believe I'm an awful person because I do care about her, and so many other people in my life, but sometimes I'm just a terrible person with the way I explode. I don't know if I should forgive myself, I feel like I deserve to hate myself and have everyone around me hate me.

*TL;DR I emotionally tormented my best friend because I was so insecure and vengeful for times she really hurt me, even though it usually wasn't her fault, and it resulted in so much harm towards her. I feel like I deserve so much worse because of what I did.*

I've recently broke up with a guy I was on and off with for years. He said some pretty hurtful things about me and threw all the stuff I said to him in confidence in my face...such as no wonder you were abused as a child etc...I haven't mov d out of bed properly for 2 days and I feel awful as I have a 7 year old girl (dad is no existent) I always get bad bouts of feeling down and I feel suicidal. Ive tried but obviously not hard enough as I'm still here. I think my attempts have been really petty and I think I'm scared to do it properly..I also don't want to leave my daughter behind on her own having to deal with that. I have recently met a lot of my family and a lot are half sisters and a half brother. I have a full sister who has no decided to move to Australia with a half brother she hardly knows at all...I know I envy her in some way as I've always wanted to move abroad. I just feel so helpless. I try and think I can do things but then that little voice creeps in saying that I am worthless and there is no point. My ex did not help. He was an alcoholic and he was not helpful when he got drunk. He would just cry ad start calling me names etc sometimes over nothing or sometimes over a trivial matter...my daughter only saw bits of that side of him as I mainly went round during the day and there was times when he was such a lovely guy. I just don't know what to do. I want to get away but every time I try something gets in my way. My daughter is great and she's so polite and has a great personality. I have been snapping at her lately and it's not fair on her. I feel like just being me is destroying her and I just don't feel like I deserve to be in other people's presence. I try and put a front on and be happy when I used to go out and I think people just get fed up because I probably say or do something stupid.

"So on boxing day, the people I live with (Dad, step mom, step sister and little brother) went to stay at my step moms dads as it's a bit of a tradition. So I went to my moms house.

Hopefully getting drunk... again...
So we invited the old man my mom looks after for dinner. We ate, he enjoyed it so did we all then after all that we took him home. Aftet that we went to the store and brought some echo falls, dissarrono ( can't spell for shit sorry ) and coke. I'm 16 so I gave my mom the money for it lol. 

So when we got home I decided to get pissed. Nearly drank the whole bottle of dissarrono in about an hour. Totally fucked. So my retarded self decided to have a breakdown and then tell my sister that I think about killing myself every day and night and that I hate my life so much. I was a mess. But she laughed while I was in tears. Funny right? I also pretend to slit my wrists with a fork which was the first thing I grabbed out of the cookery. Kinda wish I pulled out a knife. 

She didn't say a word about it in the morning nor did my mom who was upstairs trying to sleep. 

Few dayd past, family go to my step disters cousin's family party, so I go to my moms again, and decided to jam along to my music with my mom in the kitchen, it then got to the depressing music and it ended up my mom pretending to slit her wrists and said to me ""No wonder you've been feeling depressed listening to this shit"" I wish I said to her that it helps me or some crap like that. Fun right?

"Recently I received some bad news at home â another health issue one would think would never impact me, even indirectly.  I don't want to get into those details, but it led me to decide I needed to stop medication because my âluckâ is so bad no matter how good the medication I am still going to endure an incessant stream of negative events and circumstances that will overwhelm me.  My life is a story of waste: Brilliant, but not using that brain power at work; successful, but not enough to reach my goals.  Nothing ever comes easy and I see bad people left and right get their way.  It drives me nuts, and feeds into the âblack and white thinkingâ that plagues me.  So I met with my doctor to ask how to get off my medication altogether.  Previously, he expressed shock at the cocktail I was taking and said he would not continue the malpractice of my old doctor, who recently closed her practice.  He did not try to convince me to stay on the medication, or change to something else.  I'm thankful he was honest about the methods to get off the pills.  But, it turns out the safe way to get off my medications will require over a year of weaning off them.  I wanted to stop going to doctors soon, but now I have to go through this process for over a year.  I handled the news well, surprisingly well. Still, it is incredibly difficult to live with my negative thinking, disturbing life events, a constant sense of failure and inadequacy, and potential withdrawals so serious I have to go through a year of tapering off meds.  I just needed to vent.  I feel like I have no one and nothing.  I constantly mutter things under my breath (often without realizing it) such as âI hate my life.â  It's just hard to see how the story of my life turns out well.",3

"Can't stop the negative thinking about how everything in my life is fucked up beyond repair. Through poor decisions and also situations and circumstances out of my control, I have zero future and no way of changing anything. 

I've become trapped in a cycle of chronic pain and depression/anxiety. It's hard to tell the difference anymore between whether one causes the other or vice versa. 

I can't work because of pain and crippling depression, but I've also been denied Social Security because I've been told that I'm not disabled enough or depressed enough to where I couldn't just shove pills in my mouth and do something--not that I want to be eternally damned to living on a fixed income. 

Things were supposed to be so different. I was on my way to a rewarding career and making damn good money, then everything crumbled, and I literally lost everything. All of my intelligence and good looks didn't do anything for my life against physically disabling conditions and chemical imbalances. 

Now I can't stop the carousel of shitty thoughts that just plays over and over in my head every day. 

I have zero friends anymore, I don't talk to my family, I don't work; honestly, I barely even leave my house. My shitty ex wife has done everything in her power to punish me and alienate me from my children after I could no longer care for them half time anymore after my injuries and spiral downward. 

Now my life is so small. I'm going insane from boredom and isolation and I get full blown panic attacks trying not to think about how everything is so fucked up and how I really can't fix it. 

I have bipolar II, PTSD, OCD, ADHD, and GAD.

My life is a shit show. I just want to run away and never come back but I can't actually run anymore. Lol. And I have no money. And I love my children too much to abandon them. My children keep me alive but also are part of the reason why I am so depressed and anxious about my life. Kind of fucked up in that way. 

I honestly don't know how to handle myself anymore. It's gotten to the point that I will literally just stare at my phone and lay in bed the entire day. I struggle to even put food in my mouth and when I do it's usually only so I can get drunk and not be as hungover.

My boyfriend was always there for me even though, at the time, my anxiety wad mainly caused by him (emotionally). He understood and was the only one who could calm me down.  Post emotional shit I was also very depressed because I was disappointed in the person I became. Because morally I'm very black and white and I let my boyfriend fall in my Gray space.

"I need some advice on coping techniques or strategies to avoid crying. It happens too often in the middle of conversations or when people are even a LITTLE mean (sometimes even jokingly so).


&amp;nbsp;


-Meds are not an option- I have been on them and they have negatively affected my health so had to quit (blood pressure and weight on various types).

-I have anxiety with depressive episodes (but no mania). Not bi-polar, no clear ""type"". Probably would need a second opinion, which I can't afford right now (and not sure it'd be helpful- psychiatrists spend so much less time with patients than therapists- whom I prefer), and haven't found a free therapist/sliding scale one that I like. Only one I really trusted/got along with is way out of budget.

-I cry at the drop of a hat. Certain things people say can trigger me (even if I know they had no idea it was a sensitive topic). Sometimes I emotionally and physically feel nothing about a topic and think I've gotten past it, and feel no physical reaction or feelings when it's brought up, but can still end up in tears. People's tones of voice can make me cry, even if I'm in the superior position (I.e. a high student today who I know has emotional issues and trouble at home yelled at me...It wasn't personal, he's just an asshole or takes out his issues on others...But I almost ended up crying as soon as the students left the room. I laughed to keep from crying in that instance but it upset the student and obviously was not the best coping mechanism- I did not consciously choose to do this by the way. I should have yelled back, but trouble is, when I feel angry/anger...I fucking cry).

-I know this is a dopamine or seratonin issue in part because the SSRI I was on cut my crying to 1/5 of how often I cry right now (off meds almost 6 months now), and I only cried when I actually felt sad (I.e. a super sad movie, a relative in the hospital, I really hurt myself by stubbing my toe really hard).


&amp;nbsp;


Please provide any resources that you can if possible. Or advice on meditative practices, or ways to trick my brain off of focusing on something that may trigger tears. I can't afford this affecting my professional life, as it's already affected my personal life (I hardly have made any new friends in the past year, all of my friends are from before I left school, and they were understanding because grad school is super stressful...But it's not normal to be like this now).

Thank you in advance. This is really ruining my life.",3
"I don't know if I'm depressed or not, but I do know that ever since October 12th my emotional state has progressively gotten worse. I don't know how much detail we are meant to go into, but that day was I suppose, borderline traumatic... I still remember it vividly. Crying on and off afterwards. 

Since then, I've had okay days where I was relatively happy. There's days when I don't cry, and others where I cry a few times... 

I don't have that much self confidence... I draw and I'm supposively smart, considering my 4. 0 GPA, but... I guess I just compare myself to people. 
I'm not smart, my brother is way smarter. 
I'm not a good artist, just an amateur trying their best. 
I'm not pretty, I have pimples and I don't smile enough. 
I have thoughts like that... People are their own worst critic, right?... but, I don't know if that's necessarily true. I'm overly sensitive, I've noticed. If anyone yells at me or nitpicks my flaws, I'll go off and cry, or at least feel like crying. An insult isn't enough to hurt me much, it's when its personal, Especially when it's my close family and friends saying it.... 

I've almost lost my best friend twice over arguments we had. She's clinically depressed. I can't help her. But I keep trying. During the first argument, I experienced my first and hopefully last panic attack. I've had more common anxious feelings sense. Both times I sobbed for many, many minutes. The pain and worry was unbearable. I didn't want to lose her because of something I did, especially. 

I often blame myself for the things that go wrong. I apologize a lot. I'm too irritable. I'm always tired. It seems like my memory has gotten worse. I'm jumpy, for some reason, especially with loud noises. My drawing hobby, talking with friends, and the internet are mostly the only things that make me happy. But it never lasts. I just wish it would... 

I am a Christian and so are my parents. I try and bring up my feelings with my mother but she insists that it's hormones and I should pray more. I thought she'd understand because of what her life had been like. I thought she'd understand since she's experienced anxiety and depression first hand. Again, I don't know if I have anything wrong with me. I haven't been anywhere. I've asked her to take me somewhere but she says I'm being a hypochondriac and believing myself into a depression. I don't think so. I just want to not hurt, is that so much to ask for? I love her, but I wish she would understand.... 

I've been sensitive to arguments since an argument began this whole ordeal and has caused problems in my closet friendship. 

I also suspect social anxiety is a possibility, but I'm really not a professional. I don't know, I just know that it effects my social life in several ways. 

When I get sad, as I often do when I'm not distracted, it hurts a lot. Physically, too. Like.. In my chest or stomach. It hurts so much. I can't handle it very well, or anything for that matter. 

I don't believe I'm suicidal, but... There have been the occasional thought of wanting to die. I'm not sure though. I want to live. But... Not like this. Not suffering... 

Anyways, here's my rambling about my feelings. If you guys could help me understand them better and maybe give advice, I'd appreciate it. 

Thank you for your time. ",5
Now I'm just drunk and more depressed than I was. Great. ,5
I can't take this shit anymore and need someone to chat with. Please.,4
"I never had much friends throughout my life. Never really hang out or play tag when I was a kid. I was a obscure kid with your self-esteem. Occasionally got bullied, cried a little, didn't tell anyone and lived on with it. I have make some pretty good friends after I grew up, they were friends I could talk with. We're now working adults now and well, we drifted apart.
I'm at my work, have no problem with social interaction and self-esteem anymore. I feel like my life have been a performance. I fake a smile to my colleagues, to my parents but I know that I'm still that kid, wanting something more from life. I questioned myself have I ever been happy and no I have not. I feel like a failure in everything I do. Every step I take forward just spiral me deeper. I thought I could outgrow depression, but living into my late 20s, I don't think thats possible. Maybe I just hate myself, maybe I hate society for making me this way.
The only thing that is make my life worth living is entertainment that keep my mind from thinking about my depression, pushing me onwards till I finally die. ",1
"When people say happiness is a choice it makes it seem to me that they're saying happiness is being dangled above me and if I jump high enough, if I strengthen my legs enough I'll be able to jump high enough to reach it.

When in actuality, because I suffer from depression, how It feels to me: I'm trapped in shackles, and I can see happiness behind a glass wall. It's illuminating and glowing, and I can see others basking it it's glow, prompting me to come join them. Then they start trying to yell encouragement at me like âyou can do it!â âCome get your happiness,â âyou're not trying hard enough!â âTry harder,â but it doesn't matter how much I struggle against my shackles I can't reach it, I can't get to it. I could struggle until my limbs bleed, and I still wouldn't be able to reach it. 

Because with how my mind is, it's an unobtainable dream. Then when others try to suggest it's from lack of trying, well it feels like they're rubbing salt in the cuts that the shackles have dug into my limbs.",5
"So sometimes when I am super lonely, depressed, and bored I enjoy a lot of ""alone time"". Well, its not even that I am enjoying it, more like I distract myself by getting off a lot. This can't be a normal way to cope. I'm thinking maybe because I recently stopped drinking and I don't smoke or do drugs that this is kinda like a crutch or something??",5
"I've been mostly happy with my life the past couple of months, I might even say that I've been happiest than in years. But I still just don't care if I would die right now. I'm not feeling like doing anything to myself anymore, but I often find myself thinking how much easier it would be if I would just be dead. I don't really want to deal with everything that life's going to push through my throat because even if I'm happy now I know there will be a shit show later.

Can someone help me to get some perspective?",0
I been battling depression since I was 11 and I am 27 now. Just don't wanna go away. ,5
"Lately mind feels as if its becoming numb. I space out frequently. Lately the only way I can describe them is increasingly thorough. Like, im spacing further and further out, and its becoming increasingly difficult to pull myself back or out of it so to speak.

Im smiling a lot more. But that fuzzy bulb at your core a genuine smile sparks seems to have significantly dimmed and i am incresingly afraid that it is flickering out. 

I feel so empty and outside of myself most of the time. It feels like there's some sort of invisible glass window between me and people i talk to. Everything feels so artificial.

I feel like im losing touch. ",5
"I struggle with depression and anxiety pretty severely. I struggle with understanding who I am. I struggle with meeting new people and maintaining relationships. I struggle in what feels like every aspect of my life and it seems to get worse over time. I've been trying therapy, but my sessions feel so impersonal and unproductive. I am new to his community and I want to say that making the decision to join was one of the best things I could've done for myself. I see so much love and support, it's truly beautiful. It makes me feel so much less alone in all of my struggles.

Please feel free to leave a comment. Tell your story. What do you struggle with? What do you do to help get you through the day? ",5
"I'm crying my eyes off and it's really pathetic. It's only day two of the new year and I spent the first day in bed. I really just need courage to kill myself, it's so hard to keep up a front and try to be positive about a future I can't picture. I'm so tired. How many more such years to come? Wouldn't it be easier to just let go? I really hate the innate instinct to survive, if not for that I could just end my life already. I'm just really sad and really tired of being sad.",5
So a happy new year to you all and I wish 2017 will be good to you.,0
"As I get set to go to bed at 6pm on NYE (the first %#&amp;$ing NYE I got off from work in years and can't find any plans), I've come to realize that this year, the holidays have done nothing but make me angry. Seeing others having fun, holiday decorations, stuff that are supposed to bring joy...

did nothing but piss me off.",5
"As my depression has only gotten worse and worse over time, this is quite obviously the worst New Years I've ever had. I'm here, laying in bed, browsing this sub while occasionally checking Snapchat to see all of my friends out having the time of their lives. I was invited to a few parties, but it's wishful thinking to imagine myself having gone to any of them. So here I am, in this shithole apartment, with my mother sleeping in the bed next to mine so I can't even get up to have a smoke without waking her. I'm only 17, I should be out having fun, meeting people, experiencing my youth, but my depression and anxiety are so bad I could hardly muster up the courage to even set foot outside. I can't believe this is how I ended up. I know I know, I'm still young, I haven't quite âended upâ anywhere yet, but I've more or less made up my mind that suicide is the end goal. And with how bad my depression is getting, it's gonna happen sooner rather than later. Anyway, Happy New Year. I hope 2018 won't be as rotten as 2017 was but odds are I won't make it halfway through before knotting up a rope and hanging myself. ",5
"I've personally thought about it -- several times a week when times were bad, and each time it was ruled out as a non-viable solution. I do, however, consider it an option on the table if circumstances call for it. 

The issue I want to address is the stigma on suicide.

I know people that have been clinically depressed for decades, and I've watched them take no joy out of life. Why prolong it if you've been dealt a shitty hand? Is society being selfish in wanting to see that people can change for the better just to affirm its own views of the world? The mere mention of suicide brings throngs of people trying to ""help"", and often instilling false hope. Will we ever ever say, ""yeah, it's a shitty situation. Offing yourself is probably the best option.""

There is no cure for clinical depression, and I bet those who eventually do kill themselves were dragged through the mud before they did it, effectively prolonging their suffering. 

If time is an endowed right, each of us should have the freedom to choose what we do with it. If your friend had been served a bland dish, would you ask him or her to try to savor the ""silver lining""?",0
"I don't like the girls how like me and I allways fall for the ones who don't like me back :/

"I am 25yr male from India and am living in the US since last year with my parents.

They have always had domestic quarrels and sometimes violence since as far back as I can remember.

This had scarred me for life as I didn't have confidence to talk to any person, I never had a girlfriend nor did I pursue any marriage choices.

I did separate from them for a brief period while I left to train for IT at a different city after my Bachelors.
But then, our immigration case which was pending since more than a decade in backlog was processed and we all migrated to the US.


Here, the tides turned dramatically, at least for my life.

I moved here to study, but I was forced to drop out because my father won't spend any money to care for my ailing mother.

Furthermore, my relatives here abandoned us and even troubled us to the point where they destroyed years of relations and blood lines.

Additionally, I was forced to take job at a crappy place to bear the burden of my Narcissistic Father, my obsessive mother and my innocent young brother.

My Father is more than just frugal but a Miser.
Not caring for his family he buys properties in India while his family suffers here.
He would've killed my mother by not providing her with day to day food and sanitary products had I not abandoned my education and put my hard earned money to provide for her.
He constantly troubles, teases and incites quarrel.
He acts in mischief making my mother shout loud at him and disturb the neighbors.

My mother on the other hand is so obsessive that she sometimes won't even let me sleep alone and would herself sleep on the floor of the room.
She always would be pin pointing at me for trivial stuff.
Would not let me study nor work in solace.

Granted this is an over affection of motherly nature but coupled with my father's mischief is disasterous.

She can argue with him for DAYS (I'm not kidding) on end without even eating a morsel of food.

I can continue for pages but coming to the gist.

My father was doing the same mischief again and my mother called the police on him. Saying that he is abusing(she intended verbal, police assumed physical) the children and her and not letting us live peacefully.

This happened at the end of a shouting session between my parents which all happened in the apartment I leased on my crappy salary from the job I had to take after I had lost all hope in life and no relative or friend would help us.

The police had to write down my name as well as my parents and confirmed that as long as no one physically assaulted anyone they can't do anything.
But if they continue shouting and the police has to come again, they'll take one of my parents away.

Now, I am again scarred to life as I was when I was a kid, a teenager, a young adult and now again.

Country doesn't matter, relations don't matter, dreams and aspirations don't matter to my parents.

They are narcissistic and obsessive fools.

Despite being a University topper and despite being a top notch Computer Programmer, I couldn't fulfill my dream, I couldn't study for my Masters and I couldn't prepare myself and work for a good company.

They have now spoiler my life again and possibly for the last time.

Now I wish they would just leave me alone and be off on their ways.",4
"With the new year starting tomorrow and me being introverted. I'm confused on what do to tonight. 

I feel very alone around the holidays and try to make an effort to be with people because if I don't then I start a pattern of self-deprecation and self-hate and thoughts of suicide start to creep in.

My parents and brother are going to a friend's house (two of my former teachers) to ""have a good time of fellowship"" and blast fireworks at midnight. Totally sober. They want me there. I plan on drinking tonight and it would not be allowed for me to drink around my parents and their friends or my brother.

I have a friend that I went to high school with and we are good friends, like the type where we can go without talking or seeing each other for months but when we see each other we're still good friends. She kind of invited me over to her boyfriend's house for tonight. He works for a beer distribution center and has loads of beer. They smoke weed and have also told me about times when they've done cocaine. I want to spend time with my friend but I don't want to partake in smoking or snorting tonight. I think I have an addictive personality and cocaine might not be a good thing for me to try. Also i really don't want to get crossfaded. I'm not really sure if I should go to her boyfriend's house.

It seems like I only have a couple options, be stone sober with boring people and watch fireworks, be drunk with a friend and her boyfriend where coke might be available, or sit at home with my own stash of booze and bring in the new year alone.",3
"I hope this is the right place to post this... It's now 2018, but I don't feel like it's a fresh start at all. I hate most aspects of my life and I've been getting steadily more depressed since I started middle school, and I'm a senior in college now. I started having more genuine thoughts of suicide lately and yesterday spent an hour last night researching methods for attempting. I don't want to talk to anyone around me, because it's pointless and makes things worse. Counseling at school didn't help me and just ate up more of my time and worsened my problems in school. My parents wouldn't understand because their mentality is that if I have any problems, it's because I'm lazy not depressed, so I can't discuss anything with them. I feel trapped, because I've had dreams and goals from childhood that I just can't see happening anymore because of what my parents are forcing me to do and my physical health is declining too, leaving me feeling weak and physically insecure all of the time. I don't know how to fix any of this, and I just want peace. I'm tired of feeling pain and exhaustion all the time and being punished for underperforming as a result. I hate that none of my goals for life worked, and no matter how much being under the pressure of my parents has ruined my life, they'll still be angry with me without considering or caring that I'm mentally and physically broken and never even wanted this. I don't see the use in continuing such a stupid routine where I breakdown so often and am trapped. Even if I fail, I'd be happier being locked up in some mental hospital than staying in my current situation. I want to be done.",2
"https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4q2zxb/im_going_to_kill_myself_on_123116/

I'm so fucking annoyed and tired of feeling like only 1/2 a person all the time, feeling a whirlwind mix of negative emotions but never feeling positive ones except in rare, fleeting circumstances. I don't deserve this. Maybe it's caused by childhood trauma, maybe it's genetics, maybe it's just shit luck, I don't know for sure, but I sure as hell didn't ask to be plagued with social anxiety and depression; I won't allow 2016 and how shitty it was to kill me. Yes, I became suicidal a month into it, yes I hated myself for most of the year and used self-deprecating humor to express how I felt, yes I started self-harming and cutting myself over the summer and did it more or less regularly for the rest of the year, yes my anxiety reached new heights and started interfering with my life and career, but what do I say to that? I'M FUCKING DONE. I have done nothing to deserve this. I've done some regrettable things in my life, but nothing so bad that would make suicide a justifiable decision. I want to taste happiness and ""feeling okay"" for once--and not just that, but for a long time; I know I'm naturally prone to feeling depressed and like shit, but that doesn't mean I need to accept it. Even if I'm going to die, it doesn't need to be by my own hand, at the end of a gun barrel pressed against the side of my skull. I want to have a successful and flourishing career, I want to have fun in my 20s's, I want to experience all that is, I want to fall in love. Deep inside my head, there's still that part of me who wants to sabotage everything I strive for, who wants me to kill myself, who picks up the knife and cuts myself, who tells me I'm an unattractive piece of shit who should die. Fuck that guy. I will not go gentle into that good night. I will rage, rage against the dying of the light. I will make 2017 my bitch.",4

I hope 2018 brings us good things ",4
"I don't know where to start or how long I want to type. It just comes and goes. So if I stop, I stop. I don't honestly expect anything to come from this. Sorry, I know this sub helps people, I just feel it's way too late now plus i've never had much help in the past. I understand that I am damaged and unable to maintain friendships or show kindness. 

But I knew him for two years. He had just gotten out of one abusive relationship and into another. I was there both times. I assure you I didn't do to try to get with him. I didn't think i was capapble of love. But he liked me. He liked me for what I was. He didn't see this thin, blonde girl with scars. He saw something different.

But, he got back with his second ex who then abused him some more. She would cut if he wouldn't talk to her, laugh at his misfortunes. I was the one he went crying to every damn time. I was there when nobody else was.

They broke up, big suprise and he asked me out. I said yes and entered two happiest months of my life. Followed by the 4 most miserable months until he finally showed me mercy and dumped me.

He would constantly mock how skinny and pale I am. How my scars are easily noticeable, gee I never noticed. Laughed at my stories of abuse. But I loved him. I was stupid and I deserved to hurt. He would cut himself and encourage me to. I'm actually 7 months clean as of today but it's so hard not to go back.

Now he's back with his ex again. And I hope he suffers. Bad. I'm tired of being used. I'm tired of being a freak. Why was I born this way? Why am I hated so? Fine. I give up. I wanted to go into more detail but i've wasted enough time and I don't wanna type no more. Sorry......",4

I want to pretend it's okay around the people I care about, but I can't managed that anymore. Who do I blame? Is it my fault? I can't help but feel like I failed.

"Hey, first post on here!
I feel weird. I don't feel bad, just weird. I've been feeling like this for quite a while. Like two years or something.
Let me give you some background. I'm a 16 y/o dude living in Norway. I have it well. Life is good to me. 
I get good grades at school (B/A), I have (some) friends, I have a nice family (my parents got divorced ~3 years ago, but that's fine).
Everything is just fine.

But somehow I feel like my whole life is ""meh"". I don't see any point in doing anything. 
I have hobbies; I like video games, I play the piano, I make videos, I do some photography. I have interest in politics. 
I go to a school where I do things I like; photography, video game design (yes, Norway is weird and privileged), video editing etc.

I just lose motivation so quickly. ""Oh, I'll play this game."" Ten minutes go by. ""Uh, this is boring/unrewarding/I could be doing something better/etc."" 
Or; ""Oooh, I'll make this video game."" I work on it for 2 days. ""I could just go back to not doing anything, and not have to do this.""
I've been trying different things. I don't know why this happens, really. Do I think long-term before I think short-term?

One good (recent) example of this is New Year's Eve; everyone is emotional and screaming ""Happy New Year"" like it's some sort of rebirth. No. 
The number in the calendar is different, and there's gonna be another Christmas in 12 months. That's all there is to it in my opinion.

I don't know, is there some secret to life? Am I just gonna one day wake up, feel completely different, and have endless energy to do everything?

(P.S. I don't know if this qualifies as ""depression"". If this shouldn't be posted here, could somebody direct me to somewhere this can be posted?)",0
"It seems like my 15-mid 20's I've had depression, I'm 25.

And these last few months hit me hard: I love to learn, I love learning about the world, the universe, programming in C++, etc. But reading philosophy made matters worse, I couldn't even get into discussions like free will or determinism, or simple politics; even worse if nihilism, existentialism, the existence of God, the soul, quantum mechanics, etc. were involved.

I noticed I had problem. I kinda just realized that nobody knows what's going on. Those questions, the big whys and hows are somehow preventing me from carrying on with my life. I was upset because it feels like there were no answers to those things. I still can't think straight, I get very emotional sometimes, crying in secret (I know, I should tell others). I think it has to do with my childhood: My mother is a hoarder, my father is an alcoholic who sometimes beat her, and they sometimes threatened to harm each other with knives and guns, my father went on long trips away, sometimes the police were involved. My mother would beat me and my brother, with belts or brooms (or la fabulosa chancla), sometimes for doing bad things... that's how they (and us, by proxy) were raised. But my sister and younger brother, haven't been hit once after I was 15. I know they wanted better for me and my siblings, deep down. And I don't want my siblings to feel any similar things, but they still live with my mother in a house full of junk. I want to help my parents, they're divorced now, but I want to help them. Has anyone gone through something similar? Is there anyway to help?

So anyways, back to this 2017. I'm gonna start meditation, connect with my family and long-time girlfriend, focus on studying, maybe start a local rock band with friends. How about you guys? What are you guys planning?

Happy New Years.",4

"I don't even know how or where to start but I NEED to get a lot off my chest. 

My ideal life has always been to have a happy family. But I'm a very shy person, and never really liked the social scene. It makes it really hard to meet new people, but by a stroke of luck i met the most amazing girl back on September 30 2001(i was 18). We quickly fell in love, had a daughter, and got married. I thought we were a match made in heaven. I loved my life, i had everything i ever wanted. She made me want to be the best person i could be. I love this woman with every fiber of my being, but in early 2007 we hit our first road bump. She said she was unhappy and wanted a divorce. I tried everything to repair our marriage. I spent thousands of dollars on couples counseling, therapy, and spent every waking moment trying to resolve our issues. I found out 6 months into or troubles that she was sneaking around behind my back and sleeping with an old friend of hers from school(while we were still married). Even with that being the case, i still tried to fix our relationship because all i ever wanted was a complete family and for her to be happy. I guess her mind was made up though, because right after new years 2008 she gave me divorce papers. I love her and didn't want to fight it and cause her anymore stress so i signed the divorce papers bawling like a baby. The divorce was pretty much a 50/50 split but i let her take everything but our daughter and my PC, again because all i wanted was for her to be happy. Hell, i didn't even ask for child support even though i did everything for our daughter. I still tried to talk to her and let her know she was still very much loved, but soon after the divorce she remarried to the guy she cheated on me with. So, for the last 10 years i have been alone with just me and my daughter. I've tried to meet new women but i can't seem to find anyone that wants to be with me for more than a couple dates. I think it's because my depression, but i don't know. I haven't even had sex since 2007. I've tried apps and going to bars, but i don't drink alcohol so i feel awkward. I'm tired of being alone. I was raised by my grandparents and they have since passed on. I have NOBODY in my life that loves me besides my daughter. I want to find someone that can love me and my little girl as much as i could love them, but @ 35 years old it's beginning to feel impossible. Why won't anyone love me back? What is wrong with me? How can i find someone to love? I'm scared of dying alone. I'm worried my heart will remain broken till my death. I'm not a bad guy. I work very hard to make sure my daughter is happy, but without a proper mother figure i fear her life will mirror mine, and honestly if it wasn't for her i would've bitten the bullet years ago. She is all i have left. No siblings, no parents, no cousins or in-laws. I have nobody...

 I don't expect there is much(if anything at all) anyone can do for me here, but i want my story to be known.",4

I don't even know why I'm writing this but I guess it's better than keeping it to myself",5
"What if I have an amazing family, and amazing boyfriend, amazing friends, amazing schooling, amazing financial status. 

What if I have no reason to be depressed? 

All of my family is coming over this afternoon to enjoy the night and I'm crying in my room, afraid and tired. 

But all I can think about is how tired I am of life. How nothing is bringing me joy anymore. I have no reason to live. 

Is anyone else feeling this way? Please PM me. I feel so done.

"So here I am again, at another new years celebration time after 2017 flew by. I just can't do this life thing anymore, its so stupid and pointless, I just don't care anymore, I wouldn't be losing much being dead. I have nothing to live for, and I am a loser. Im sick and tired of this life, and I just want to move on. I am due to turn 21 now, and you know what, TO HELL WITH THAT! Id like to die now, as a young person. I don't want to live into the future, I don't want to grow old, the way I see it, things are all getting progressively worse, and I feel like the future will be miserable. There is no point in continuing anymore. I don't like myself, I don't like what I see in the mirror, I don't like the time I was born into, I don't like my situation, I don't like my own personality, Everything about myself and my life I HATE THIS WORLD, I don't want to continue to be a part of it. It is extremely unfair, and horrifically materialistic. There just isn't any point, Its over. So maybe i'll get out my old power saw and slash myself open. Thats how I should die. The death of a person filled with self hatred, should die in the most brutal way possible.  ",5
"My pipes have either frozen or the water shut off during the night. It's 19 degrees inside my house as well as outside. My car busted a line before Christmas. Nothing but bad luck and bad news this year and I'm sick of it. To top it all off, I have no money and no food in the house. I just need a fairy godmother or a winning lottery ticket, or SOMETHING. I'm hurting.",2
"Im at rock bottom and I don't know where else to go with this so here I am

I've been depressed for awile now and there were some events today that got out of control, my sister broke a drone that I got for Christmas and my mom did nothing I got pissed and threw the controller and stormed back to my room my mom's solution tell me I'm worthless and she's tired of my crap &amp; shove my dog outside (which is the only thing that gives me happiness) we were supposed to go to town and go see a movie (just me and my mom) but my sister tagged along so my mom said we would go to Starbucks and then go to the mall instead which really pissed me off to begin with.

Christmas break ends for my school we go back tomorrow and there is more stress there I've been so pressured to get good grade my mom wants me to go to insanely good schools (Stanford, Duke, Vanderbilt) to name a few and they are good schools for engineering but the stress of keeping grades up is insane I leave school with a headache and a tight chest every day I have to get all A's &amp; B's taking honors and AP classes and if I don't I get punished

I really have nobody else to go to because my sister hates me for god knows why my mom doesn't care I've tried telling her I need help or therapy or something she just blows it off and I can't go to my dad because he passed away when I was 7 years old I just have nowhere else to go and I think it will help to just get this off my chest

Thanks if you read my problems I hope it will help to get this off my chest im just gonna try and get through these next few weeks and try to improve I know these are petty and dumb things to complain about but there has been a ton of stuff building up to this thanks for reading it helps me know someone cares

I don't even remember what it's like to be happy. 

I don't want to be happy. I **want** to be unhappy. That's all I have, the ability to not need the thing that most people want so much, that they dedicate their entire life to get it. I lose that and all I have is a couple ungrateful, unsupportive, incompetent shits for a family(my parents and my little brother, not a family started by me) of whom I have to work overtime to feed(I don't know if that's proper grammar, English is not my native language) and barely functional body for like 20 more years.

Never got any job. I spent last eight years basically 24/7 with either my father or mother. I don't get out without my dad and you know it's enough.

"They're basically all friendly towards me until I talk about my feelings and depression and then they're like ""Oh you're depressed? Bye"" 

it's not even that people just don't want to deal with me, whether its my close friends that I used to open up too. (Found out quickly that they weren't close to me at all because they all left me) The worst part is is that when girls talk about their depression or their anxiety people are like ""Awww do you want someone to talk to, are you okay?""

 But when guys talk about feelings our depression I just can't because I know all they would do is just pay no attention. It's so dumb.

Am I the only one that thinks like this? Because I've never seen any guy open up about their ""depression"" if they had one they usually keep it to themselves. Even after if they've gone through break ups they never really say anything about being depressed but it's ""okay"" if girls are depressed. ",5

"Hey guys, I am 16 and have been depressed for many years, but I started to make some huge progress a few weeks before New years. I started to eat healthy, lost weight, even went out a lot and hung out with some girls that I would have never had the balls to talk to before.

-

For some reason, I became confident, determined, and enthusiastic about life in the blink of an eye. Well that all changed when I woke up to an ambulance arriving at my house and carrying out my mom who had just collapsed. Me and my sister thought it was just a small thing, we did not realize that we would be in for the worst news of our lives when our dad got back from the hospital.

-

My dad arrived home with our grandparents and started crying as he explained to use that our mom had just died from a heart attack. She was only 49 and had no health problems. My whole family broke down crying as I just stood there in shock, I didn't cry, I didn't say a word. I just stood there with disbelief.

-

The second day of the new year, and I've already lost hope, as I'm sure my sister has too. I believe she died because of so much stress that a heart attack was caused, I know that she had been very down lately and I felt very bad for her, but I never said anything to her to explain that I was feeling the same. I feel like if I had just said something, maybe just maybe she would be alive, BUT I DIDN'T. 

-

Not only that, but I never got to say goodbye, I didn't get to hold her hand as she died. I didn't even get to go to the hospital or see her in the morning, I didn't even get to say goodnight the night before. All I can think about is how much I miss her, I just want to hear her voice one more time, go on one more walk with her, something. But I can't.

"So for as long as I can remember I've hated myself, self harmed, had thoughts/plans of suicide. Well about five years ago I started hurting myself via cutting and I was found out and taken to a hospital. And at the time I had a friend who also self harmed but neither one of us knew the other did it. My parents were good friends with the schools principal and he told them this which immediately led to them blaming her for corrupting me basically and no matter how many times I told them this wasn't true they wouldn't listen. So we're in the hospital and my parents told the doctors this and I could tell they immediately took me/my case less serious and after a series of vague question (usually what are your grades, how clean is your room etc ) the doctor told my parents I was faking it for attention. I was put into therapy and starting out I had three therapists but over the course of a year I worked my way down to one. At the end of that year the last one was kicked off of my case. But throughout that year I still self harmed and have off and on ever since. Well now to the point ig, my mum has always told me that she cares/loves me but has done nothing to try and help me (outside of that therapy which she constantly told me was useless) I have gotten caught self harming multiple times but have never been taken to the hospital since the first time, I have told her that I feel suicidal and have been struggling with the urge to not hurt myself and I asked if I could go back to therapy. That was a month ago and she hasn't said anything about it or even asked how I was doing. Then today I slept late because I didnt fall asleep until 7am and she was yelling at me for being lazy then told me that I'm depressed because I'm always sleeping or in my room, and then told someone else that when she didn't know I could hear her. But there have also been times where she gets upset because I dont talk to her about stuff. I'm just wondering if someone can help me understand her thought process because I Have been trying to for years and can't. Also sorry if this is super confusing. Thanks to anyone who try's to help ð",2
"My husband just left to take our dog to the dog park. He tried to get me to go but leaving the house just feels crushing. I was having an okay day. It's always a normal day until something small wedges itself in my brain and turns into the storm of anxiety. We've been married for a little over two months. 

It's time for me to find a job in my new location. I have a degree in Education, but it only took me my last semester to realize how I had made the biggest mistake of my life. When I was in my student teaching, I was teaching seniors (which was bad enough)- but then my mentor teacher bullied me and long story short- I absolutely don't want to teach anymore. I tried my absolute hardest but I guess I wasn't cut out for it. 

The last two years I've been substituting. It hasn't been the worst. It's an easy enough job. But I don't think I should be doing it. I feel like I need a better career. One I am cut out for. Besides, teachers always make fun of the person who claims to be a âprofessional substituteâ. I feel so depressed when I start looking at jobs. It's taxing to try and find something you can do when you don't know what you want to do. Before long into looking, I feel like I'm just going to vomit. Now I'm laying in bed- trying not to cry again and writing this Reddit post. This is such a fun way to go into the new year. Helpless and depressed. 

I don't expect anyone to comment and give me any sort of resolve, but I honestly just needed to vent this out because I'm a pathetic human being.",2

"I'm just laying in bed with tears rolling down after waking up from a long nap. My thoughts are scattered so bear with me. I feel pressure in my chest. I have work deadlines and shit I should have done over the holidays. It was an easy work day though since I left early to get a tooth fixed that I've neglected for more than a decade. I didn't see the point in getting it fixed though - my dentist made me. It's a waste of time and effort on me. I went home after and had a 4 hr nap ... and woke up disoriented in the dark before it hit me that I'm still alive in this life I hate. I always find myself in this place thinking and fantasizing about the end, no matter how my day went. My day could have been amazing and I still ending up thinking about the best way to die.   
I have help- I have a family, a wonderful psychiatrist, a good job. I had a lot of love to give but in the end I just don't want to live. No matter how much people try to convince me, I just don't think I was made for living. I've tried, I've really tried. I exercise and run, I socialize, I work, I spend time with my family. But all I want to do is waste away. I wish I could give my body away to someone who would appreciate it more.

"Happy new year. A time when we both look toward the future and look backwards to the past. My future is a dark plcew, a horrible place of nothing but additional resonsibility, more expecttion, and yt more grief, more dissapointmnt, and more angisih. I feel as though I died many years ago. I am now thirty years old, and yet I attempted suicide in my late teens and early twenties. After theray and drugs, and finding true love, I recovered. But this is not  story of a mistreated hero. I am no antgonist of fiction, striving to overcome hardship. My hardship is of my own doing. My heartache is of my own creation. It is cliche to say that it is because I broke up with a girl. I broke her heart and now she is nothing mre than a distant memory. 

I am 30 now, but I figure I broke up with her about 6 or seven year ago. We were together for six years. I'd love to say I was different then but I'm quite sure I was more or less as I am now. This was the kind of love you find once in a lifetime. I have never communicated with one I felt so in tune with. I have never had someone be so patient with my issues. She forgave all my flaws and yet encouraged me to do better. For a while she made me feel as though I was someone ele. I told her I knew if we ever broke up it would be my fault, but she never believed me. 

I'm writing this now as an older man, supposedly moved on, supposedly mre sccesful. I am supposed to have learned and lived and fund new relationships. Many years ago she forgave me, and yet I feel mre and more grief as the years roll by. 

You see lthough I knew that I was incredibly lucky to have found love with oe such as her, I was totally and inexroably unfaithful. This woman loved me. I know this because she put up wit my flaws, and she taught me lie lessons I still repeat today. She is now with a man, or at least he was th last time we spoke, which was around three years ago. She looked healthy last I saw her, when she was with some new guy called Dave, and I noticed she looked so much healthier than I had ever seen her. She was so much more lifeike, confident, and vibrant than she ever was with me. I don't know if she is still with him. I a't brjng myself to messga eher, although not a minute of my waking life passes that she doesn't cross y mind. I miss her so much. Let me tell you that I miss her so very much. I have never told anyone close to me that I miss her, and even if I did tell any of my close confidants, I know no one from the time in which I know the girl I love, so to them it means very littele. More tan enanything in this world I miss her and I cannot possibly type this enough for it to portray how much I feel it. 

One night, 6 year ago or so, I ucked some other girl. I got drunk with a couple of friends on a randm nght out, lost contrl of my senses and my mind. Another girl, some stranger, some nothing, ws flirting with me, and through a series of terribe decisions I ended up sleeping with her within a couple of hours of meeting er As son as I it was done, I relaised what I had done. I called my ex, I tld her in no uncertain terms what I had done. THt I had cheated on her. I had slept with a stranger. I had been drunk. The scream. The scream of sheer angusih I heard down that phone haint s me even no. I cannot explain to you how much that killed me, istening to hr heart brek. This girl had put up with so much from me. She had gone through so much already and now this. That scream still haints me. She was on her way to the shops to pepare a nie surprise for us both when I told her this. She went back home nd I culd hear in her voice she was crying. I was staring at a wall, a foot away from it. I didn't feel like I was even me. I could hear ahe was crying. WHen she got back to her flat all I caould hear was her scream. She had held it in. She cried out, half echoing the word ""no"", half screaming and then she sobbed. I was whispering that I was so sorry. SHe screamed in the most cutting and now angry way ""Why?!""... ""Why would you?!"" I  just told her I was drunk, mindlessly drunk. SHe told me it was over. I agreed, I didn't blame her at all. I knew exactly what I had done. 

I have never been the same since. Judith has told me she forgives me. Was slept together after  year or so. SHe old me I need to learn to forgive myself. But this was five or o years go. Every day since I hve been a shell. I am not me. I diedd years go. I tried to kill myself before i knew her but never since. I just crrried on. I hate myself and my god, my gs. I have hated myself ever since. I am guilty. I m shameful. I broke dher heart. I am scum. I ha something perfect, and I reuined it. I mss her so much. 
I havehad a lot to drink. I tried to stop drinking sicne I cheated on her, blaming the alcohol But here and there, on nights like tonight, I have still turned to the bottle. I want to kill myself tonight. I hate myself. She is with another man, she is another persn, I am another person, she probably has kids by now. SHe is with me every waking hour and every waking day and my god I just can't forget wht I have done. I went back to university, decided to reinvent mysef and escape my past. But I haven't been happy in years. I cannot overcome this, and I should try to kill mmyself. I'm thinking of getting a lot more drunk and cutting my wrists or my throat. Deep enough that I bleed out in the bath. Even if it doesn't kill me, the act would bring me back to a time I feel more comfortable with. I have been so alone since this happened. THis is not the story of a person dealing with hardship. This is all my fault. I broke her heart. I just can't go on being this peron. I cnnot make sense of my narrative, I cannot make this sotry right. I do not want to break my mother's heart by killing myself. I t destroy her too. But I just can't go on anymore and I don't know what the fuk to do. lease if anyone can say anything that makes me feel remotely better, fuck it even if you just try, please do I will rad all of your messages. Please I just don't know what to do. ",4

 Just got back the results after retaking a test and scored another F. And so I am formally announcing giving up on my education and getting a low-entry job and just being content with that for the rest of my life. I've been depressed for a while now, and self-medicating with alcohol. Somedays just seem to pass on autopilot, I don't even notice the day has passed until I look outside and see it's already dark out.

So I'm back to jobseeking once again, and experiencing incredible anxiety about telling my family about my failure, they've been really supportive of me ""taking life into my own hands"" and striving to do better with my education. Truth be told it was a half-assed attempt and I barely studied at all. Spent my time playing games or wallowing in self pity most of the time.

Yesterday I googled something that vaguely described how I felt and landed on [this page](http://www.getesteem.com/lse-symptoms/symptom-details.html) and it resonated so hard with me I broke down into tears. I feel like a mess.

"**CLIFFS--** Was high on life, having good party times. Let it all get to my head, inflated my ego and created an image I wasn't able to maintain. Was pretending to be someone I wasn't. Had a nervous breakdown, sobering event, and lost all my confidence and now am filled with self loathing as if my life has peaked. Doctors diagnosed me with bipolar manic depression 8ish years ago. I tried some medication but didn't like it. Smoked weed to push my problems aside for many years and now they are coming back almost as strong as ever. I don't know how to get comfortable around my peers anymore. I feel like my facial expressions and personality are completely empty and Im having trouble finding myself. All this is making it really tough for me to open up in relationships, especially ones with females my age. Im 28 and its been 8 years since I've been in an intimate situation with a woman.

The worst part is, I remember how things used to be. How confident and comfortable I was in my own skin. The attraction from girls I liked. I liked who I was. Now, all I can see is some sad lonely man whos trapped inside his own mind and overly self conscious. I cant stop beating myself up about it. When I look in the mirror, all I see is a sadder, older, uglier version of myself without the personality which got me all the girls in the first place",3

"I'm am a 15 year old male who has depression. I been bullied throughout my life, ignored, look down upon, and even laughed at for being stupid. Depression has taken a lot on me and I can't deal with it anymore. People I try to talk to at school just ignore me or talk to my so called friends around me who also ignored me, and it just makes me filled with rage, sadness, and envy. I helped those people in the past and they don't repay me back. I sit alone at lunch, and basically just a loner in general. My family doesn't know I have depression and I don't want to tell them because it will make them sad and I love them.I will probably  kill myself later this year, or during the school year and see how much they care.( Probly won't), but hey, at least I'm passing my classing with a, and b's. All I'm asking for is friendship or just to be happy, or at least an aquatience. I have to go to school in a little but I haven't gone to sleep.

, hahah.  Well finally things are going well, I hope soo. Thank you for the support very much! I do appreciate.",1
"When daydreaming my mind brings up negative memories. In any situation, in any location my mind will simply wander and bring up pessimistic memories instantly. I'll often be left pondering ""why did I do that?"" - ""why did I say that?"". These will often be memories or sort of quick snapshots of uneasy moments in my life that will flash through my psyche as soon as I have a spare moment.

It's happened on the train, when at work and socialising with friends. The odd thing is that the memories vary in date - it could be something I said last week, to something I did at a party when I was like five years old. The underlying factor is that all of these memories will have negative associations and will leave me questioning my actions, thoughts and responses at the time. It seems as though I have no control over what memories or images appear - I have been overheard saying ""How can I even remember that!"" when peculiar or seemingly distant images re-appear.

Does anyone else have any similar experiences with this? And apologies if this is not the correct Reddit for this post.

"I have completely isolated myself since I was 13. Im 18 now. Just stopped talking to the few friends i had. My whole life just fell before my eyes. I thought I was gonna have a good happy life, go to college, have a girlfriend by now and be having kids within a few years. I literally have only one friend. I gave up a long time ago. I forgot what happiness is, and the ability to have a social life. I have a social job but thats it - im so unhappy and hopeless. I feel like i have no options. I really want to have the life I always thought i would. More importantly, I want the motivation to have a normal life. But I dont know how to get it back. Please help me.",4
"i see all the people celebrating, all the big lights, the fireworks, the ornaments, but none of it moves me even just a little. what is new years but just another excuse for all the sheep to get belligerent, numbing themselves from the bigger picture? ""tradition""? fuck that, there's no such thing behind it. christmas and new years are a masterclass in capitalism at work. valentines, easter, halloween, etc. are all crash courses in capitalism, but new years/christmas are the phd. it makes me sick. all these sheep spending all their hard earned loot on things they think they can't live without, which really won't yield anything of substance, only one fleeting moment of feigned happiness. is it worth it? are you so miserable that retail therapy is what you turn to to feel better for one moment? all this shit is a topical anaesthetic, never getting at the meat of it. society is so doomed. 

culture doesn't exist anymore. we're afraid of our history. on this relentless pursuit of creating a unified world we're negating our rich cultural heritages, which can be curated to leave out the negatives.

is sex really the *only* thing that matters in life? it seems it's everyones prime motive. make money. why? so you can attract cheap people who'll fuck you once they know you've got it? money is just another topical anaesthetic. might as well be monopoly money, because none of what it gets you has any real substance. the only reason you want it is so you can quench your insatiable thirst for fucking. anyone who claims sex isn't the core of it all just never got enough of it so lies to themselves, taking a fake moral high ground- fuck you. we're living in an era where plethoras of shit relationships abound. relationships formed not organically, but by way of swiping right on an app on our phones for fucks sake. absolutely repulsive, breading legions of hedonists who later in life will have to hide their pasts from their partners. ""wholesome""? what the fuck is that... a relic of a long defunct past. there's more to relationships than sex-appeal- it's those little idiosyncrasies which make you want someone in the long run; those little quirky things which make them uniquely them, which you'll never get to know just by swiping right. and even for those who don't dabble in this e-fornication, they're doing it all wrong for the most part. a great lasting relationship will only become harder and harder to find moving forward. and even those that exist, a lot of them are founded under false pretences. people are seldom honest, thinking their lies will get them ahead, but they only land you deeper in a hole. be honest with yourselves and with others. 

society today is pathetic. every single person, young or old, glued to their damn 'smart' devices which serve no purpose other than to dumb you down- perfect irony. i'm 28, but am living among hoards of technosheep instead of real humans who thrive off personal contact. it's sickening. everyone living their lives for your viewing pleasure, presenting you perfectly curated renditions of their ideal, which they'll never really have. everything is so shallow, never venturing to go beyond the surface. there might be factions of people who don't adhere to this new way of life, but fuck it, so what? it's only getting worse. 

buy, buy, buy, drink, drink, drink, fuck, fuck, fuck. 

i used to feel like an outsider-- an alien walking around this foreign planet--, but lately i feel like it's the other way around, like all these sheep are prancing around this perfect world and i'm seeing it for what it is.

"I tried to post this on a proof reading sub but it's pretty inactive. 

After a long struggle I recently decided to seek medical help and was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Although i finally have a plan towards recovery and medication as my tool, i chose to seek help after this past semester had ended. 

Due to my mental illness I couldn't do my best academically to get out of my academic probation (a result of failing to seek help earlier than later) and such I'm facing dismissal from my college. All i needed is one more semester to graduate. 

But there is hope :), I chose to appeal the dismissal and had to write a 3 paragraph max explaining the circumstances that affected my academic performance and a plan towards success. 

Here is a link to guidelines and my finished petition: https://drive.google.com/open?id=11g3mmfG5uUOe5wCMQZlUZKpZgzp-HZRf

All i ask is for someone to please proof read the short petition for me. Or offer suggestions. Its due Jan the 9th but I want to finish it and submit it ASAP. 

Thank you!

I am worthless. I am a nerd. I think like a nerd. I act like a nerd. But I'm not as smart as a nerd. I am too poor to collect comics. My brain isn't wired to learn programming. I haven't seen any nerdy shows. My only strength is math. But that's not that nerdy. I have alienated myself. It's too late for me.,2
"For a little while there, things were looking up. I was talking to lots of people at work and in my classes, I was (kind of) making friends. Nothing serious, but it was 10x better than where I was before. I thought that I was finally getting out of this seemingly endless depression that I was in (I've been dealing with it for years now). For the first time in a very long time I felt like I was getting better.

Ha. Right.

Here I am on New Year's, sitting in my room crying and feeling sorry for myself. Probably going to get drunk in a second. Nobody invited me to do anything or even included me in their mass-texted happy new years wishes. There was one person who I thought I was really hitting it off with who I was going to chill with for new years, but he's suddenly not really talking to me and ditched me tonight (*he* suggested hanging out) to go out and do something else (which he also didn't invite me to). I'm not mad at anybody for not inviting me, don't get me wrong I know I'm not entitled to an invite to anything. But shit...why am I even fucking trying? Apparently I'm not worth being friends with. I'm just the last resort when you're so bored at work or school that you'll talk to whoever's around. 

And it's not even like ""oh don't take it personally, everyone has 'work friends' separate from people they actually hang out with all he time."" But even that's not true. Everyone at my job is super close and they hang out all the time in big groups. I was the only one in my tiny department (besides the guys who work in the back and don't really interact with those of us up front) not to get invited to a coworker's wedding.

Sometimes I honestly wonder if I'll ever have friends again. Honestly. That sounds so melodramatic but I can never get past ""acquaintance."" I can't even get people to add me on fucking Facebook. Why bother",1
"Hi, everyone. I thank you in advance for reading this post. 

I feel trapped, I don't know what to do. Today I realized the fact of no longer having a family. My mom has a really rare type of cancer, my dad abandoned us when I was 1 year old, so I don't know anything about him. 

I haven't graduated college yet, I work to sustain myself, pay rent and food, while trying to finish my career and get my degree. But, my extended relatives who used to support me financially (since my mom never did it) insulted me for not spengind New Year's Eve with them. I got to live in another city because of my studies, and I am glad because I don't live with them anymore. 

I didn't do it for the sake of my mental health, I constantly get verbally and physically abused by those relatives and that has been like that since I was born. My aunt even tried to kill me. 
They didn't care about my depression, anxiety or suicide attempts. 
Depression started for me since I was 12, today I am 22. I have battling with disease alone, no meds, got therapy just twice because I couldn't afford more, but still they say I have no right to complain since ""they had horrible childhoods and I didn't have to sell anything on the streets"". 

I am really scared because I am afraid of losing my job and I don't want them to hurt me. I don't know what to do if I lose my job, I don't have close friends and my boyfriend is poor and still lives with his parents 

Any advice or opinion? I need help. Thank you. :) ",4
"Hey everyone, I'm Jake and I'm 23 years old. I'm already started to give on my life now since September and i don't care about my life because its shitty, i have 2 speech impediments, no girls talk go me in school or anywhere, etc. I have so much anxiety and depression that Im losing my mind lately, plus I'm not eating enough and sleeping enough too because i don't feel like eating alot because i feel so upset at just everything in my life. I'm never happy anymore at all and i don't feel like living at times now too because of my problems while other peoples have fun in college, have friends and get married in a few years and have kids ,etc. My cousin just got engaged and most of my cousins are in relationships. I have a Speech Impediment called Verbal Apraxia with Stuttering which i had my whole life since i was born . i only had one relationship for almost 3 years in the past. I have been very depressed lately because i don't have a girlfriend like my twin brother and some cousins and friends that i have. i have good social skills because my nick name is the mayor Jake everywhere i go because i know and talk to everyone but i never talk to girls due to problems listed in this post.

I have some social anxiety too which makes me super scared to talk to girls because of my Verbal Apraxia with the stutter and it makes me very depressed. As i type this I'm having alot of anxiety and I'm about have a panic/anxiety attack too, when i have anxiety i have irrational thoughts like people are out to get me and other things like that . i feel like no girls will like me or give me a chance because of it if i approach them in real life because i can't even say my name correctly. when i talk, it sounds like a moderate deaf person and i hate it so much all of my life. Also i used tinder which my twin brother met his girlfriend on and have no luck even after many dates with different girls, now i am getting more depressed to the point of crying and not going out of the house too at times. My family is not the greatest at times too.I live with my mom and grandmother who makes everyone crazy which includes me. Every girl i talk to on tinder stop talking to me within a few replies too so i don't have idea what to do now too like what am i doing wrong? but my friend said i suck talking to girls too so im trying to improve that right now.

Lately I'm thinking I'm ugly too which i kinda believe that i am ugly because no girls like me while my family and other people says I'm not ugly. also I'm in community college so I'm missing the college experience of staying on campus making friends and meeting girls like everyone else is at my age because of my grades and possibly future degree in funeral directing. I am at home doing the online program for funeral directing while  All my cousins and my brother and everyone at my age  went away to college and im home missing out on everything when you stay at college like meeting girls and parties Also i live at home too that doesn't help me in meeting girls unlike everyone at college campuses. Im too scared to approach any girls because of my speech problems because I'm afraid of them not understanding me. i just can't do it due to anxiety because of my speech impediments and afraid of getting rejected. Also some of my anxiety is from school too because I'm very behind in my classes as of today because I have no motivation to do it because of how i feel sick almost all the time from all of my anxiety and depression too. Also due to all of this, i just got a new gym membership to go with my guy friends and i used it a couple times then i stopped going with them because i feel like my speech impediments make me awkward around girls and people . all my life i felt like people say things to pretend so i think they understand me sometimes. I only have 3-10 male friends while every other guy have female friends and stuff at my age. I don't know where to start or what to do at this point in time because i tried Tinder and that didn't worked for me. Plus when i message girls on tinder, they almost never respond back. i can talk to guys easily and other people easily but not attractive girls at all , let alone approaching girl to get their numbers.i can see myself being forever alone because of my speech impediments.Also i have been in speech therapy too for a long time when i was little and I'm not in it now. So i need help and advice right now from my fellow Redditors Thanks for your help and advice everyone !

tl;dr:i have Verbal Apraxia with stuttering which are speech impediments and i can't talk to girls due to the fear of not being understood and rejected of my speech impediments. Im scared of being forever alone while my friends and everyone is married and have kids in a few years while I'm not. To be honest, I'm almost 100% sure most girls will not date me because of my speech impediments and have a family. . What should i do at this point in time? Also should i try to approach and talk to girls that i like ? Because i want to over come this fear of talking to girls because i think they will not like me of my speech impediment.

Edit- I'm getting  regular therapy weekly  now, also I'm seeing the same therapist that I saw years ago when I was younger too and im going to the gym too now. I made a  tinder account too this week but almost every girl that i talk to stops talking to me or never respond to my first message. Im not in speech class right now i had it when i was little tho.",4

That made me depressed. I thought I had it all figured but, then I realised that I don't really know anymore if I want to become a doctor.

I really don't know that much about myself, but I know that I can't be bothered to work over hours. I like to make songs, and sing, and edit videos, but I really don't know what career to take from those, especially since I have already started a level with those subjects. I was thinking of giving YouTube a go, but my parents most likely won't approve at all.

"At night, my mind is never more active.

It's 10:30 pm 

I lay down. Tired. Exhausted. I have the intention of sleeping. 

My mind has other ideas. I start thinking about dying. I think about the possibility of my grandmother dying or my mom. I start panicking. I toss and turn. 

It's 12 am.

I start worrying about when my heart will give out. What happens after we die? Is there a better life ahead? How does it feel to have the life sucked out of you? 

The realization of my dead childhood dog of 15 years hits me. My heart starts to hurt. I regret not being next to her as she was put down. She must hate me. She must have been in so much pain. Alone. Scared. I should have been there. I'm such a coward. 

What time is it? Every position is so uncomfortable.. I'm so tired though.. I want to sleep.. 

Why can't I sleep. Why does my mind have to think like this. I don't want to be like this. 


I have so much trouble sleeping. Last night I tosssed and turned for about 3 hours before I could finally fall asleep just to wake up at 7 am because my parents don't deem it healthy to wake up any later.

"I created a throwaway just to tell my story. I'm not sure what else to do at this point. I'm so upset I can't eat, can't sleep, can't do anything productive, and have nowhere to vent my frustration and no one to vent it to. 

Start with a little about me. I'm a 38 year old female. I've been suffering from clinical depression and anxiety for many years now. I've tried treatment, but that only makes me more listless and tired, so I'm really trying to self medicate with vitamins and exercise, but that doesn't always do the trick. My first thought every morning when I wake up is to put a bullet through my brain. Thankfully, I don't own a gun, and probably don't have the balls to do it, but nonetheless, that is my first thought every single morning. But every day I drag out of bed and continue to live, except for on my days off, in which I rarely make it out of bed, and if I do, it's just to drink for awhile.

Now a little back story with what I am dealing with tonight. I fell in love at first sight about 25 years ago. Many things happened that made a relationship impossible, and we never acted on our feelings until about 8 years ago. At that time, he had a girlfriend. He left her for me, but due to sticky circumstances we never officially got together (aka living together, etc.) We did spend a really great few years spending almost every day together, travelling a lot and falling in love, or so I thought. Things came to a head after a while, it was a âforbiddenâ relationship from the start due to the aforementioned sticky circumstances. 

About 5 years ago, he met someone else and fell in love with her. She is a very possessive, controlling, manipulative type. She's gotten his head so twisted up, there have been times he has wanted to commit suicide, and comes to me. He went almost a year in the relationship without telling me at all. Once I found out, he continued to break up with her (or her with him) every few months for a week or so and would spend it with me, just to go back to her and drop me like I was nothing. She is a horrible person. From the very beginning I tried to be cordial with her, because I never blame âthe other womanâ when a man cheats. But she treated me like âthe other womanâ from the start, even though we were together first.  As a matter of fact, her first words to me ever were to taunt me saying she âhas my man all the timeâ. At one point during one of his suicidal episodes, I sat right next to him as he texted her saying he wanted to kill himself, and her response to him was âDo itâ.

The last year or so, the break ups have waned, and we honestly have not seen or talked much at all. Our split broke my heart, and I was really just starting to get over it, starting to âlearn to live half a lifeâ like the song goes.  
Two months ago, he called me and asked me to take some time off over the holidays because she was going out of town and he wanted to spend a few days together. At first I was reluctant, because in the past we only ever did this when they were broken up. But I agreed because I just miss him so much, I can't even describe it. I knew I had to end it, but my plan was to spend a last few days in happiness with him then to tell him to let me go. Let things end on that note, give me some closure at least. 

So I took some time off. He called me a few weeks later to tell me he had the dates wrong, and I even went so far as to change my vacation time (even though my boss is not open at all to that sort of thing). I got new tires, got the car serviced so we could take a trip. It's really been the only thing keeping me going the last few weeks, knowing that I was going to be happy for a few days. 

Well, the time comes to take the trip. He calls me the night before, telling me he will call me when he wakes up and we can leave. The next morning, I'm packed, just waiting for his call, could not even sleep the night before because I was so excited. 

That was yesterday morning. I still have not heard a word from him. I finally called his phone tonight and another man answered, saying he was him. Of course I recognized the voice and knew it wasn't him. The man asked me who I was and when I told him my name he said I have the wrong number and hung up. I have sent him a couple of messages with no reply.

So here I sit now wondering how I let myself fall for this, how I let myself go so far out of my way and get my hopes up so much just to be crushed. Again. I wonder if he did all this intentionally just to hurt me, or if something came up, maybe she came home early. I know I have no right to be upset because it was I who was planning on running away with another woman's man, but I am still upset. Devastated. So let down I don't know what to do with myself.

I know whatever the outcome, a day from now I will be in the same situation I would have been anyways. I would have ended it for good, and still will, but I guess I had in my mind how that was going to go, and this is not what I had planned. 

I just need to know how to get this weight off my chest, this lump out of my throat, how to force myself to eat or even get out of bed (except to drink which makes it worse). I thought about using the rest of my vacation doing something productive, but I seriously cannot even. I just don't understand why he would do this to me. I never asked for this, he planned it all, just to let me down again. And for what? And I can't even yell at him, because he won't speak to me. Half of me just wants to tell her everything just to get revenge, just to hurt him too. But I know that will only make me feel worse. 

I wonder what I ever did to be treated like this. I wonder how I can keep living. I was in a very bad mental state before this, and I'm afraid this might just put me over the edge. I guess I just needed someone to hear my story. So here it is.

" I'm 20 and I feel like I'm not going to get anywhere in life. I've been struggling with depression for three years now and my life has not moved forward. I'm stuck at home doing absolutely nothing. I know that I'm not a dumb person and that if I try I'll be able to do it. I know what I should be doing but can't/don't, I'm not a child anymore and my family won't support me forever. It hurts to watch everyone who believed in me and all of the people and friends in my life move on ahead while I feel stuck. I want to do what other people my age are doing. I want to build a future for myself where instead of being a burden I can instead help my family. I want to reach a place where I can do what I want without being held back. I feel like a phony and a big disappointment to everyone I meet and to myself. I know that I have so much potential but I can't. I can't and I don't know why. Am I just afraid to grow up ?

"Maybe this will help someone or help me. I'm not quite sure. I'm a 24 m with three kids. I'm going to back up and let everyone understand.

  When I was about 1 year old my father obtained full custody of me. I rarely seen my mother. Once in elementary school she came around once a month. My dad was always hauling me around. Pretty much raised me just fine as a single father. He got married when I was 12 and she's an alcoholic who is also a feminist. She was just that, a person married to my father. About 16 years old, towards the end I ended up getting a girl I'd been in a relationship with for a year pregnant. I attempted suicide as all I have done in my life is alcohol and drugs. Very foolish and ignorant and didn't understand life. (I get it, selfish or whatever roast me later.) 
  We split because she had a very dark personality. She eventually got addicted to heroin. Which leads to my next venture at 18-20. I met a girl who was supposed to be a one night stand. I'd have barely held a job and was completely irresponsible. We had shared parenting of my oldest son. I was also in school and decided I wanted to be a firefighter. I took my EMT class and got a job working on an ambulance. She accidentally got pregnant with me because of a failed nuvaring.She was very controlling of me and which I hated the feeling of being controlled. As I had been a free spirit for pretty my entire life. I was staying at home by myself since I was about 6 years old.
  I ended up cheating on her when he was about 8 months old.Ew ah, bad guy. Immaturity at its complete and utter finest.  Understood. But wait there is more! I woke up late for work which I should've been there at 4 a.m after I got home at around midnight from college classes. I lost my job and ended up failing my paramedic class by about .5% which meant I couldn't go forward. So, I dropped out of college and lost my job. My parents let me move back in with them. I worked at papa johns just for a little money. Then came the first child support order. 
  Making barely 500$ every two weeks as a manager they decided to hit me as hard as they could with $200 a month. Not too bad but I couldn't afford to live on my own. *queue sappy music* I decided to get back into working on the ambulance. I was disgusted of not making enough to live on my own. I took out about 20k student loans as well to buy the ex and nice 4.5k explorer. As well made sure we had everything we needed. As well as a car for me! Debt debt debt. I made less money working on the ambulance coming in at a whopping 8.57$ an hour. I worked about 80-120 hours a week. Straight 24's day after day. I found different girls to be with because I still couldn't afford to live because I only made around 1,200$ a month. We then found out my ex was addicted to heroin. We had shared parenting so the only way to remove the order without lawyer fees was to give my parents temporary custody.
  Alright, so at this point you're probably like damn it can't get that bad. As Billie mays says, âbut wait there's more!!â Oh boy I reflect on life a bunch. I accrued 3 credit cards which are completely maxed. Heheheh. So on the with story, I met a few different girls and they all had decent jobs which let me have my own place to stay. (Crowd yells:gold digger!!) It was at this time I decided the current girl was not cutting what I needed. Boom, break up with her, at the same time I found a new ambulance job which gave me a 1.50ish raise. He'll yeah. So at this point I don't have any custody of my 2 kids and my parents were so gracious to take a child support order on me. (Since I'm making money, ya know 8.57$ an hour.) broke up with her and 3 weeks later she calls me to tell me she's pregnant.(oh god dude you haven't learned your lesson.) ((I'm 23 at this time.)) 

  I said I have nothing with my first two kids and barely see them. I work for nothing and I think the best option would be abortion or adoption. Around the same time I got that new job guess what? Child support claimed I made 15$ an hour and raised my child support to all intensive purposes to about 485$. My other order was recalculated at 8.57$ less than two weeks later as well saying the first order was at 200$. So the girl hits me with the, literally, fuck you pay me.

  That's nice. I said screw it major life change. I need it, something. I found my girlfriend through a friend on Xbox live, what're the freaking odds? I worked on an ambulance but they would've taken half of every check which made the 15$ a day render pointless as I'd only be making enough to go back and forth to work. Well, of course I get a massive 315$ order. We're up to 1100$ ish a month on barely above minimum wage. Now, did contracting work for my dad because I couldn't make any money no matter what to pay bills. Hey, arrears!! You said fuck your kids so we're going to fuck you!! Oh.. is that what happened.. I found a blessing of a job making 18$ an hour. Not doing my career because I cannot afford it. I've been working overtime since 18. Practically killing myself to make ends meet. I am now forced to work on the road. I have to work overtime if I want to pay bills and eat food. Even then I still don't make enough. I haven't paid any debt off. I'm about 28 grand in debt. I've had both my 2 kids taken from me. I didn't have a car for 6 months so I had to borrow my dads truck which he took back. My co-worker sold me a car for 500$. Good guy. 

  Now we're here. Today, almost the start of a new year. Everything, anything, I've ever cared about has been taken from me. My kids. My career. My money. My life. My girlfriend gets mad at me because I can be insecure. What she doesn't see is I'm holding on.. I'm afraid to lose anything else.. not afraid.. I've lost motivation. I've found god. I've gained motivation. Spurts. I'm strong. I have to be. At 24 I act like I'm 45. Maybe 55 because I'm tired. I work 40 hours of overtime 7 am-11pm of hard labor when there is work. Most of the time there is not. So average of 40 hours. If I get a second job I'll get jumped by child support. Already happened. Seen a counselor to try getting prescribed adderall because my body is falling apart. My mind is blank. My thought process is almost gone. I can barely do the dishes correctly. My mother has taken herself away from me. My children have been taken away. He said I'm strong not depressed. I can't even afford healthcare. I make too much as a âsingle guyâ to get Medicaid or the food card. I can't get legal aid. I owe tax money too because I claim 2 for 1 person. They are trying to take my tax return that doesn't exist either. 

Sigh, just wanted to vent. Happy New Years.",3
Can anyone post success stories about them or their friends getting out of depression and did well for themselves?,0
"I love my man. He loves me. We've been together way longer than I anticipated. 

I'm going through a rough patch. Anxiety keeps me awake at night - what if somebody murders me tonight or what if my friend dies or what if I crash my mum's car tomorrow? I can't sleep. 

I love my man and he loves me more than I love myself. I first tried to commit suicide when I was 13. My parents have been tiptoeing around me ever since, asking whether I'm 'fine' every other day.

Ignoring his messages, flirting, acting like a dickhead. I don't deserve him or the love he has for me. I am ruining the only relationship I have ever been happy in. How do I stop?

I love my man. He loves me. I don't know how to tell him I have another lover. My nights are sweaty and sticky and full of screaming - nightmares. I'm cheating on my happiness with darkness and it feels so good. 

I love my anxiety and it loves me.

"I was doing fine for some time and I thought that I could start 2018 with a better outlook, but yesterday I got into a car accident and my car got towed. It's my fourth accident but my first time that I was at fault. I have a speeding ticket too that I need to go to court for in a few weeks.

When I got home, my parents yelled at me. I went into my room at 5pm and didn't get out for dinner (hadn't eaten breakfast or lunch either). I was lying there for some time, thinking about all the mistakes I've made in the last few years. Getting an F in a class, spilling water on my laptop, cracking the screen on my phone 5 times, opening up a credit card and putting myself in $2500 debt, getting an STD after having sex with a guy who was in a relationship, drinking even though it's forbidden in religion. I have also been fighting depression since last August, because I started a graduate program with no social support and all my college friends moved away. I had an appendectomy in September. I was applying to medical schools; the application process was anxiety filled and one of the scariest things I've had to go through. I got rejected by most schools and waitlisted by a few.

While lying in bed, thinking about all of the shitty things I've done in my lifetime, I remembered I have a hook that's in the corner of my room. I had asked for the hook a few years ago so that I could get an indoor hanging chair or hanging pottery but never got around to it. I also have a chair in my room. For a good hour, I seriously thought about hanging myself. Why should I continue to live if I just keep making mistakes over and over again, and disappoint my parents constantly? Why should I bother to see this year through, when it's already off to such a shitty start?

Right now, it's 3am and i'm doing a little better after sleeping it off. I got out of bed, made myself some food, and eating Ben n Jerry's to numb the pain. I'm reminding myself that a new year is NOT a clean slate, and that I won't magically become a better person or magically stop being depressed. I need to put the work and effort into bettering my life. 

I'm going to journal this year and start going to my university's counseling services next week.",2
"All I want is to die. I want to end this endless pain. Every moment is torture. Every day I come here with no response from her. Not even a look.
Every day she ignores me and for good reason. Because I'm ugly. Because I'm stupid. Because nobody has ever liked me and nobody ever will. Because there are thousands of guys she'd rather be with than me. Because I'm nothing to her. Because I literally disgust her or I'm not even a flinching thought in her mind. Because I'm not worth the thought. I'm not worth anything. I should have killed myself a long time ago. I should go home and take pills, binge wine, and let myself fall into a sleep that I can't wake up from. Then the world can be rid of me. Which is all they ever really wanted.
I'm a virgin. A 32 year old virgin. I feel ashamed. I feel like I don't belong anywhere and that no one wants me. I feel broken. I feel like I should have never been born or I should have died.
I've only had one âgirlfriendâ that lasted about a week. Then as soon as I mentioned I had anxiety and that I was a virgin, she dumped me. She realized how broken I was and ran for the hills. She did the right thing. I am broken. I don't deserve her. I don't deserve anyone. I just deserve to die. This whole life is a mistake. This whole life is a waste. I'm sorry to everyone who knows me for my existence. I'm sorry I'm here. I don't want to be. I promise I won't be very long.
I want to end it. I can't stand another day of this life. I can't take any more of this torture and suffering. Nobody cares. They don't. You don't care. They don't care. I don't care. I'm done. I'm done living in a world that doesn't care. A world that watches suffering unflinchingly and simply smiles and goes about their days not wanting to be bothered with things that are unpleasant.
I'm tired of waiting for nothing. I feel like I'm walking an endless road to nowhere. I just keep getting further and further away from what I once considered normalcy with every step I take.
God I've been fucked over so many times in my life. It feels like, if there is a God, He or She is hellbent on repeatedly torturing me by lifting me up with glimmers of hope before smashing me back down with crushing disappointment. This is the story of my life.
I want to die. I deserve everything bad because I'm worthless. I just want it all to end now. Please let me die. Let an earthquake hit and the ground swallows me up. Let some asshole smash into my car in an intersection. Let me drown in an ocean. Just let it happen. I don't want to be here any more.",4
"When I look at everyone around me, they all seem happy and motivated to live out their lives at least to some degree. They look like they have passions, and interests and things to live for. 

I can't seem to find any of these things for myself anymore. Everything feels so mundane. Pointless. I work and work and work and then I get this tax return that's lessens as I work harder. And for what? To build this life over my span of consciousness just to have it all disappear and mean nothing when I die? 

Life is painful. I feel like I have to fake emotions and reactions to things just to get through the day looking ""normal"" to everyone around me. This inescapable feeling of hopelessness just won't go away. No matter what I do. I try and change something and it still hangs over me. 

I feel like no one will understand the way I feel. I can't even fully understand it, let alone put it into words. I can't even bring myself to end it all because I think of how much it would hurt the only family I still have left. Everytime I've come close to ending my life, my mind floods with images of my sister finding my body and just breaking down. I can't bare to make her or my brother live with the pain of another dead family member after also losing our mom and dad.",5
What else is there to say at this point,5
"I have never been diagnosed with depression or even talked to a professional about it being a possibility.
But I used to think about it a lot. Especially during the last several years of my previous relationship.
I felt like the worst human being because my SO was actually a wonderful person, but I couldn't bring myself to feel happy. Instead, I felt trapped. I often thought I would eventually have to consider suicide if I wanted to get out of it, but I didn't need to worry because I wasn't at that stage yet. I just cried a lot. I also grew to find self harm theraputic, but knew I wouldn't do anything 'too far'. When I did end that relationship, I did an emotional 180, which let me justify and blame all those feelings on the relationship. And up until now I believed that.

I have been in my current relationship for a little less than a year and I am just starting to feel myself sink. But this time it has nothing to do with my SO. In fact, I'm terrified because I'm so invested in them and I don't want them to see me this way. I'm scared of losing them because all I can do is sit around and be a pathetic mop of a person.
I know how good my life is right now so I don't want to do anything to damage it.
I don't have anyone that I am comfortable opening up to with my emotional stuff.
I don't know if anyone can help me try to get my head in the right place, but I would really appreciate any suggestions on how to take control of my own feelings.

"I've created a throwaway-account because the one person that knows my reddit account is my brother and I don't want him to find out about my mental state. First of all, sorry for my grammar being off, I'm trying my best but cirumstances (being a drunk german) make it kinda hard.

So I'm sitting here at 5 AM, drinking whisky and feeling like I've hit an all time low. I honestly don't even know what I'm trying to accomplish by writing this, perhaps.. I don't know.. I want to tell people how miserable I am but I don't want them to pity me.

I'm a 19 years old guy, who is lonely because of social anxiety. I do have a few good friends and I am very grateful for them, otherwise I would probably just colapse.

I've began studying informatics at my local university, it's my first year. I've decided to move out of my parent's house, which I'm kind of proud of. However, I'm unmotivated as fuck. I basically don't go to lectures, I literally spend days in my bed (I'm not kidding, sometimes I just don't eat because.. I don't why honestly, I just dont feel like getting up). I don't really socialize, I just imagine how fun it could be. I wish I had the balls to do it. I wish I just could go out there and show them, that I'm not that fucked up. But I am. I really am.

I could write about my problems for ever, because there are a lot more. But I feel like no one cares anyway, I mean why would you care about it. I hate myself for writing this. I hate myself for everything I stand for. And I don't know how to fix myself

Sorry if this doesn't make sense, if it doesn't: downvote and move on. As I said, I don't know why I wrote this, I never told anyone about it, felt like I needed to get it of my chest.

"Hey everyone! Quick little backstory: I am 22 years old and have suffered from depression since I was around age 14. During that time I took Zoloft with a Xanax PRN for panic attacks. Earlier this year (around May 2017) my primary doctor upped my dosage by 50mg, I was then taking 150mg. My body adjusted to the increase and I hated how it made me feel. I felt worse than before. As if it worsened my symptoms. So, full well knowing the dangers of stopping a medication like Zoloft, I stopped taking it around the end of July 2017. 

At first I was fine. Them a month had gone by and I was bad. Then a few months later (Nov 2017) I was the worst I had ever been in my life. I lost 20lbs from Thanksgiving to now... I don't have an appetite, even though I feel hungry all the time. I have extreme fatigue. I am always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I am stressed because student loans kick in this month ($515 a month), and I cannot afford to visit my family doctor because of $ I owe from previous visits. 

Is this 20lb sudden weight loss something that can be attributed to depression? I am generally a very healthy person. I workout daily, but haven't been able to the past month because of my extreme fatigue and depression. That's why it confuses me as to why I've lost weight. 

I am 22, female, athletic build, 6'0"" and 178lbs.

"Hi there this is my first post. I'm on a throwaway just because people who know me know my reddit. I'd also like to say my family knows about this and I'm currently in CBT which has helped in some ways, but not in others. I'm also on an antidepressant.


I'm 28. My *entire* life I was always happy, laid back, protective, loved animals and especially dogs with all my soul, loved my spouse of 8 years and naturally looked past their flaws, never felt violent or unstable in the slightest. I was connected to everything I cared about. I spent a few years frustrated and depressed but I still felt love, kindness and interest.



6 months ago I had a total and complete mental breakdown. I experienced a violent thought followed by 10 minutes of visceral fear, confusion and fury. I was scared I'd hurt my dog. I didn't want my spouse to come home incase I hurt them. for 2 months I had the belief I was secretly some kind of murderer and was afraid to be around either of them alone. Since then I've retained a resentment and almost hatred toward my spouse and I feel insanely uncomfortable around dogs, and my dog specifically. I harbor this belief that I am evil and I spend all day either furious, repulsed or annoyed by my spouse. I also feel completely disconnected from everything I loved: music, hiking, landscapes, art, books, sci-fi and fantasy.. it all feels distant and alien and something I shouldn't be engaging in. I spent 4 months crying every day and now cry maybe twice a week, just because I'm so keenly aware this isn't who I am and I hate it. 



I was known for being almost too laid back before this. No problems with anxiety or anger. I am so confused and hurt and all day my chest is tight and my mind is racing trying to find answers. I almost have a fantasy of leaving my spouse and today I had a horrible thought of 'if they died I might be way better off'. I tried to brush it off as a silly escapism thought (as in CBT) but the very existence of it made me want to kill myself. I actually felt like I wanted it. 7 months ago I couldn't imagine a life without my family, now I feel like a prisoner to them, and they're so damn supportive, because my spouse knows this isn't me. I'm just scared it is now.


I've been told it's OCD, but I think a lot of it may be depression as well. I don't know what to do really. I mean I know I should wait and get better before making any decisions about anything, but I feel so angry and stressed and I'm starting to snap and be really snarky to my spouse. It's driving me insane.



Can anyone help with some advice, or similar situations, or anything? This is kind of just a cry for help of any kind whatsoever. I'm getting better at dealing with it but it still feels like a railroad spike in my chest and a demon in my head. I feel so bad and evil, and it feels like any good thing I do is forced because I feel like doing the opposite. It's hell.",3
it hurts so bad... i dont want to die but my mind says no,0
"I just got to thinking about how much time I spend alone. Throughout elementary and middle school I had some friends that I hung out with. I lost them all when I went to high school, where I was forced to make new friends. None of those friendships stuck though, and I never hung out with any of the people I talked to. Imagine that: four years of going to school and coming home and spending all that time by yourself. I got to wondering tonight what that does to a person's psyche... I like to think I introspect a lot and I'm a thoughtful person because of it, but I think the more likely outcome of all this is that i've become socially awkward, paranoid, and bitter towards the people around me. I'm like a social and societal disease. Every room I walk into it's like I'm sucking all the energy from everyone there. It's like that in college too. I just started last semester and I've made no friends. i know people in my dorm or in my classes think of me as as that girl with no friends. They either pity me or ignore me like the plague. Sorry for the weird rant. Just wondering if anyone else feels like this...",1
"I'm not really expecting sympathy as I know what I did was wrong.  Note, this is going to be long lol.

So basically I've been seeing this guy online for three months now and we instantly hit it off.  We were texting each other constantly everyday but little did he know that I was actually a catfish who posed as a pretty cute person who was just camera shy.  This was my first time catfishing and instantly after a day of doing it I deleted my account from the dating site but kept in contact with him without telling him who I was.  

Now, this ""relationship"" lasted through November and December which were both of our exam months which gave me the perfect excuse to why I couldn't meet him since we both live in the same area.  He was the perfect guy to me, we shared stories, our feelings, and talked about what we did on that day.  He was everything that I wanted to be; he was sporty, popular, and talented.  What made me fall for him though was that he was so supportive during my exams were he would actually take his time for a couple hours and tutor me.

Over time I just stopped sending him photos and he didn't care he thought I was just shy, but in reality my guilt was just building up.  I wanted to tell him badly but before I did I sought help on subreddits such as r/amiugly and others to get a sense of how I looked.  Obviously, this was a major mistake on my part and resulted in a major blow in my confidence levels.  I was a wreak, and still am.

I told him I was a catfish 3 days ago and to my surprise he took it really well and forgave me really well, he actually complimented me on how I was such a good catfish.  To my surprise he confessed that he also catfishes other people, but instead he catfishes people for fun.  This was going great.  **Until** he confessed that he had a boyfriend all a long and he was pretty promiscuous; but this thought never would have crossed my mind.  I showed him my real photos and he rated me a a 5.5/10.  I was completely average to him, I was ""not too bad"".  He wanted to remain friends and so I did. 

The consequences?  Honestly, I think I've been let off easier than most people but a part of me wishes he just totally broke ties with me.  This was my first relationship that felt meaningful with a person.  Looking at his pictures kills me inside and I haven't talked to him for 2 days now.  I feel empty and alone.  The nightly ritual that we once had of talking from 11 pm to 4 am was gone.  I don't know what to do; this catfishing scheme only resulted in many many insecurities.  I think I've fallen into depression; I feel lonely, jealous of his life, ugly, inadequate.  On top of this is other things like my joblessness.  I find myself comparing my life with his, he was everything I wanted to be.  I'm not sure if I should even still talk to him.  I find myself thinking about him every minute of my day.  I know I can never compete with his boyfriend, he is un reachable now.

This will be my first and last time catfishing.  I'm not sure if this is the effects of losing a friend, having my first ""breakup"", being called extremely average, or both.  Thanks for reading my rant if you're still here lol.  If you're the one I catfished, sorry again... I really wish to talk like we used to.  This is a horrible way to celebrate the new year... a part of me wishes that I had confessed after my Christmas break to remain happy just a little longer...

Ps.  For those who are confused, I'm a guy too.

**TL;DR** I catfished another guy, fell in love after he supported me for so long.  I confessed; found out he had a boyfriend all a long and that he thinks I'm average af.  I'm depressed now after my first breakup because I miss him and never can get him.",4

"I'm jealous of all of my friends who are able to go outside and go to school like it's nothing. For me school just ends up making me feel bad, I get the worst test scores in my class (I got a 39 in Algebra). I even suck at the subjects I should be good at. No one in my family is doing anything to help me, I just want to drop out, but I can't because I want to make them happy. I don't even know what I'd work as if I dropped out, but I'm on that road anyway seeing as I haven't been going to school. Why is going to school so easy for people that aren't like me? It's so annoying to have no one to relate to and I have no one to ask for help. I'm just getting really tired of staying home and doing nothing. One of my friends who I was close with just talks about how good she's doing in school around me, telling me how she's to of her class and 20th in the school's top students.

"I need help. My mom said that I used to be happy, just for the sake of being happy. I can't even remember when that was.

My mother is annoyed to no end by this. I don't want to do the same to my friends. As stated in the title, I have lost the will to live. The timing couldn't be worse, as I'm about to start talking classes for my GED, which I will need to talk because I fucked up in high school by being lazy and not doing my homework. I don't necessarily want to commit suicide, but I feel as though I am ""at peace"". I don't care if I'm going to die anymore. Maybe at most I'll shed a tear and ask to say goodbye. But, I am not at peace, for if I were, I wouldn't have such feelings of my own insecurities and self loathing. I don't know what to do to feel better, as every time I am even the slightest bit happy, it always goes away too soon, and I miss that feeling greatly. The biggest worry right now, is my borderline nihilism, the possibility that nothing matters; there is no point. I am unsure at best about whether or not this philosophy is true. I hope dearly that it's not.",2

I've struggled between keeping myself entertained, keeping my depression at bay, and balancing my anxiety with my attempts at socialization. But I feel like no matter what I do, I always end up feeling alone. 
I used to be parts of groups, used to make friends in school, used to have things to do outside the house. But now I feel like I'm going through the motions of each day and not taking anything away from them. 
The worst part is feeling alone when I'm surrounded by people. I was out just two days ago and almost immediately wanted to head home. I've always considered myself an extrovert but lately I've found it hard to connect with people. Even in my own home, where I have a few roommates, I feel like nothing I do to interact with them is ever enough. One of them is obsessed with his video games, one is barely ever home, and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that I always feel like I'm bothering her when I try to hang out. And now the icing on the cake is last minute cancelation of our New Years plans (for valid reasons), but then instead of the four of us watching the ball drop together, everyone went to bed early leaving me yet again alone. Now I'm ringing in the New Year crying and writing this down, hoping if I make sense of my crippling loneliness, then there's hope in 2017 I can do something about it. ",5
"Early September to early December, for lack of a better description, was a never ending hell for me. Failed all my classes, withdrew from a lot of friends, neglected all my responsibilities, and abused drugs heavily.

In December, I had a stint of self harm, suicidal thoughts, and crazy self destructive behavior that really made me start to think about the bigger picture. I always dismissed my depression, because I thought I was a ""pussy"" for not even being able to feed myself or accomplish anything more than smoking pot, popping benzos and playing call of duty during the day.

But deep down, I knew I wasn't a ""pussy""/loser/failure. And neither are you. I know it's unbelievably hard/impossible to disconnect from that negativity when you're deep in the hole, so I won't tell you to push through it. Because that isn't how depression works, you can't just will yourself to get over it.

What you can do, however, is be honest with yourself. You have depression. It is not something you can shrug off or will away, and it's become a centerpiece of your thought process everyday. 

BUT, you can remember a certain point in your life where you felt happy/content in a natural way. Was it drinking a cup of coffee, and watching the sun rise? Walking around in the woods with headphones on? A good lift in the gym? Being in the company of a good friend? This won't come easy. I've found it helps to write these things down, because your depressed brain will make happy recall very, very hard. Definitely try it out a few times if it doesn't work at first, over the span of multiple days/weeks. This is a process, not a quick fix. 

Now compare those memories to your current day-to-day routine. Me personally, I realized that my college depression was eating me alive, because I didn't have a routine. In high school, I was forced to do the same thing every day. As much as I hated it, I was achieving SOMETHING 5 days of the week. Going to classes, having to get dressed, made a huge difference in my life. Once I moved out and had freedom to do anything, I ironically did NOTHING every day. And that's when I realized really what the root of my issue was. Without accomplishing something productive on a day to day basis, my reward centers slowly started to fade away.

So I forced myself to wake up at 7AM every day, and walk around in the morning for 5 minutes. It was so fucking hard. I completely failed to do it for about a month, then got lucky one day and woke up feeling okay. Managed to accomplish those two tasks. Whoa! That wasn't so bad. I also had to cut out drug use from my life, because pot, benzos, and amphetamines were making it impossible to wake up in the morning.

Granted, I am nowhere close to being out of the woods. If I were to slip into drug use and disregarding my routine every day, I would fall back exactly to where I started. BUT, once you start to feel better, and REALLY internalize the negative effects depression has on your well-being, you can start to be much more proactive about your recovery. I honestly believe the biggest mistake all of us make when we start to feel better, is to disconnect ourselves with how we felt while depressed. It's not something you can leave behind and go back to your old ways. 

Not exactly sure how helpful all of that was, but I hope someone finds it beneficial. 

And for those reading who are currently deep in the hole, just start to introspect. A lot. Write things down. Post on here. Be creative. Hell, even talk out loud if it helps. When depression really, really kicks you to the ground, it has to be the #1 focus in your life. 

And, of course, feel free to reach out to me if you all ever need anything. Everyone deserves to feel content, fulfilled, and happy. Yes, you. I know it doesn't seem like it, but life is worth living &lt;3

"My family loves me. I'm only 17. I have a couple of close friends. I'm not broke, my house has heat, I have a Nintendo Switch. I laugh... 

I was fine until I saw this girl. ""Speak to her."" Hah! Thanks, but it's never so easy. She's plagued my mind, she's all I think about. She's destroying my mind and she doesn't even know me.

I see her every single day. All I do is dwell. Dwell she's not mine. It's my own fault. I'm the one who stays quiet. Well, she does too, of course, but I think you catch my drift.

I was fine. Now I'm not. I'm literally losing my fucking mind. Abusing disgusting amounts of various vile medications provided by my father's prescriptions. I've noticed a difference in my brain since I've touched those pills. I'm actually losing it.

Anxiety. Depression. Insanity. Bipolar. Lost in a pitch  black labyrinth called ""Life"". Therapist is nice but, talking about your fever won't cure it. Fuck Zoloft, Prozac, you name it, fuck it. My mind is becoming like a messy room.

"Hi guys, I might need some help.

I'm dangerously close to becoming a full alcoholic. Whenever I feel down, i grab the bottle. Sometimes I get drunk 3 times a week, the minimum is 2, but sometimes it's even 6 times a week. Just got out of an 11 day drinking binge.
I'm only 18, I can't let the booze take over. My friends and I joke about, just because they don't know the extent of the problems and I'm too pussy to tell them.
I just feel so much better when I'm drunk. I am smarter, more social, don't think about my problems as much (until an hour after the last glass, then the depression really hits hard.). 
I just always feel like I have wasted the last 18 years of my life. I have litteraly nothing to be proud of. It hits hardest when my friends asked what I've done all day, and I just have nothing to say.
So whenever I'm down, I'll get drunk, knowing I'll feel better for a while.

The depression itself isn't that bad, it's not always there. I feel perfect half the time. Dunno if it's even a real depression.

Took half an hour just writing this, as I can't type correctly anymore, so I have to write the whole thing basically three times to make it correct.

Again, I don't know if this was the right place to go, but I had to talk to someone about it.",4
"The thought only came to me after a dream i had last night.  I was John Constantine (a DC comics magician who has a history of screwing over demons) and I got caught by a demon.  I was put into a torture chamber for two years (knives cutting me, demons hitting slicing me, riding a bike to exhaustion and beyond, etc) and even though it hurt like hell, I knew I would get out, I knew that the story would go on and I would be able to get back on my feet.  Yet yesterday and today, in my waking life, I felt/feel significantly depressed with no such hope.

How is my dreaming brain ""me"" and also not ""me""?  How can I feel so frickin awful while I am awake but somehow, that part of my brain isn't accessed while I am dreaming?  Something tells me most psychiatrists and neurologists still don't know the answer, but I felt compelled to ask.",0
"But I would only be depressed most of the time, 4-5/12 months or more (plus at least 3 months of self- disliking/ hate).

So I would drag that person down with me, if he/she loved me too. So I don't know if two-sided love would be the best case or worst case.

I think I'm just a burden, because most of the time I am useless and super demotivated (except for some manic phases which are &lt;2 hours long).
So I can probably never get rid of all these negative feelings. I tried, it didn't work 2/2 times. 

So what can I do except for killing myself?
I am sick, everything I think is probably wrong or distorted, and this stuff will keep coming back, will never go away. I am just a waste of time, money and nerves. Much of all of that.

And I don't even feel much about it. The only feeling I have are sadness, some relieve when it's gone for the short manic phases (after which I am crushed down by falling again) and hurt, so much hurt. 
But for some time now I've just been numb.
Could you call it a rational decision to end my life?

I had one person I thought needs me. But he is also just depressed and I can't stop his hurting. 

So...",5
"I've been a misanthrope all my life but it started with hope and now as everyday goes by, I lose every ounce of myself. I have been through a lot in my life so far, I lost my Dad who was my best friend only two months ago. He had a brain tumour operation which wasn't successful in 2015 and he was brain dead pretty much until Oct 2017 when he passed away from heart failure. He had been in hospital for a long time and since the end of 2015, I've lost who I am as a person. I not only have and went through panic disorder, anxiety (GAD) , severe depression and insomnia but also complete withdrawal. Anorexia was a hard one too, which i am still recovering from. I don't have friends (as a rule that I live by), because I don't trust human beings since I've been fucked over by so many of them in my life and the state of the world is a joke. I don't have anyone to turn to and every day, I think I'm done. I am a postgrad student but I'm lifeless as a person. I've lost passion for all the things I used to do, and the me I was is dead. She died the day my Dad fell ill, and the world I knew doesn't only no longer exist, but seems to never have existed in the first place. All the lies and the frustration makes me want to give up. This is pathetic and sad but, when I am not at university, I just eat and pretend like I'm going to go out when I never do. Sometimes I'll sit at a cafe and look like I have a lot going on, but the reality is I have nothing. I'm lucky to be able to have academic prospects but I'm only human and there needs to be a balance which in my life, there isn't. I don't care anymore and I've made an enemy of everyone I used to know. I look at people like disgusting aliens who I can't relate to and whenever I'm out, I HAVE to be back at home. 

I haven't had a productive day in years, and it seems like I'll never shake this feeling and my thoughts about the world. I really mean this : I HATE life, my life specifically. Nothing makes me happy like it used to. What amazes me are those people who can get a thrill out of a TV show, or a walk in the park or people with tons of plans and friends, or anyone who says âI'm busyâ. I'm not jealous but then again, yes I am.

Anyways, rant over",4
"Hi,

 I've been feeling incredibly tired and lethargic lately. I'm on three fucking anti-depressant (citalopram 40mg, wellbutrin 150mg and elavil 30mg) and can't even function normally. 

I've been procrastinating most of my christmas break and don't see how I'll be able to go back to work in this shape.

For the past 5 months I have really not been the same person I used to be.

It seems my family is just too angry or disappointed in me to actually help. In this plummet I have lost a lot of friends and family members so I'm turning to reddit for any kinds of tips thoughts on how to be proactive and change this mood around for good, as I am just sick and tired of it.

Every person I look to seems to either create another problem for me in their ""help"" or has no interest in helping.

"Today it finally happened. I ran out of my last money. I literally don't have enough money to pay for food. I am having financial troubles for a half year now. While I'm still at school, I do a side job to pay for my study. But that employer doesn't have work for me anymore. I have to quit. I'm probably gonna fail school and a couple of months ago I let go all my relatives. Today I have like 2 or 3 friends, but none of them are the type of friends that can borrow me anything.

"Somebody I care very much for has been on escitalopram for years due to crippling depression. He had been taking 10mg every night for years but about 2 months ago he started taking 20mg every night (2 of the 10mg tabs).

Now, for the past week and a half, he's been feeling very emotional and out of control and the past 3 or 4 days he just can't stop crying, even at work. Every little thing upsets him to the point of tears and when he talks, he almost sounds like he's drunk.

"I have no job, and I still haven't finished college. I have no friends, not mention a partner... When I check my social media, I see people that have all these things that I lack: confidence, money, intimacy, happyness. I know it's just a smokescreen, but I have nothing posted on social profile, because I don't have social events, no money nor a good job to help construct free time. I don't have self-esteem, because nobody will ever understand me, and I started isolating myself from the herd, because I wish I have studied philosophy, instead of computer science. And I hate computer science, because I am just playing with it. I don't master it, I don't understand it... therefore, I lack the skills to even be considered for a job position. Also, when an HR speaks with me in an interview, he can clearly see that I am a nervous/anxious person, which is not compatible with a youth environment. I just want to finally finish college and get a job in computer science! My obsession for thinking is also killing me, since I've also hold some unorthodox and pessimistic views, and I can't transmit any (but negative) emotion to anybody. I am more interested in philosophy, economy and politics, than in entertainment. I avoid thinking about or finding a partner, because it just makes me more aware about my holes, which in turn makes me realise that true love doesn't exist in this world. Love is materialistic, and you have to be an outcast, to trully realise that nobody will ever love a jobless, depressed, unfulfilled piece of shit. I honestly think that paying a prostitute is a much more honest 'relation', because you recognise that everything in life is just a transaction. You exchange a service for another, and if you don't have enough resourses, you will die worthless. Meanwhile, there will be others who will have too much, and being unaware of their own privilege, they will treat you like life was just for us all along. I have come to accept this cold lesson, but whenever I tell this to others, they look at me as if I am a mad man.

Leaving my philosophy aside, I am tempted, and I want to leave things as they are... So what if I am living with my mom at home? So what if I will work at McDonalds? So what if I will forever be alone? So what if I return home tired of working, and thinking about the meaningless of life? The thought of lost opportunities, drives me more crazy, than the thought of acceptance that nothing actually matters. This whole managing my whole life, so that I can become accepted in society, and messing things aroung, makes me suicidal.

So I leave this question to you: is it worth fighting to become part of socety or is it better to accept your meaningless to them and continue your 'unfulfilled' life, knowing very well, that you will face the monotony? I am tempted to put in practice the latter.",2

"So this happened a while ago and is pretty much in the past, but I went through some sort of drug induced psychosis or something. I don't know what happened but I went from half a year or so of doing nothing with my life and having no prospects, to utter ecstasy, in 45 minutes one night, the amount of time it takes for MDMA to kick in. I felt like I was the second coming of Jesus Christ, for a week, a month after, I don't know. Some sort of headspace where I thought I was the one with the ideas to save humanity. Depression to ectsasy in under an hour. I remember I had this thought ""repression of expression turns depression into aggression"", I'll get to why.

But shortly thereafter (in the days following the ""comedown"" of the MDMA but I didn't really come down, more like drug induced psychosis) I was having panic attacks and couldn't function and thought I was going to die sometimes for whatever reason. Just paranoia or whatever... very real paranoia, but just that, nothing more. It's sort of a blur looking back on it I don't remember the exact sequence of events. But eventually after ending up in the mental hospital emergency so many times they just said ""this time, you can't leave. You have 2 choices: voluntary or involuntary patient"". So I spent a night there... and that was it I didn't know how long I was going to be there. It gives a new perspective on life and how long it takes for you to start scoping out an escape route. Let's call it real life escape from Cidna mines in skyrim. It wasn't that bad though you know, comfortable beds, nice people, decent food. But there was an irony of me sitting across a table from a man scribbling ""BUZZ LIGHTYEAR"" in crayon all over a page and me scribbling circuit schematics for voltage dividers to try and explain to the nurses I was sane so they could let me out. I didn't need to plot an escape route though because I was released the next day. But for whatever reason, when I got home, this huge wave of depression hit me.... maybe it was just the rapid change of environment.... freedom, no freedom, freedom. What the hell am I supposed to do, that was the thought that came to my head... what does society want of me? To cure my diseased mind, or to put my unique mind to creative work? I didn't eat anything and just slept and then the next morning had some sort of panic attack or whatever and next thing I know I'm outside just screaming at nothing. I was hungry and thirsty and just wanted some fucking food and here are all these houses and I knocked on a door just to see if someone was there to help me but no. What a sick fucking society we live in, me with not enough water to get up over the hill (I was down in elevation maybe 100 feet, that's a big hill when you haven't eaten or drank anything and are depressed and don't have the energy to get up the hill). Yet here are dozens or maybe hundreds of houses all with water pipes in them and I can't have any. I was screaming ""GIVE ME SOME FUCKING WATER"" but of course no response. I finally just stood in the road and forced a guy in a truck to stop and I asked for his phone, and to prove to him I wasn't a thief I threw my shoe in his truck so that I'd be disadvantaged if I were to run away with his iphone. Just the fact that he gave me his waterbottle (the spontaneous social camaraderie) and the water got me up the first 50 feet or so back home. Then I just lied in the ditch because I didn't have the energy to get back up over the hill. A few cars drove by until a woman finally stopped, but (understandably looking back at it now) she drove by slowly with the doors locked and that she was of no real help (she offered some help but from a distance, not with the metaphorical open arms of the pickup truck guy) and considered me a criminal so I just yelled at her ""go the fuck to work"" or something really nasty and she drove off. But the fact that she had stopped at all gave me the energy... social comradery or whatever at least helped me find the energy to get back home.

Anyways the point of all that was that I couldn't function after that MDMA roll. I can function now, at least. But all my life I've had this anxiety of not being able to express myself in public speaking. Which is ironic because I've played music on stage in front of so many people. But I just have this fear of expressing myself, and when the fear finally burst and I spoke my mind, I lost my freedom, they put me in a mental hospital. So you can't blame me that I'm not too keen to really speak out in front of people that much... at all. I'm a smart guy, I have an engineering degree, I could design and build a computer from scratch given enough time and resources, but I just can't do the social thing. I mean in school or university they don't mind so much the creative or different ways of thinking but the mental hospital, society in general, considered me diseased. I don't relate to people that much. I haven't been on a date for almost a decade... and even back in highschool I never really connected with the girl I dated. I don't know if I did it to myself or if I'm a byproduct of the north american k-12 ""education"" system.

I just need to be able to relate to people. I can't do that and it's slowly killing me. I don't know what to do. I'm happy, but depression isn't happiness or sadness and although I've been given the same result, ""mildly/not depressed"", by different doctors, there is disorder there somewhere and I don't know how to turn it into just normal people order.",3
"I really don't know where to start, I've never been someone to shy away from sharing my feelings, but for some reason sharing my feelings with people irl right now just doesn't seem to help any more, so I'm hoping for some kind of release or anything by sharing how I feel on this sub.. I just wanna preface by saying that I'm going to talk about 3 different girls in my life, 2 of which are integral to this, (A and B), however I want to say I'm not depressed because of girls, I wouldn't be posting here if it was just about heartbreak (not that there is anything wrong with that, I just don't want people to get that imoression from this)

I've suffered from depression off/on since I was about 15, so it's been 8 almost 9 years. By off/on I mean it has hills and valleys, it's always kind of there, but at the same time kind of can go away? I don't know if that makes much sense.. right now, and definitely for the past 6 months, it's the longest time I've ever spent at the bottom of a valley, and it also happens to be one of the deepest I've ever been down. 

I'm definitely an ugly duckling story. A lot of my depression started originally as an awkward teen, I had long emo hair, I was very skinny and always have been, I was shy, had very bad social anxiety to the point I would vomit all the time, even when at school and going out with friends. I never liked the town I grew up in, people knew me to be a certain way or thing, that when I tried to change it just didn't work.. 

Fast forward from when I was 15 and when I finally moved out and went to college, at 18, I had truly 'blossomed'. I looked good. And for my 4 years at college I slayed. I've been with over 100 women, spent my nights going out partying, spending all my time with friends.. everything went away, my anxiety, my depression and my awkwardness. 

During that time however, I experienced an emotionally abusive relationship with girl A (protecting names).. this was in the early days, and she amplified all my problems tenfold (until I finally escaped and my mental health improved).

I met the girl of my dreams (at the time) when I was 20, and things were great until it ended, which sent me in to a spiral of sleeping with so many women to block out my feelings, I drank a shit tonne, I even did drugs (I'm not proud of it, and it was completely against character, I regret it deeply, but I'm just glad I wasn't hurt nor did I hurt anyone else during that time). This continued for a few months, and I finished college, jumped from job to job and had no clue where my life was going.. 

Then I met B. I met her just before I turned 22, and it was the best thing that's ever happened to me. She took away my pain and gave me help and support to steady myself in a way that nobody else ever had. I was so shut off from feelings and shut off from wanting to show emotion, that it took her a while for me to get me out of my cage that I had locked myself if.. but it was great, and I will always appreciate her for that... 

I moved home from Aberdeen where I had been to do college, due to a failed business attempt, and my flatmate was moving away too. B was staying in Aberdeen, and we decided on a ""long distance"" relationship. And it was fine, no problems whatsoever. I only lived a couple hours away on the train, so I saw her basically every weekend. Whilst home I started working with my dad, and just wanted to save money up. 

One day, girl A messaged me.. I didn't want anything to do with her but B told me to forgive her and be friends.. I guess she was just too trusting. I decided to tell A I forgive her and we can be friends, but I never messaged her or anything and was just polite when she messaged me, but in all I left her alone.. This is the part that makes my blood boil, and makes my heart ache.. B and I fell out over a friend she had trying to say shit about me.. (she hated me, and I had no reason why).. that night I messaged A and we had deep chats and one thing lead to another and flirtatious texts were sent and a couple photos. I felt horrible. And I stupidly kept it a secret.. this all happened in January or last year.. and then in June of last year, girl A told girl B everything, as I had deleted and blocked A out of my life and she didn't like that... I have no clue what sparked it.. my only regret is I wasn't considerate and honest enough to tell B about what I did... 

Flash forward to today and I'm alone.. and have been since June. And this brings me to how I currently feel, and why I'm frustrated with where I'm at.. obviously going through college taught me how to break out of my depression, and I've been trying to follow it but... Nothings working and has started revealing more problems.. 

If you've made it this far then thank you so much. There's not much more to read. 

I feel now lost more than ever. I've been going to the gym constantly almost every day for the past 4 months, to stay healthy and hoping it would keep me busy. I've gained weight, and physically I feel incredible. I've gone from 9st 9lbs to 11st and I feel I've finally escaped skinny me and all the people that made fun of my for looking like a rake (girl A). But it's not helped how I feel in my head.. 

I don't feel connected to my friends anymore, they've all moved away and I rarely get to see them, and most messaged go unanswered for days because they're busy.. I only have one friend that still lives in my town, and it pains me to say but I feel like the relationship isn't what it once was, and that we've gone on different paths, so it just feels awkward when I see him, however I do try to keep it going because I know isolation KILLS. 

I spend time with my family a lot, I love my family and they're very supportive and understand how I feel. However it just doesn't feel the same as hanging out with friends, and I find myself getting frustrated being around them a lot, even though they've shown me nothing but love, and it makes me feel even more awful feeling that way.

I've thrown myself in to further studies and with work. I'm studying accounting niw to keep busy, and I work hard at my job to keep busy and give me money. I spend all my time working, studying, gyming, hanging out with family, and trying to see friends, so my life is full, but my heart just feels empty. I feel like I'm rotting from the inside.. 

I also don't connect with any of the things that once we're a great pastime for me.. video games just aren't the same as they were, I don't connect to any of the nerdy shit I used to like and I don't know what else to be interested in.. 

And finally.. I miss girl B. I no longer contact her, as I know she hates me for betraying her. I know she's getting on with her life, new man, working hard, all that.. I've deleted and blocked her from everything and haven't looked to see what she's up to (I just know what she's up to due to a friend telling me without me asking which felt like a fucking knife..). The old 20 year old me wants to hook up with girls and ""get under someone to get over someone"" but, I can't. My head and heart won't let me. I've tried meeting up with a couple girls but I just can't get in to it at all, and I have no desire to be with them.. 

Just to put a cherry on top the ice cream, girl A is now dating a friend who lives back in Aberdeen, so I've decided to cut him out of my life.. because I can't have any connection to girl A.. that's done a lot of horrible things to me in my life. 

I don't know if any of this makes sense at all, or if I even deserve to be posting here.. I'm working hard, going to gym, even seeing a therapist, keeping busy as all hell.. but still I feel so numb inside and wake up crying at night, unable to get my head and heart to agree to keep looking to the future.. 

Thanks for reading if you have. I don't actually expect anyone to but thank you if you have..",3
"Oh well, took it. I'll keep you guys updated. I have determined that I'm just anxious about my return to college and maybe going through a career midlife crisis.

My general sadness isn't really comparable to some folks in this community so I won't complain. I just feel bummed out that I haven't made much progress towards my career path. Also I'm freaking balding..


I think I'm using variety tv shows as escapism as I always fantasize and wonder what life would be like if I was them. Tomorrow I'm going to follow up on the schedule I've set myself up with and study... be productive.


I'm still not sure if I'm depressed or just going through a small phase of the blues. Maybe it's just really mild.. but then who doesn't have depression then?",2
"But not because I was sad but because I was so happy. I'm spending some days with friends in a bigger city and we were planning on going to a prayer at 11 pm and then to a party. But I am crazily scared of fireworks (childhood trauma here you go) so I decided last minute to stay at our accommodation. A few minutes later 3 friends decided to come back because they were worried and didn't want me to spend New Year's Eve alone. I resisted in the beginning but they made they're decision and stayed with me. We had a small prayer and Christmas cookies and just spend some beautiful hours together. Afterwards they said it was the most beautiful New Year's Eve they've ever had and same applies to me because I'm used to spending it alone and having a breakdown. I am just so happy and it's unbelievable for me someone actually cared about me. 

However my ex roommate texted me as well how much she enjoyed being my roommate and how much I taught her. 

These things are so important for me right now because I realized I'm really deep in my depression again and struggling with my current situation. I didn't think I meant anything to anyone and I was just being there but all of this showed me that there are people that care. 

And there are also people out there that care about you. You might not think they do or find it completely unbelievable but there are people that care and that would miss you if you'd just be gone. Take care. ",4
"Hi all, I have been struggling with the idea of being too greedy.
I mean: I have people who love me (family, friends, partners, pets), I have a job with an acceptable salary, I have hobbies.
Lately I haven't been feeling competent, but I know I am good in my job, and also that I am a good, nice, kind person who cares about others.
So, what do I have to complain about? Why am I not satisfied? Why do I want more? 
Meh.",2
"I wanted to hear some opinions on a decision that has been bothering me for the past few months. No one I've asked irl seems to want to tell me what they actually think, just telling me to decide on my own.

I'm a sophomore at university, and I've been severely depressed for about two years now. Over the last year, my depression has gotten worse and worse. This last month of school, I didn't go one morning without crying, I constantly just wanted to go home. For whatever reason, being at school, being at my apartment in my university town, is miserable for me. 

My counselor suggested that if I wanted, I could take this spring semester off with medical leave. 

I don't want to stop school. I know it wouldn't be a ""failure"" to take a medical break, but it sure feels like it. I can't even imagine a future in which I don't go back to school. I don't know what I would do with myself at home. Lounge around in my tiny town and work retail? I don't know if that would help me at all. 

On the other hand, this December was easily the worst month of my life. The last two weeks of school I had to fight every day to get up in the morning; just walking across campus without wanting to break down and cry was a struggle. I know university has become this negative space for me, and I guess it would make sense that I get away.

I don't want to leave school, despite all of this. School is the only thing I really have. I don't have any activities or friends. I go to school, go to the gym, do homework, and sleep. Once school is taken away from me, I will have nothing. Maybe it is a blank slate that I need? But maybe once this is taken away I truly will cease to be a functioning member of society. 

I'm scared that if I leave school, I won't find my momentum again, and I won't ever go back. But if I go back and it's anything like this December, I won't make it. 

I really don't know what to do.

"Hey guys, so this might be a little long but I'll put a tl:dr at the end.

I've had depression ranging from severe to moderate (depending on the month tbh) for the past couple of years along with social/general anxiety, kickstarted by the loss of my dad and made worse through by going through college with 0 friends and having absolutely nothing social to do. Last year I went to a psychiatrist who put me on Paxil, told me it'd do away with both my depression and anxiety and gave me a bunch of BS advice about how to make friends and the like (common sense type stuff I already know and try). Well after a month of Paxil I kinda turned into a different person, my anxiety was completely gone but my depression was through the roof, leading to me making a LOT of bad decisions. I went back to my psychiatrist telling him that I didn't think it was helping my depression, and he said that's normal and upped my dose from 20mg to 30mg. This made everything WAY worse; I felt like I was slightly drunk all the time (only comparison I can think of), and my inhibitions were like always gone. I started smoking cigarettes, hiring escorts, getting in fights with people for no reason, just crazy shit I NEVER would have done before. My general anxiety came back and then some, I started having panic attacks almost daily, hobby's I used to love just seemed worthless and boring, it just made everything I took it to prevent worse. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but on Paxil they were daily. It culminated in my roommates having an intervention with me telling and reminding me of everything I'd done and just how much more of a miserable asshole I'd become. So I stopped taking the Paxil (those brain zaps were fun) and went back to my psychiatrist explaining all of this to him, and he told me it had nothing to do with the Paxil and I just wasn't following his advice (which consisted of ""talk to people"", ""you don't need friends in college"", ""girls will like you when you have a successful career in the future"").

Since being off the Paxil I have gone back to my old self, my roommates and my family have both told me I seem back to normal, I feel like I used to, I can enjoy video games and fishing again, but I'm still just as depressed and anxious as I was before the Paxil (plus now I'm hooked on cigarettes, so thanks for that Paxil). I went to my primary care doctor last week and explained all of this to him, and he recommended I see a psychologist, and gave me a script for 25mg Zoloft and .5mg Klonopin. I'm working on finding a psycologist at the moment, and the Klonopin helps a lot with my anxiety (though I know it's a benzo and not a long term solution), but I'm literally terrified to start Zoloft. I don't want to go through another experience like Paxil, I can say without a doubt that those 5 months were the worst most shameful and miserable of my life. So, with all that said, does anyone know if Zoloft is likely to cause this misery again? Or really does anyone just have any advice for me? I feel like I'm in a pit and everything they give you just digs the pit even deeper, I just need some advice.

TL:DR - Was prescribed Paxil for 5 months, turned me into a monster and made me feel absolutely terrible. Now have a 25mg Zoloft perscription and am terrified of what's gonna happen when I take it. Any advice?",3
"My brother in law 'has depression' and I say this because he hasn't been formally diagnosed. We live together and are quite close, but he never talks about his feelings. He went to the emergency department the other day for a panic attack and they gave him anti depressants and now he needs to see a doctor to find out what's wrong. Fair enough right, he most likely has depression/anxiety combo. 
Meanwhile he has splashed it all over facebook and messaged all of his friends. Told everyone he works with. And posted pictures of his anti depressants on facebook.
He will not stop talking about it but yet will not talk about his feelings thoughts or anything deeper than 'i went to the doctor for depression'. 
I get it if he doesn't wanna talk but everything he does makes me angry because here I am suffering in silence for the past 12 years. I finally opened up to his mum a few months ago (we're very close) about it and she's urged me to see a doctor and my boss holds me to seeing a doctor soon so I can get better and stop self harming. 
And then he turns around and pulls this shit. I finally felt like I was getting the support I needed to go and get help and he makes everything all about him. So I opened up to him about my self harm and how I've been struggling for a long long time, and he basically told me my cuts were nothing to worry about and I was clearly fine. 
Sorry for the rant I just finally felt like I was making the last few steps towards getting help and now I want nothing to do with it because here he is glamorizing the whole thing and sucking everyone in and away from me.",3
"I'm going through a pretty rough breakup right now, and... I have no one, anymore. I have no one in my life now that I have lost my dove. And it's entirely my fault that I lost her. I fucked up, and now there's nothing left.

I have no idea why I'm doing this. I guess, I just wanted people to see. See some of my conversations with a therapist on trying to improve myself, and... my failing to do so. Just so I can show people that... I tried. This is the first conversation between my therapist and I, about three months ago. I guess you should know I'm pretty straightforward usually and... I'm also pretty fucked up. I was trying to become a better man, for myself... but mostly for her.


I don't know if this will actually interest anyone, but... Well, maybe someone will be kind enough to grant me some company or companionship right now... I am in a very, very dark place and... I would rather have died than to have lost that girl, even... even if we weren't really happy together. I took out the names because... well, the girl in question knows about my therapist, as it was her suggestion and all and.. Despite the fact she will never see this, I still don't want it to be recognized if she does.


 *Hello, &lt;//////&gt;. My name is &lt;/////&gt;. I guess I don't know where to start. Right now, the particular issue I'm having is that my insecurity has been the cause of every relationship I've had failing, and is ruining my current relationship. I have no idea how to stop it. I'm too needy, too clingy, unable to control my emotions at all. I am obsessive, and possessive. I am a hateful, spiteful, angry person and I have no idea how to let go of the things that have happened in the past. I want to change, but all anyone ever says is ""only you can do that"" and ""only you know how"" and that doesn't help. If it's all up to me, then it's hopeless.*


&gt; Hi ///// - Thanks you so much for reaching out and sharing so information about your experiences. My name is ////// ////// and I am a licensed therapist. Reaching out for help takes courage /////, you have made a wonderful first step toward creating the life you have always wanted. You talked about being really sensitive right now and how the way that you are feeling and responding to others is causing a great deal of distress. Based on the things you have shared, what you are feeling makes perfect sense. I have experience working with individuals who are interested in working through the barriers and unresolved issues in life to find a higher level of peace and joy. I would like the opportunity to help you this this time in your life. I would like for you to review my online schedule and select a day and time for us to have a live video session. This session would enable me to share the limits of confidentiality, review consent for therapy, explain what you can expect throughout the therapeutic process and answer any question you may have. Be encouraged, I think therapy might be a chance for a new beginning for you!! In the meantime, can you share more about how you have been dealing with all of the things you are experiencing? Who supports you in times like these?


*I have very few people that I have kept around me. I have no network of real friends, I have no support group. The majority of my emotional stability becomes the responsibility of the person I am romantically involved in, and this causes a great deal of stress to the both of us, and is generally an unhealthy way of handling things. I have only one or two true companions in my life, my closest and oldest of which I no longer get to see because he has moved far away and only visits rarely. Any occasional acquaintances I happen to make almost always end quickly, or never develope beyond anything other than a work mate or occasional social interaction. My family has either moved states away, or has so much drama and conflict that I do not feel it would be beneficial to bring them into my own.*

 *There are many worse things, though, that I feel probably ought to be brought to attention sooner or later. There have been many traumatic events I have experienced from childhood to adulthood that have left me a very isolated person. Even when there are people who try to reach out to me, I do not trust them with knowing most things, and do not want to burden them with my emotional issues. I am not an open person. I also have been diagnosed with ADHD and Insomnia, and the last psychiatrist I saw I didn't spend enough time with to confirm but it is also suspected that I have manic depressive bi-polar disorder or another emotional instability illness based on the time I spent with them and the fact that most of my family has been diagnosed with MDBPD.*

 *As for how I've been dealing with it, I've tried many things over the years, most of which weren't beneficial. Drug and alcohol abuse was severe during particular periods of time. I cannot maintain hobbies or interests for any period of time that could be considered significant. Mostly I just lay in bed, being miserable. I do not have the energy, the focus, or the motivation to do anything. I never have.*

*Many people have told me to seek therapy in the past, but the only time I was ever actually involved in psychiatric evaluation was when I was around 17 or 18, still in high school. At least, that's the only ""adulthood"" memory I can account for. When I was younger, my brothers and I were all involved in group therapy because we had all been sexually assaulted repeatedly by the son of a family friend. I was too young to remember those sessions, though, and the molestation didn't actually end for years following, nor was that the only individual to do so.*

"My high school career wasnt the best but it certainly was full of great memories and long term friendships *(some of which I am still in contact with over a decade later)*. Whenever I go through old pictures or Facebook posts/messages from my high school days, I instantly feel sad and depressed because of how much fun those days were and that I can never re-live those amazing days ever again. What makes this feeling worse is that I've lost contact with many of my close high school friends so even if I wanted to get in contact with them again, it couldnt happen. Some I know have moved to different cities/countries and some now have families and established careers and im just sitting here going through old memories wishing that I could re-live those days. We're all happy when high school is finally over but many years later, that feeling isnt the same anymore.

"Hey guys,

So yes to spend 2018 off i am crying alone in my bedroom thinking where did it all go wrong and nearly attempting suicide.

Ive been building up my depression for over 15 years... pretty much starting when my parents broke up. I always use to have anxiety feeling that would make my gut whirl following with bad events taken place in 15mins... this resulting in a massive ammount avoiding bad incidents and essentially hiding from them. 

Coming to the present i feel like i am slowly getting to the point where friends are harder to come by and my current friends are slowly moving on with their own lives and leaving me behind (i feel like this due to not being invited anywhere or left to the last minute it makes me feel like a total loser when i have to ask someone what theyre doing) i also dont have the courage to find a soulmate purely due to knowing where to look or how to approach someone.

Anyways i want to know of anyone else success stories on tackling depression for the first time as i strongly beleive ive been stuck in this cloud for months. Hoping to seek advice from a professional.

My main wave of depression kicks in when i feel like my soul has a purpose it is pretty clear due to when stimulating my brain with something exciting that makes me feel like a have a purpose (this could be a simple as talking to someone) and the moments after said event finishing and the sense of importance to my existing fading.

Im sorry if this doesnt make sense but i got to the point where i nearly killed my self driving home though i told myself i think its time that i depended on someone for a chance and that i dont need to hold onto all the pain.

This world is tough no matter who we are... there is a few user online this NYE anyone reading please dont give up even though it may appear close friends and family dont care about you/me but sadly this is the true power of depression and in most cases causing the mind to be clouded. 

Life currently has taught me to respect everyone how you would like to be respected.",4

"i have liked her for so long.. once i confessed to her and i got rejected. even so, i still harboured feelings towards her. but then today came around and i saw her whatsapp status: 'I love ___"" . this may be really childish compared to whats on this reddit thread, but i just wanted to let go of how i honestly feel. It hurts me, it really does. who would have thought being a human would be this painful....",4
"Jan. 17, 2017 I told myself I was sick of going through every year wanting to die, wishing for death, and that if things hadn't changed I wouldn't see the start of 2018. For the first time in over a decade I had a couple months where I didn't want to kill myself, and that fell apart as quickly as it started. I'm worse off than I've been in a long time, and attempted suicide 4 times in the past 3 months, ending up with two hospitalizations and being committed to behavioral center. The only thing that kept me from attempting tonight is a fear of failure, ending up back in a hospital, and the fact that I now live with my parents again. I guess the fact that at some point last year I didn't want to die made me hesitant to follow through with my promise, but honestly I hate that I didn't. It's just another thing that I couldn't hold myself to. I don't really know why I'm writing this, I wanted to tell someone but I don't have anyone to tell that will actually listen at this point. Happy New Year friends ",3

"Hello everyone, I'm new to reddit so I'm not quite sure how it works but I felt I needed a platform to discuss this so here goes. I'm 17 I live in Sheffield, England and for the past few months I have have been dealing with depression and it is tearing me apart LISA (love you if you get that reference). In all seriousness, I feel so disconnected from everyone around me and it scares me to death. My 'friends' are all busy with relationships or with their own friend groups which is a thing I've never been apart of, I've always just had friends who had friend groups so I would be in a weird position. I often have very self loathing style thoughts and have very little to no self esteem. I feel like my friends are using me in a sense that they only call me if they need help with college work or I'm the last option because the rest of their friends were busy. I can't do anything though because I don't want to risk losing the few friends I do have. They all come to me with the stories of the great nights out or the holidays they all have planned and when they ask what I was up to, which is rare, I just have to say ""nothing"" and it makes me so deflated. I haven't felt genuine happiness in months and that is due to the lonliness, I would get back out there and look for someone but I have no confidence in myself so I'm terrified to do so. I can't feel like I can talk to anyone about it because they shouldn't have to put up with it which makes writing it here a bit ironic but oh well. In summary I'm scared. I'm scared of what the future holds, what happened in the past and I'm scared of the present and I'm not expecting any sympathy or world class uplifting guidance I just needed a place to vent. So if you managed to read through all of this then thank you for letting me vent. You are a truly great person. ",5
"I don't really want to die, or rather I don't have any reason to and I want to not want to die, but I still know that probably in the next 5-10 years I'll just do it. I won't make some long post here, I won't call for help or show any major signs, I probably won't even give/have a good reason, I just know that one day I'm going to wake up and go throughout my day like normal, and then just jump off the roof or hang myself or something. The older I get the less in control of my own thoughts I feel, but I also feel like I have a better understanding of them. I can see how people can just go crazy and seemingly snap and start killing people or hijack a bus or start just running around naked or something, and if anything I'm lucky enough to know that I have no urge to harm others and would do anything to save someone that isn't myself, but I just feel the need to off myself and I know that eventually it'll just happen. Lately I've noticed myself getting into a lot more dangerous situations I think maybe because I feel a need to have control over my own death, and that getting in random fights with junkies on the subway and getting hit by cars when chasing the bus excites me because my life (or death) isn't in my control. I don't know maybe I'm the only one that feels this way but I wanted to see if anyone else had any similar experiences or tips with how to feel less trapped by my own depression.",1

"I've been on 2 different meds in the past, and they either didn't work, or wore off after a few months so I never went back to the doctor to try others.

Even if there is one out there that works for me, it could takes years of trial and error before I find it.

It might be loneliness, grief, pain, or feeling lost. There's one instance where I was suicidal, long story short I think scared a lot of people that were close to me. I think they won't talk to me because of that. I know what makes me happy and what makes me feel good. I try to do all of those things, but lately it hasn't had any effect. ",5

"Hi everyone, first things first I hope everyone have a fantastic 2018 around your friends and family

Moving to my story. So, I met this friend through Youtube in 2012 since he was a portuguese gaming youtuber for adults (due to his language and way of talk) which I enjoyed a lot. 

I got the chance to start talking with him late 2015 and alongside a couple more viewers, old friends of him and his girlfriend, we were a group of 7 to 8 elements that throughout 2016 we usually hangout a lot on teamspeak (group voice chat) playing games and talking about life and stuff... 

It got very intimate my conversasions with him, told almost my whole life to him, about my sad past and he told me all his lifestrories too. Through 2016 it was all amazing... 

But mid 2017 our group started breaking apart, 2 of us stepped away (which i joined them later) 1 disappeared due to UNI stuff which I respect,  his girlfriend was left almost alone (which I will explain next), and him which joined a new group of paying-friends (which I will explain too) 

So, apparantly he was doing youtube only as a Hobbie and every cent he took from there in publicity was just a ""way to thank him"" for the amazing job he did. He had about 10k views per day on his videos but due to youtube polices he wasn't earning enough to make a living of that, but it was helping playing his bills. 

So he decided to move to twitch,  which is a live streaming platform focused for gamers. He was quite a success there and started making quite some cash on donations and monthly supporting subscriptions...

Later he started leaving our group and started talking more with the ones who were giving him the money (top donators)  instead of his friends who were never with him for the money...

He left us, we asked him why,  and his awenser was that US refused to join him, which was half true, because I personally didn't wanted to join and secondly he was the one leaving. 

I started noticing that his girlfriend was getting sad,  by posting sad songs over and over on her facebook, and I started asking if was something wrong, and she trusted me that the relationship wasn't going well (after 3 years together), he was spenting less and less time with here, starting with excuses to not visit her personally and stuff like that. 

During that time in october I got a bombshell, his girlfriend told me that he told her that met one of his female subscribers on twitch personaly and ""just"" kissed her,  cheating on my friend/his girlfriend...

I don't know why she forgived him, even after that he didn't changed his attitude,  he continues flirting every girl that pops on his stream...

I was the one supporting her through this rough time, trying to cheer her up in every chance I got, playing with her,  watching some videos and stuff... She was thankful to me, and I was like ""thats what real friends do right?"". 

But between me and him,  he just started to ignore me more and more,  he had time to play with his paying friends but to awenser a simple ""hello""  from me took weeks.

Like,  i'm not obcessed with him,  i'm just truely disaponted with him and his atittude... Swapping friends for money,  and leave his girlfriend suffering all the time... 

I exploded... I couldn't hold this anymore,  so,  I decided to let know every single paying supporter of his stream know,  to what type of person they are giving the money to...

How? Just with simple ""memes"" (images with text) comparing him to Dr. Disrespect (One of the biggest twitch streamers who admited publicly he cheated om his wife,  and had the balls to stoo streaming to solve his issues). I criticized my friend for only caring about the money and putting that over his girlfriend that loves him more then everything even after he cheated on her... 

What happened next was: He blocked me everywhere instead of asking me why I did such thing,  since he didn't did that,  I asume that I asume that I wasn't a friend for him anymore, and decided to run away and delete me from everywhere. 

The thing is now everyone knows what type of person he his, and let them know if someone with even more money comes,  they can be left behind. But since now my ex friend doesn't want to lose his funding (since he now lives from donations makong it a full time job). I don't want the other to happen what happened to me... 

Am I regreted of what I done? Nope! The only ""if""  point here was how his girlfriend reacted after I did this... I clearly see that she was sad,  and things could have been solved other way without exposing his life,  which I disagree, I exposed one thing about his life,  so the way she meant was the life as a whole,  which I didn't exposed

She is the only reason that this is upsetting me... I have 0 regrets on him,  but on her... I never wanted her to be sad at me because of this...  Never was my intention... 

This is my first post here... Just wanted to share my story,  if theres something you guys missunderstood due to my average english,  please comment below,  I really wanted to get this out of me...  If readed till the end... Thanks :)

"I just want to start this off by saying that I've never felt better than I do now. In the past few years I've dropped out of high school, managed to find an alternative way to graduate, and then pass a semester of college to drop out of the next one. I've struggled with finding the purpose of everything my entire life and therefore never put any effort into anything I've done.

I've been on and off three depression medications in the past and now I just recently started my third. I truly can't tell a difference when I'm on or off the medication. I don't know if I have depression or just a lack of motivation to do anything. I don't know what's wrong with me, or if there's even a depression medication that can help me.

My psychiatrist visits last about 5-10 minutes with her prescribing me a medication and sending me on my way. My parents really dislike her because of her medication strategy, but she's the only one in my area for 300 miles. With all that being said, She prescribed me dextroamphetamine 3 months ago alongside my depression medication and I was able to close out this college semester with a 4.0, I've been able to wake up for work everyday at 4 AM and work anywhere from 8-12 hours a day for the past 2 weeks while on break and I'm taking care of myself better than I ever have before.

I feel so good, but I'm worried. I'm losing track of the pills of dextroamphetamine I'm using a day. I have to down 5 pills of melatonin a night to get sleep, I have to down 4 pills of ibuprofen every morning because I've been working my body so hard. I down 6 pills of dextroamphetamine throughout the day to keep my energy up and enjoy being at work. I'm going to become addicted, I'm going to build up too much tolerance, I won't be like this for very much longer and I'm worried. I wish I could feel energized all the time, why do I have to use medication to function. I wish I wasn't so lonely that I have to open up to reddit because I have nobody else. Why can't I be normal. Why did I even bother typing this. Why am I looking for acceptance right now. I don't even know how many pills I'm downing in a day just to accomplish a regular work day that everyone else can do normally. The answer is that it's too much.",2
"I've been experiencing depression for around 6-7 years now, and there's a theme I've found in my experience when I'm not in a terrible, suicide attempt-filled rut: I feel as though I settle for everything.  Whether it be my skills as a musician (one of the few things I cherish in life), my relationship status, or my career/educational field.  I currently am not as good of a guitarist as I should be, if I actually put in more work.  I'm very lazy, and almost scared to do it, for fear that I will fail.  I'm settling for my mediocre skills there.  I'm seeing someone, and have been for a little over three months (with a one week break in the middle there), who I don't love.  She's a great friend, but i would admit that since it's my first term, I really did jump at the first chance I had for a relationship.  She's madly in love with me, but I have no feelings for the greater part of the time we've been together.  I'm afraid of being alone.  I'm aware I'm hurting her by doing this, and she doesn't even know it.  So I'm also settling in the relationship realm.  On top of those two, I just started last fall at a college I don't enjoy being at.  Don't get me wrong, the education is amazing, and I got on the deans list for my first term, but I moved from Chicago to this rural area for college and I'm bored out of my fucking mind there.  I go back on Monday, by the way.  Fun stuff.  I'm settling here as well, because I'm getting an education somewhere that I don't necessarily enjoy being at.

Does anyone know how to get past all of these instances of ""not nearly good enough"" being what I stick to?  I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense.  I didn't know who to ask. ",5
"I have this constant feeling that I am invisible to everyone else. When someone talks to me directly I feel so strange, in a good way though. 

I feel extremely conceited for saying this, but I want someone, anyone, to tell me to my face that they think I have some kind of redeeming quality, or something that makes me stand out. I feel ugly, dumb, and talentless all the time. I am just mediocre at best when it comes to anything. 

I wish that when I walked into a room, people noticed me. But they don't, I'm always a ghost or a fly on the wall, whether I want to be or not.",5
"I feel like I've lost all that is good in this world.  I use to have so many dreams and ideas of things I wanted to do.

"So I feel like it's sorta stupid to be making a Reddit about what I feel but to be honest no one else really listens to me it feels like, so without further delay here's my bullshit day in a nutshell. So before I give you a rundown on my shitty days I should let you know that I am in high school and have Touretts, not where I curse or anything like that but where I make weird movements, over my life I have been able to control these in most situations in front of people but lately it's been much harder. Every day I wake up and feel a lomming ball of sadness and stress as I get dressed and go to the buss. Sometimes I try to talk to some people but I find it hard because it's almost as if they only want to really talk on Snapchat and not in person. Most days I just pretend to be happy and try to remember all the random bullshit we need to learn in school (even though I don't understand why it's taught I still remember it). I used to get straight As in middle school but lately I've been getting Cs Bs and As (which I'm fine with for some reason). Anyway my parents usually scream at me about my grades even if there not that bad. they ended up sending me to a therapist because they said I was acting different And wasn't making enough friends. For some reason I kept lieing to the theripist  because I found it hard to describe my sadness in words. He ended up telling me that he was only a adult therapist and blew me off. I felt like I should have told him the truth but to be honest if he couldn't see that I wasn't telling it he was a shitty therapist. Ever scince then I've been going down a dark void that I can't escape (metaphorically of course) I still wake up every day depressed and my Tourette's is out of control even in happy moments I am sad and feel like I can't find happiness no matter what happens. I don't want to kill my self btw but I'm not afraid of dieing if you know what I mean. I also found this hard to right because there's so many more details I left out and sill couldn't describe my sadness I hope I did good enough to get you a idea of what I'm going through. ",3
"I've seen several - both male and female - throughout my life. None of them gave a flying fuck about my problem(s). All they're after is cash. Some are quite proficient at pretending they're interested in your persona; caress one's ego &amp; generate dependence, i.e. more cash. Others like to act from a position of strength, put you down like a dominatrix for the fun of it. Luckily, i don't get addicted easily and still have a certain level of pride. When i left, they acted all pissed, trying to give me bad conscience.
Now, i apologize in advance to any prostitute i might have offended. But i can say from experience that what i said holds true to therapists (both medical and non-medical); at least in my area.",5
Curious as to this? I get in a bitter angry mood and come here. Then I see everyone else suffering the same thing and I get even more bitter and angry. Almost like kindling to an already burning fire.,3

"My car needs a new steering pump.

Not really sure exactly what this is going to entail or what the goal here is, but I'm just going to explain my situation because I feel like telling someone will help me in the short term while things happen.

I'm a 25 year old male living in Vancouver, Canada. I'm basically a hikikomori if you know what that is, though not as bad these days. Roman Catholic mom(fairly devout), agnostic dad. 7 child family. Went to a catholic private school grades 1-7(and about half of 8 or so{I believe because of money}). I've always been fairly shy and introverted. I've had depression since I was about 13-14. It feels like manic depression, I can't be sure though because I've never seen anyone about it. Suicidal feelings from around 15-now. (not as bad now, but still scary sometimes)

I had lived in a fairly small town from when I was 6 to about 12, when my family had to move due to my dad being laid off. We never had much money. I'd had some decent friends and a pretty normal life there. I was happy. I went to 4 seperate schools(including a small stint of home schooling) immediately after this through grades 8-9 due to moving around, and ended up going into a pretty good public high school near me. 

Due to my introverted tendencies, the constant changing social environment, and making some progress with relationships that were cut off when I had to move again I think I just stopped wanting to make relationships with people.

I stayed at that school from 9-12, didn't have any serious issues. Never made any real friends. People tended to like me if they talked to me at school, but I wouldn't want to deal with most of them outside of it at all. We only had 1 computer in the house at this point, and I spent as much time on it as I was allowed. Through my mom's love of lord of the rings and her discovery of irc and nerd chat rooms, I eventually came to play a game called guild wars, which is amazing and you should play it. Not 2 though.

Anyways, while playing this game I met a guy and eventually bonded with him over just general internet things and general philosophy kind of stuff. We became pretty good internet friends and he was my only real friend I felt I had from something like 15-19. He proceeds to get girlfriend and as a result he finds he wants to spend most of his time working on his life in their relationship. I grow sort of bitter towards him since then. We still talk but it's just bullshit and it makes me hate myself and him for not being honest I guess. bromances are hard.

I lived with my family up until july 2016, when I moved into a top floor rental suite with a brother and sister. They're both constantly going out/bringing people over and it's annoying for many reasons. I had to use my credit card to pay for rent for the first few months, and have a bit of debt as a result. I've never been good with job stress and just holding a job for long periods, but I'm currently working at a sorting/shipping warehouse. It's not bad but it doesn't pay all that much and it's been stressful lately, I've been considering just walking out and hoping to god welfare will accept me if I see a counsellor or something. I have a small amount of money saved that could almost pay off the debt and leave me with nothing if I use the tax return from this year, maybe. 

I've had other friendships and relationships of various levels of seriousness, all mostly around not serious and just bullshit, in the time since. Not really in the last few years because of what ends up happening with them though. Whenever it ends up becoming somewhat serious which usually ends up happening, someone(often myself) can't handle it and has to go.

Over time I've just become less and less interested in having any sort of relationship with people. They're all shit when you get down to it(I know this isn't really how it is, but it's how it feels, socially). I hate people. 

The resulting state of my mind is not good. I'm terrible lonely and constantly think of how it might feel to actually have someone that I could love. Every day I constantly feel like I should just kill myself as it doesn't really matter in the big picture, but I feel to guilty because i'd hurt too many people. So every day I'll say I wish I could kill myself today but I can't. I have nieces and nephews and a mom that would be devastated. I'm lucky to have a single person that I actually also met on guild wars, that I can still talk to seriously and consider a friend even though I'm not sure how close. I might be dead without him. 

It's just that in this new house, without my parents. Without that 1 close friend I'd had on the internet in high school. Without any meaningful relationship with a girl ever other than 1 or 2 botched online ones, I'm so fucking lonely.

Every day it gets more unbearably lonely. I've smoked pot since graduation, walking to a grad party some ""friends"" had some alcohol/pot, and had always been sort of pressuring me and I'd been turning them down. I decided it was grad party time and fuck it, I'd wanted to try drugs for a long time anyways. Pot is amazing and has helped me a lot, but relying on it in times when your depression gets this bad and you need to constantly smoke more and more, it starts to just make you feel worse after a while if you don't do anything else/figure something out. I'm cutting back and trying to do something about it but when you've been on the internet this long and hate people this much etc there's not much I want to do except have someone that I love and who loves me. Which I will never have because that person can't possibly exist, and I wouldn't meet them if they did, and they don't deserve to have this broken piece of shit tied to them if they did. 

What I hope for is that I'll end up leaving this job, getting on welfare, rent my own place somewhere cheap and start drawing/painting doing other stuff I've wanted to do. Open up to people and find a girl that I could be serious with forever. One day support myself off of something that I like doing. 

I don't really know what I need to be happy, I just know that I'm definitely not right now. I know that it would definitely help to have a relationship. I can't go out seeking one in the state that I'm in right now though. I'll continue going on not killing myself. And being paranoid and hoping that things will eventually get better and the balance will tip. I don't know. :(

There's a lot more that I've left out because I don't want this to legit be my life story.

TL;DR: basically my life story. 

ask me stuff I might answer

my name: I've seen ""man wipes"" where I work, and they're the first funny thing to came to mind when every other throwaway account name I thought of is used. It made me happy for a second.

ps

if you're a cute girl that wants to talk/thinks they might like me/is in the same boat or whatever, send me a pm. I don't know if I'll answer, right now probably not. but I hope maybe I will? Let's make a new character and play guild wars please. Ignore my confidence issues.

So my ex and I were dating for a while. 2 years this April. Throughout the relationship we both âflirted' with other people but never physically cheated. For the past couple months it wasn't working and we mutually decided to call it off New Year's Eve. Being in so much pain last night I slept with someone else hoping it would help at least sone of the pain. It didn't. My ex and I spoke on the phone after it while I was driving home and agreed on whatever happened while we were single happened and wanted to talk after a few weeks and maybe give us another shot. The anxiety took over and I told her I slept with someone else and hearing her cry like that broke me even more. She told me there's no chance now we're ever getting back together and it's done for good. Does she really mean it or is she saying it because she's hurt? ,4
"I guess I'm looking for 3rd party opinions and maybe a little support if anyone else is in the same predicament. TMS has been the only thing to work for me, but its efficacy might be fleeting and insurance doesn't approve maintenance. I had a late response to the initial TMS series and they denied me for 10 more sessions; I wrote them a fairly scathing appeal letter and ended up winning; I used to be a writer at least in mind. I never had any accolades but I liked what I wrote and wrote a lot. So I let them have it in the letter and got the 10 extra sessions but everything is still uncertain long term.

So now my doctor drops the bomb that after this, ECT is pretty much where we go from here if the TMS doesn't hold. I'm 25, and I'm worried both about destroying my brain with treatment as well as allowing this disorder to keep me from really doing or acheiving anything in what will amount to a short, unnecessarily painful life. 

Is there another place people go from here? Do you just get real into Buddhism or stoicism or some shit and white-knuckle it? I always feel like there's something I have to be missing, and yet... 

I almost feel bad relating my story at this stage, as I'm pretty sure I'm doing all the things one is supposed to do, and yet recovery feels as remote as ever. Even with ECT it's like, what's the fucking point, probably fry my brain for a 60% chance at remission, that may not hold either. In fact, some of the studies I'm reading say that I may even be less likely to experience remission from ECT based on my absent response to medications as well as the length of my episode. 

I thought I didn't have much to say but I guess I did. ",3
"I'm graduating from college this year, and I'm not ready. I study character technical direction at an art school, and my portfolio is not where it needs to be for job opportunities. I've already taken all the classes on that subject, so now I'll be spread too thin to work on side projects for my demo reel. 

My goal was to spend this break working on projects, improving, and learning. I spent plenty of time working on it, but I haven't been improving much. My sleep schedule started pretty healthy, but now the sun is rising when I finally fall asleep. I love watching movies (that's usually how I pass my time) but now it just seems unappealing. It's starting to take me hours to get out of bed, and my motivation is slipping away.

It's difficult to explain. I AM my thoughts, and my thoughts aren't irrational. I'm not depressed because my ""brain is lying to me"". Why do I sit around not doing anything? Because at my core, I don't feel an intrinsic desire to actually do something that doesn't bring me immediate physical pleasure. I don't reap the intangible rewards of completing goals or learning new things. I just don't care for it. That's a fact. I guess you could chalk me up to a whining child since I clearly don't want to push myself out of the mental rut, and with that I would agree. My values don't exist anymore. I'm a shell of a person and I don't care enough to change that. That's the thing everyone who wants to help just doesn't understand. They can't help me due to philosophical reasons. There's not a thing anyone could tell me that would make me feel as if anything mattered. There's not a thing I could tell myself to change that either. I could mechanically flip the switch on that thought so to speak, but I wouldn't FEEL it. Going with it trying to fake it till I DO feel it doesn't work because it's not GENUINE. That's the thing about major depression. It is a rational reaction and it is a genuine reaction. When someone comes out of it, they don't become ""themselves"" again; they were always themselves. They were able to flip the switch and FEEL it. This, I cannot do, and not because I think I can't.",5
"I've been on therapy and taking meds (Lexapro 10 mg). I've been having less mood swings, it's easier to sleep and I don't have crying breakdowns anymore. Still, when I think about death or not existing anymore, it seems like such a comforting thought, like a relief from all my pain and fears - even thought it's been less hard to deal with them, it's still hard. I don't think about it all the time, but when I do, the idea of no existence feels very tempting. When I wake up, I always ended up sleeping again or just staying more in bed. Even if I get out of bed and have an ok day and all, I still hesitate to do so, because hiding from the world in my bed feels like the best choice as a first thought, when I have just waken up. 
But it's still a better place than I was before, so I guess I've got that going for me. Better than nothing.

You only have a limited shared interests with one friend. There are so many times I get excited about something or want to discuss some things, but no one is there! People just keep baling on me because they think I'm being over-dramatic, exaggerating my situation and pain... I have health problems that causes mood issues with me and sometimes I can say things or act weird. I've explained this and at first people claim to understand and will stick with me but in the end they just ignore me or some stupid argument causes a rift! I'm sick of it!

I don't think that everyone has the same view that I just described, but for me, that is as I see it. I am alone, sad and depressed, just hoping that someone would see me, and say more than just a rushed hello as they walk by, back into the mob of the others who followed suit. But I guess that's too much to ask, why would anyone see me as someone to talk to, what could I possibly, say to make someone feel as if i haven't wasted their time?

I don't know how many other people feel the same, but I don't like to burden other with my problem, and that's why I've kept quiet and I know that by posting here I'm completely contradicting what I just said, but, I need help, and going to a forum of people that want to give their help willingly doesn't make me feel like as much of a burden, I hope whoever is reading this shares similar views.

"Back in the middle of September, I [20M] tried to kill myself. Had everything sorted out, was in a good enough location, and had a loaded shotgun pressed up in my mouth. I was ready to go, and I tried for hours to just pull the damn trigger but i couldn't do it.

Before this, I cried often and felt sad a lot, but nowadays I don't feel anything and have no drive to do anything. For almost two weeks I've done nothing but browse youtube and reddit for at least 12 hours a day, and I hardly ever move. Everything is just so exhausting and uninteresting. And this shit is just wearing me down. I really don't want to live anymore. I have nothing to live for anymore...no friends/relationships, not good at anything, don't really have hobbies, just nothing.

I really wish I had just offed myself when I had the chance...now I'm going to have to find a new way out. Shooting myself was just too difficult...I'm definitely going to need liquor next time to push me over that final edge. I'm not strong enough to end it, but I have to.",5

I moved back in with my parents and have had no energy or motivation to move forward with my life. I'm also 29 so this is pathetic. I feel guilty for having depression because I should be far beyond this girl at this point but even with therapy and trying meds I cannot get my shit together. I almost feel as if I'm making all this shit up at this point. Like my mood is permanently fucked up and my outlook is shit. I am really tired of this. 

Also, nobody ever move to central PA if you have depression. ",4
"I guess I'll start off by saying that I've been dealing with depression about eight years. It has peaked in the past, but I'd say I've been mostly positive since then. About one or two days out of every month it hits me with reminders that it's still there.


Today is one of those days. I woke up next to my girlfriend (who I absolutely love) and I just feel like I'm always worrying about doing/saying the right thing.  When something bothers me, I tell her. No matter how small it may seem. It just helps me get things off my chest and out of my mind. She hates when I do this, because she thinks I'm trying to pick a fight, and argue over something so meaningless. She tells me if roles were reversed, these things wouldn't bother her. 


So how do I even deal with these thoughts? I can't just hold them back, because then it's obvious something is on my mind. I can't just push it out of my mind by rationalizing it, because I'm constantly worrying. I also feel like there are so many guys that would love to have her. I think if I fuck up and constantly bug her about things, that she'll be closer to the door.  


I guess I'm just feeling shitty today and I wish I could just change it.  Hope all of you are trying to stay positive as well.",4
"I've always had an insecurity and inferior complex when it comes to my definition of success. That depression is coming back to me again and I need to let out what is bothering me.

I'm seeing people younger than me get into better schools than me in harder subjects that I couldn't handle. I see people moving on much farther ahead and doing things that I haven't been able to do.

I wish God could have just given me more blessings. At least have let me go to UCLA regardless of major.

And yet I know that I'm so lazy and not a hard worker and I can't tell you if it's my ADHD or it's actually just me. I feel like I should know better but I don't.

I feel like what is easy for others is hard for myself but other people can be so harsh and just say that it's all in your head...if you just worked hard and started just focusing on your goal then things would move forward. They make it sound so easy...and I feel like it's supposed to be easy to do but I just can't do it. And I can't decide if it's just me who thinks its hard or if it's just honestly hard for me.",5

I'll stomp on them, crush them with my gloved hands, and my personal favorite, after they manage to climb onto me and bite me... Is to smack them lightly, enough to cripple and disorient, then I pull them apart, limb from limb... All the while asking it, ""how does it feel to be the one getting hurt?""

"This might end up sounding like a bunch of rambling but I am tired and have to get this off my chest to someone else. 

The last few months have been really rough. Between a very serious likelihood that I am going to have to drop out of grad school because of a stupid error on my part, money issues, and just struggling with Seasonal Affect Disorder, this is the lowest I have ever been. . 

Getting the ""blues"" during the winter time for me is normal and I usually don't say anything to anyone but this year has been so so bad. Up until now, I haven't seriously felt the ""Things would be better without me"" feeling before and it scared the shit out of. I was driving in car and I had a very real moment of not wanting to hit the brakes as I pulled up to the stop sign.. I am still scared about how bad I was feeling and could feel again. Honestly, on top of the fear and sadness, I feel a lot of shame for being so bummed out and having a thought like that. 

I struggled with whether or not to tell anyone. I was really ashamed with how I felt. I have a degree in Psych and I work in Mental Health so I have given the ""who to talk to/numbers to call"" speech more times than I can count but I was/am scared to admit that I might need it. It took me a couple of days but I did end up telling my boyfriend. I don't think that I can talk to my parents/family about how I am feeling yet. .Just a different type of relationship with them but I told him. It was incredibly scary and I don't think I have ever felt more ashamed/scared to say something in my life. I couldn't outright say that I wanted to die in that moment but I told him how I felt and he seemed to understand. He made sure to do the good boyfriend/person thing. . Was very understanding/supportive but made sure that I knew I needed to tell him or someone if I was that sad or felt that way again. 

I am not saying that saying something made the depression any less or easier but i can say that telling him was a lot more freeing than I thought. I know that he has my back and is watching to catch me if I fall back into feeling like I wanted to hurt myself or something like that. I am glad I did it. ",2

"That's it. This isn't a new year's resolution because that shit is nonsense people tell themselves to feel better. I'm GOING to beat this shit. The last month I can confidently say has been THE WORST  month of my life and I have been through A LOT OF SHIT during the last 27 years of my existence. At least during those times, I wasn't depressed (somehow). 

I know what I need to do. I need to find a therapist who understands what I'm going through. I must have been chipping away at a mental wall I built up or something all this time because it finally came crashing down after a series of thoughts and I NEED to tell someone about it. Someone I can trust. The fact that the simple thought of it gives me hope and makes me feel better means I know I'm right. 

I don't think it's a chemical issue in my case. It's a cyclical one, only eased when I drink several cans of beer before inevitably passing out since otherwise I WILL be up all night - no question. For the first time in my life I am ""looking more forward to"" (phrase used loosely since there aren't many things I can truly enjoy lately) work and this annoying festive vacation to end because I won't be alone with my thoughts. 

I WILL beat this. I HAVE to. And to anyone reading this post who feels the same way you CAN too. Sometimes, there are some things in life we just can't beat alone. ",4
"Shorter but less detailed version at the bottom...

Useless backstory info: I'm a 17 yro closeted bisexual (mostly on the gay side) teen in the homophobic south. That's not completely my problem. Recently I've been feeling so numb to life and it's to the point where I don't see the point in living anymore. Thing is I'm afraid of dying. For a long time now I've been feeling alone and like I have no one in this life. People are the only thing that make life worth living. I'm not a shy or awkward guy but at this point I don't have many friends in my life. Awhile ago due to uncanny luck I started working at the same job as a guy that I've liked since nineth grade. We also take classes together this year. I don't know what I did but we somehow clicked and became close friends (not THE closest but close). He's a feminine guy so there was a time when I thought he felt the same way but do to his homophobic remarks about other gay people and him showing me a lot of the messages from girls he's been with (the normal guy thing I assume) I made an executive decision to back off of him in that way. However at this point in my life he is one of the only friends that I got and also (again despite us not being that close) the best friend I've got so I really don't wanna lose him. It feels like lately we've been drifting apart despite my absolute best effort to be more talkative, be funnier, and at some times pulling away do to me feeling that I've been coming on too strong. Losing him is my worst fear in the world. Not only is he the best friend I have rn but he's also a guy that I've liked for a long time now. It's like because of my apathy towards life, my loneliness, and my lust for him combined he's subliminally become my reason for living. I've been depressed for a while now and it's a sad thing when you at an age as young as 13 are trying to decide what song you're gonna kill yourself to. The only reason I'm still here today is because I promised myself that I would at least wait until the age of 27 to see if the shit about life getting better is true or not and I chose 27 because of Kurt Cobain. If I'm gonna die why not die with an artistic aesthetic in mind. However everyday I feel worse and worse and I thank my mom for being a responsible one and hiding her gun because idk if I'd be here today. With all that being said my question is this: Should I ask my mom to see a therapist/ psychologist or whatever? The reason I have to ask is because I fear my mom asking me and forcing me to tell her what I'm so upset about and I also fear not knowing what to tell the therapist and just wasting time and money or speaking too much and ending up in some kinda mental hospital. The worst part about all of this is feeling like I don't even have anyone (irl) to express my feelings of sadness to. I just feel like a dog in a cage and all I ever do is go to school, work, the come home and go to bed and I don't know what to do anymore. Am I just gonna be another gay statistic.

Short Version (less details): 
I'm a southern bisexual but mostly gay kid who's felt extremely lonely to the point of suicide for a long time now. I randomly by some stroke of luck became friends with a feminine guy who I've been enthralled with feeling for since 9th grade but found out he was straight. We're slowly losing our bond and I don't know what I'll do without him considering he is my only good friend at all rn. I'm feeling lonely, depressed and suicidal rn so should I ask my mom to see a therapist?

I may post this in more than one place btw.",5
"Last year had been pretty rough for me. Mostly it's the crippling depression and anxiety I'm struggling with, there were ups and downs and I'm surviving. Though recently I've felt like there were a lot of good things happening in 2017, that 2017 was actually a pretty good year.

I decided to spend my night alone in my room because I need a rest from spending my nights with meaningless distractions. Basically just gonna have a nice sleep at 10pm after writing a resolution letter for my future self. 

But boy I'm still widely awake by now. Now I'm alone, no one seems to care about me, not even my family. I don't have any friends. My eyes are super red right now.

"Organizing my thoughts enough to make this make sense is difficult.

I have a bad habit of trying to smoke and work my time away, because on the clock is the only time that I'm not exhausted and angry. Neither of my two current jobs keep me busy enough, so I've started searching for a third. I've stopped smoking weed for the search, and now the depression is deepening again.

The smallest things make me want to rage endlessly, destroying everything around me, but I don't even have the energy to waste on being angry. I've never let myself consider suicide or self harm, so I'm stuck in a shitty nihilistic spiral of hating to live and living to hate.

I feel like my only desires are to pass the time until I can die without hurting my loved ones, and to minimize any negative impact I may have on those around me along the way. I figure if I can't be happy, I might as well not bring others down.

I am fourteen years old.
About half a year ago I was in the worst possible part of my life
... until now I feel.
I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and OCD, I was hospitalized for a few suicide attempts. 
Back then I used to feel horrible. I wanted to die.
When I was hospitalized I met this girl. I thought she was the most beautiful human being.
We talked one day, and I quickly found out, that she was the most beautiful human being inside and out.

Fast forward a few months.
We've been talking quite a lot, and I've gotten to know her.
I felt like she was losing interest in talking to me, if I would not start the conversation there wouldn't be a conversation at all, and so I decided to ask her out. We went to the city and just walked and talked for three hours. It was the best day of my life. She seemed so glad to see me, and I felt like she had a really good time.
The next day it went back to normal, she doesn't really answer me, if I talk to her.
I'm so scared, that she has completely lost interest in me and my existence, and I'm not sure what to do...",4
"I'm a 22 y/o woman almost finished with my TMS therapy for my MDD. I've definitely felt the dip, and things have gotten so much better over the past few weeks.
The issue I'm having though is that I feel like a completely different person. In some ways it's good, but I feel like I'm re-learning how to live. Some of my interests have changed, things physically feel different, I don't feel as invested in my relationships, and in a strange way I miss my depression because it was like a comforting imaginary friend that was always there. I'm very happy for the most part, and remission has been an awesome experience, but it's also terrifying.

"I moved to a new city away from my family and friends and ex-SO for the greatest job opportunity I could ask for right out of college. And somewhere along the line of my first real week of days off, I realized that all I did was work and I was just curled up in bed every second I was not working. I've thrown myself into a job so completely that I didn't even realize I stopped eating and slept too much. Now I'm back at work, and I didn't realize how lonely I felt being so far away from everyone I ever cared for. It's just a part of growing up, right?

i don't know if it's wellbutrin (which i was prescribed like 4 weeks ago) or just me or something but like
i've been so fucking weak and shaky. my hands are shaking like i have fucking parkinson's and i have zero appetite whatsoever. one day last week i spent the entire night hallucinating shadows and feeling extremely paranoid. i've been having like, really vivid dreams when i close my eyes even if i'm awake, it's really weird. and one of these vivid awake dreams was an extremely realistic third person view of me hanging myself with a belt in my closet and i'm not even fucking suicidal so i don't know 

what the fuck is going on
i wanted to call my doctor but they're fucking closed
i don't know if i should keep toughing it out expecting it to get better or if i should just stop taking it i have no fucking clue
cuz i was really excited at the idea that it would work for me :(


edit: i've literally had no energy for the past 3 days but all of the sudden like 10 mins after writing this post i felt myself feel really like fired up and ready to do shit kinda like adderall but less powerful ahhhhh",3
"NOTE: I used this Instagram account to post a meme, and did not assume the identity of anyone else nor did I use any photos of people.

-----

I have an interest in this guy, so I decided to follow his Instagram with a fake meme account one I made. I don't know why I didn't make a real one in retrospect, but I'm not going to take the chance of making a second one with my true identity because that would look even more suspicious, right?

I see why I stay away from social media. I made a decision that probably made him view me as a creep.

I created an instagram account, and tried to post some jokes, because I wanted him to think I was funny. It was my attempt at communication, under disguise. It was stupid in retrospect and I won't ever do it again. But honestly, I want to know what I can do to fix this, because I don't want him to view me in a weird way. I just wanted to be closer to him.

I'm depressed on this issue.",4

"Hey guys. This might sound funny to you (it sounds funny even to me lol), but i'm really ashamed of my past.

I'm 17 year old, and about 5 months ago I shaved my head. Previously, I had mid-sized hair and I was a cute guy, but when I cut my hair I looked really, really bad. Some people even couldn't recognise me. But that's not everything - one day I got drunk with my friend and we shaved the ends of our eyebrows (yeah, we really did it), so I looked like a serial killer or a pedophile... I literally wanted to cut my whole head next morning.

Few days later, I was at brother's birthday party and I took some photos with him and his friends, and one of the guys posted the photo of us on facebook. He didn't tag me, but he tagged my friend, who is in my class. He even put a cover photo with me and some other guys... 

Now, here comes the real problem...

A few weeks ago, I met a girl through one of my classmates (not the one I mentioned before), and now we're in relationship. Now, I'm scared that he could maybe tell her about my hair-shaving, or that my girlfriend could find my bald photos (4 of them) on facebook.

Yes, I know this is a really funny and strange story, but I don't know how to deal with this... I'm thinking about this whole day. That simply kills me, because she'll probably find them one day (and maybe even break up with me), and I don't know how should i react...

"Finally went to the doc after being in a nine month low, the lowest I've been in years. I started meds and my doc just upped them after my three week check up. She also gave me a pill to stop panic attacks. 

I thought I was making strides forward. Today my dad's girlfriend, a very nice and loving woman, died. She died the exact same way my mom died almost exactly six years later. 

I remained calm for him, but I'm having a terribly hard time. I'm just numb. I just don't fucking understand. Death just follows me. 

I don't know what to do. My boss told me to take tomorrow off. My dad lives 3 hours away and is snowed in so I can't really even go visit him. 
I'm drowning. ",3
"I'm really depressed. There's no one here to help me or to force me to get up. I've been in bed for a few days, only getting up to go to the toilet and refill my water. I haven't had any energy to make food so I've not eaten in 4 days. Just water. 

This is a particularly bad period, but even when it's better, it's still tough. I was randomly googling things like ""how to survive when you're depressed"" and one of the common pieces of advice is to be kind to yourself and accept that you're not operating at your normal capacity.

The problem is, if I'm operating only on 20% capacity, what do I do when my life is demanding at least 60%. I have so many things I haven't done. I missed a doctor's appointment yesterday, I ignored a friend's invitation today, my credit card is due to be paid in a week and even though I have the money to pay it, I just haven't yet. My fridge is completely empty aside from food that is two weeks bad. I haven't showered in 5 days. I have a massive laundry pile to do.

None of these things are unmanageable on their own, but there's just so much that I feel I can't do. How can I even begin to get help when I'm this bad? It feels like I've already reached my limit just refilling my water and going to bed.

How do I survive, in practice, when it's taking all my willpower to simply not kill myself? The guides online say to recognise the small achievements. What do you do when staying in bed and not killing yourself is an achievement? It might be admirable from some perspectives, but the world doesn't stop for chronically ill people.",5
I did something really stupid cause i panicked and swerved into another car. I've had nightmares of this scenario happening. Why can't I do anything right? I hate existing so much. I hate myself.

"Im shocked. I didnt realize how much I had lost. Im not thin by any means, but... Im not really that fat anymore. I think im one of the healthiest people in my family (though most of them are obese or suffer eating disorders). Ive gotten so used to my diet, but now I need to maintain what I have. Losing much more would affect me negatively... But it makes me sad that I still dont like my appearence.

I expected I would just suddenly find myself attractive if I hit the right weight, but I still dont. I dont know how to feel about it... I know I should be happy that Ive fulfilled something ive been working on for 3 years, but I still dont feel good enough. Hard to believe people when they say you look good when you cant even get a girlfriend, you know? Guess that counts as a rant. I dunno.",0
"Hello everyone.

I've never actually reached out about my wellbeing before and don't really know how to, so I guess I'm just going to lay it all out on the table.

I'm 24 and I graduated college about three weeks ago, and I think there may be some thing or things wrong with me that I was ignoring as I gritted my teeth through my generally painful and unrewarding five-and-a-half year college experience. To keep things abbreviated, all I'll say here is that during that short time I had three major medical catastrophes (one of which will persist for the rest of my life), I was stalked for 7 months at one point, lived with an abusive couple, and had several family deaths. All of these negative stimuli gave me the opportunity to hand-wave my mental health difficulties as par for the course. It almost goes without saying, but my GPA was decimated by these experiences (my college has a terrible medical withdrawal system and as a result I have never taken any medical leave).

I would say I was ""doing well"" during my last two semesters (although my definition of doing well still involves a constant fog of anxiety and sleep issues); I was pursuing my interests relatively aggressively, making probably a B+ average in my classes, exercising 3x/week (this stopped a couple months ago), etc. During my final semester I was even working two part time jobs while taking classes. I still had these constant discomforts that I chalked up to school and proximity to recent hardship, but now after a few weeks of unemployment and no school I'm starting to think I'm incapable of enjoying myself in a healthy way (or at all really).

I have diagnosed ADHD and have always struggled in school, but in the last three years have really had to teach myself how to learn and devote myself to my studies. As a result I have learned a lot, but I also have lost a lot of my sense of identity. I haven't had a girlfriend since I was 17, and have only been on one date in the intervening time. Additionally I have dropped essentially all of my hobbies, and my latent avoidant behaviors that have always subverted all of my efforts have become more and more disruptive. For instance, just tonight (it's 3:30AM where I live for context) I spent two and a half hours in my room while uncomfortably hungry in order to avoid interacting with my room mates (with whom I have no problems or stresses). After two hours of waiting, I compromised by grabbing a protein shaker and just walking to the kitchen while nobody was looking, rinsing it out, then making a protein shake with milk from my mini fridge in my room. It may seem like a silly example, but this kind of thing is reflected in every aspect of my life and I can't keep living this way.

For the last seven years (at least), I have also been bothered by a weird intrusive tick that I'm deeply ashamed of. I call it a tick, because it's not really a thought. It makes me cringe to even write it out, but for the longest time as I go about my daily forgettable tasks whenever I'm alone (or I'm at work and think I'm alone) I'll just mutter to myself some variation of ""I'm going to kill myself"", ""I'm going to get out of here"", or ""I'm going to wake up."" It's a lot like a hiccup; it comes out quickly and unexpectedly to the point where I can't even stop it until halfway through the sentence, and even then it's like cutting off a stream of piss (it basically requires me to hold my breath in the middle of a sentence). One of my deepest fears is that someone I know will hear me saying these things one day, although at this point it seems almost impossible that nobody has yet. I've only told two people in my life about these things, and I consider both of those conversations a major life event; they were about four years apart.

All of these problems seem to worsen when my sleep is bad, and my sleep is always bad. I have utterly given up on being a well rested person and am a hostage to the vicious whims of my body clock. Now that I am not forced to wake up early, it's gotten even worse. I can't bring myself to even start projects that I'd been telling myself I was only putting off for school. I am hanging out with friends, but still constantly wonder why I am not doing more with my time, or at the very least actually enjoying myself in my leisure. School and work were hell, but free time is suffocating. I don't really understand why my life has come to be this way, but this seems to be the way that it is.

I'm worried that I might be about to enter (or maybe already in the midst of) a shame induced downward spiral. I'm not normally the type to do hard drugs, but in the last two and a half weeks I've dropped acid five times. This doesn't seem to be part of the problem however; I'm weirdly unaffected by these trips and am not having negative experiences from them (although I think I'm done for now). Simultaneously, my family is falling apart and my parents are talking about divorce over my sister's out of control decisions. Among my family and friends (most of whom also struggle with mild to serious mental instability), I am usually considered the one who ""has it together."" This is part of the reason that I have never sought professional help, along with a strong, quiet kind of discouragement of that sort of thing from my family and society as a whole.

From the day I finished my last exam I've felt this indescribable, seeping apathy. I don't know how it's possible to feel apathetic and panicked at the same time, but I seem to have pulled it off. Maybe it's more like paralysis. In any case, I can't seem to do anything constructive, I haven't been exercising, I haven't been looking for work (I applied for hundreds of jobs over the last semester), I have neither done anything stressful nor for even one minute felt relaxed. I'm always surprised when I am hungry, but if I really scrutinize my day will often find that I haven't eaten for 18+ hours. The worst thing is the underlying truth that nothing has changed and I was always like this. I can't believe I graduated at all.

I have enough money to last three months in my current living situation. In two weeks, I'm going to start applying to food service jobs. Although I have a BS in computer science, I feel that at this time in my life I am not cut out for a real job or really capable of contributing to anything, but I'm such a leech that I'll continue pursuing a career-type job while working in food service anyway.

**TLDR**

I guess I'll wrap up by saying what I meant to say in the first place: I'm worried about my life. I can't remember the last time I really enjoyed something, and I am incapable of pursuing things that will make my life better. I'm afraid that my poor self esteem and self hatred will lead me to start making actively self-destructive decisions, and I don't really know where that path will end because I can't tell the difference between misery and happiness anymore. I don't know what to do about any of these things and honestly I can't see how posting this will help either, but I feel like I need to do something and I guess this is something.",3
"Just a sense of impending doom, this year is going to be shit. I felt the same last year and I was right, 2016 was awful.

"I finally went out to do something with my few friends. I've had a crush on one of them for at least 3 years and one of my other friends that knew was also asking a girl out there and said I should ask the one I liked as well. 

I was really scared because I've never had a girlfriend and the one time I asked someone I was rejected and I'm terrible at speaking to people and I just freeze up when I get nervous which was definitely happening now. I tried to talk to her and of course I froze up and made everything awkward and ruined everything. 

Every time I try to do something I screw it up. I feel like I'm not good at anything. My dad and step-mom don't take me seriously. They say I'm lazy because I never do anything but I'm afraid because every time I leave my room I mess something up. I can't make food, can't socialize, video games aren't fun to me anymore because I hate playing alone, I tried skating but I don't have money to buy new equipment and all I have is a tiny Penny board that my feet are too big for, my family expects me to have high grades because I used too be considered the smart one but my grades have fallen so now the one thing I was considered good at is gone and I keep disappointing everyone, the one family member I have that truly loves me is in prison because of an assault charge and everyone in my family hates her, and now I've probably lost another one of my few friends because I can't do anything right.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't really want to live but I know I'm not going to commit suicide. I've thought about it but I'm too scared and I don't want to hurt my mom more than she already is. I don't know why I'm posting this. My phone's dead and my charger barely works so I was sitting silently on my computer browsing Reddit and decided to rant for no reason. Sorry.",4

"Depression has been with me for about 30 years. 2017 was probably my hardest year. I was at a point where I was depressed, anxious, and desperate. I was so scared and had no idea what to do that I called 911. It was the best thing I ever did. I spent time focusing on me. Not what society expects. I always had a tiny flicker of hope that kept telling me tomorrow will come. It's not much but know with every morning the bright warm sun will rise, even if behind clouds, and you deserve to feel it. You are heard. You are never alone. ",3
"I made posts about me not wanting to go to school, but I grew lady balls and put on my happy mask and went. 

just a side note that during the break I decided I was tired of feeling the way I've been feeling the whole school year and to deal with my insecurities. I have a big fear of being alone and i tend to depend my happiness on people. So to start I cut toxic people off and limited my phone use. I got off my other friends backs and continued to develop a friendship that's been blooming. I already start to feel better about myself.

So I quit a sport and I lost friends. I was so upset because I was alone again and started to resent other people that seemingly had a better life. But I realized I shouldn't beg people to stay in my life and if they want to leave they can. Plus everybody isn't perfect, and the comparing yourself to others just makes you more unhappy with yourself. People come in and out of your life as well, because everyone has their own life to live ya know? 

But anyway I got switched to new class today and it turned out I know everyone that sits at my table from past school years. I was so happy to be presented with the opportunity to make new friendships. Lunch kind of sucked bc I cut one girl off and she didn't sit with me but I discovered another developing friendship switched classes and had the same lunch. Lucky me! 

In the morning I used to freak out because I had no place or group to sit with due to the sport being early in the morning. So I decided to deal with it and sat by myself in the library until 1st period started. It helped me realize that my social anxiety is just me and nobody really gives af if you are by yourself minding your business. Same with other class periods where I don't have close enough friends. 

On top of this, I got my work schedule and I'm working a lot this week so I can stay busy. It's like my life is getting back together and I'm trying to stay as positive as possible. I just wanted people to see especially if you're in high school that school isn't the devil you see it to be. 

I'm thankful for this sub and for the redditors that have given me advice. I realize that everyone has ups and downs, nobody is perfect and everyone has insecurities. Even when everything is at its worst there's always something good in your life, even if it's that you woke up today :) ",2

"Don't get me wrong, I'm not suicidal. I'm far too cowardly to actually kill myself. I'm just tired of existing. I just wish there was some way I could just stop existing, without actually having to kill myself. I'm sad all the time, and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of pretending to be okay, because if I don't then I get accused of attention seeking. I can't stand being alive anymore. I'm tired, mentally and physically, and I don't know how to handle it anymore.

Edit: Thank you so much to everyone who commented with advice and offers to listen. It means so much to me and, I'm sure, so many others who feel the same way. To all those who commented saying they relate and talking about feeling suicidal, I'm not a certified therapist, but I'm willing to listen if you want to talk about it. I'm just a PM away to anyone who wants to talk. I'll listen. Thank you all for making me feel less alone, and slightly more normal for a while.",5
"I invited my friend Ryan to brunch yesterday since it had been a while since I saw him and I wanted to catch up. He is 16 and a junior in high school; I'm 17 and a senior in high school. Things were going great until he suggested we go hang out at my house. I drove him over and we went into my room. There was only one chair at my desk seeing as I'm usually the only one in my room so he sat on my lap - he is bi and I am gay so we're both ok with that. Then I started to go for his crotch and he told me to knock it off. I stopped for a while but then I went back in again, eventually getting all the way under his pants. A few minutes later he mentioned he had plans so I drove him back to his house and we went our separate ways. 

I just can't fathom how I could possibly do something like that. It was like my hormones just completely controlled me and my brain just turned off. What kind of person attacks their friend like that? And to top it off, I knew he had feelings for a girl at the time so i probably just fucked up their relationship. What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't normally have a high sex drive either. 

I feel so scared and guilty and I just want him to be OK. I don't give a shit about myself anymore. Now I understand why people self harm. ",4

"I apologize for the long/whiny post but I need to vent.  Hopefully this helps clear my head so I can get some sleep tonight. 

About a week ago I was talking with a friend (I will call him Derek) and the topic of New Year's came up. I told Derek that I did not have any plans at which point his girlfriend (Kim) suggested that I join them on a trip up north to hang out with her friend (Sara), whom Kim tried to set me up with about a year ago but I was just not in a good place to start dating and within a few weeks she was dating someone else (Ken).  At this time Derek let me know that Kim wanted to set us up again. I recently, about three weeks ago, I got the dreaded ""I just want to be friends"" from another woman that I had been hanging out with for a little over a month.  This made me a little hesitant since it had not been too long since the rejection, but I agreed to go.  The plan was to go up Sunday afternoon, stay the night at Sara's, and leave Monday morning.

Fast forward to the Sunday night and we are at a house part hosted by one of Sara's friends.  It is still early and I find myself talking with Kim at the party, Kim is asking me if I am interested in Sara and I tell her I am.  She gets a huge smile on her face as she was talking with Sara earlier and she was interested in me.  At this point my head is going crazy, I am probably the happiest I have been in years, I start to think finally something good is happening.  Midnight comes around and Sara and I are standing next to each other, the countdown ends and for some reason I cannot pull the trigger and kiss her.  I am an idiot. 

Of course, the party continues and I go outside with Derek to smoke a cigarette (cope) thinking that I blew it with this awesome girl.  We come back in and mingle with the other party-goers.  I find myself talking with Sara alone, we talk for a while and then in the middle of our conversation she leans in a kisses me.  I am back on cloud nine, I didn't screw this up.  It is about 1:00 AM now and we head out as Sara has to be to work at 5:00 AM.  

We get back to Sara's place and start getting ready for bed, I am in Sara's room with her as Kim and Derek climb onto the air mattress in the living room, the original sleeping arrangements were for Kim to sleep in Sara's room on an air mattress and Derek and I were to sleep on a couch and air mattress in the living room.  So there Sara and I are sitting on her bed and we say goodnight, and she looks at the air mattress that was setup on her floor.  I get the hint and climb in, I don't think too much of it as this is the first night that we have really hung out and the fact that she has to wake up in 2.5 hours.

The next morning; Kim, Derek, and I wake up and clean up Sara's house.  We decide that we should grab some breakfast before heading home, Kim texts Sara to see if she would like us to bring her anything which she does.  It dawns on me that in all of the excitement of the night I never asked Sara for her number, I am determined to get it before leaving.  We get to Sara's office and head in, she is there with one other coworker.  As we say our goodbyes she hugs me and then as I am about to ask for her number someone says something to her and she looks away.  I lose all the confidence that I had to ask and leave.  

The drive home is hell, all I can think about is how I missed my chance after what was probably the best night off my life in 10 years.  Kim drops Derek and myself off at Derek's and he asks me why I didn't ask her for her number I tell him that I didn't want to ask in front of her coworker, which is half true.  He says that he will talk to Kim who will in turn talk to Sara and send me her number.  I hate this as it is like I am back in high school but it is the only option I have.  
I do not hear back from Derek on Monday night and my head goes straight to the worse possible reason, Sara wants nothing to do with me.  I talk myself down from that scenario as Derek and I had made plans for Tuesday.  Tuesday comes around and Derek and I hang out, I do not bring up anything with Sara the entire time until it is time to leave.  I ask Derek if Kim had talked to her and he breaks the news; Ken, Sara's ex, is moving back to town.  This is information that Kim knew prior to inviting me, but she does not want Sara to get back together with Ken so she was hoping that we would hit it off and that she would not want to get back with her ex.  


So now here I am, feeling awful, rejected two times in a month.  How could something be going so right and end so abruptly?  I am not sure if Sara wants to get back together with her ex or as I was told her ex coming back to town is just messing with her head and she doesn't want to get hurt again.  Kim and Derek said that they would talk with her and let me know but now I feel like I shouldn't even try anymore, it always ends the same.",4

"For the past few days, I've been miserable. Hit a new low kinda miserable. My parents snapped at me, not knowing so. They threatened to kick me out and so i just walked out. Grabbed my pack and just ran. They tried to bring me back. T'was a whole chase scene with jumping over walls and shet. 

But i couldn't. After however many hours, I went back. I never got anything when I returned but a single lecture about how nobody is gonna care if I do it again bc I'm 19. They're probably right.

Word travels fast in my family, and I believe I've ruined New Years for everyone. I dont want to face everyone anymore. None of them understand what I'm going through. I have no friends to talk to anymore. My brother and sister ignore me and dont like me. My parents also ignore what I'm going through and suggest that I shouldnt be depressed bc theyre depressed even more. All my aunts and uncles who think they help say that too. 

Im rambling at this point...

Right now, im laying in my bed, legs sore, body numb, and drowning in despair. I dont know where to go. I want to end it but im afraid to. I want leave but i dont know where to go. And even if i do, i wont know how to start my life back again and for that, I'm scared. Even so, im considering doing things i would never have done before.

"Hey. Excuse my incoming rant, I just feel like I have to get a few things off my chest or they will crush me for good and I have never done this before. Also excuse my English - I am prone to not paying attention to the grammar when I get long-winded.

What a year this was. Well, not for me but for pretty much everyone else I know. Success just can't stop coming for them. Pretty much everyone is doing great, even the people about which I used to think that they would end up in my current situation. And then there is me, in all of my useless, depressed self, wallowing in my self-inflicted misery. The only things that were enjoyable to me happened on a macro scale so they didn't really affect my personal actual situation at all.

I'm 24, still living with my parents and lonelier than ever before. I spend most of my days at home, mostly reading and watching useless crap on the internet. I read books too, but not as many as I used to. I've got attention issues. 10 years ago I could tear through a 600 pages long book in a day, today I can barely go for 15 minutes before I feel like I have to do something else (like refreshing a webpage and seeing that nothing has happened) and then have a hard time coming back to whatever I was doing. I can still read fast but I feel like I've become addicted to the ever-avaiable constant stream of shallow information that is so typical for this day and age - I think I know more the American electoral system now than I have ever wanted to know even though I live half a world away. Still, I've read pretty much through the entire Western canon over the last few years, trying to find answers... to anything with nothing coming out of it.

I procrastinate... a lot. It causes issues at the uni where I have been behind on pretty much every deadline I've ever gotten and considering what I've been told about my latest paper I may not even be able to finish it. But the degree I am trying to get is useless anyway (I chose it a few years ago in a bout of depression after I quit my original pursuit of some economics degree), so it probably doesn't matter anyway. The worst thing is that I think that I actually have a good work ethic when I really set my mind to something, but I hardly ever actually get to that point and I have a hard time staying in it because my mind just goes somewhere else. I've tried to write a book - I think I am pretty good with words, at least in my native language, and I thought it would offer me some more opportunities for escapism (that's pretty much the only peace I get these days). I got really excited, spend 3 weeks on it... and yet once I stopped some 30k words in, I have been having a hard time getting back, even though I have the whole thing in my head.

Those two issues are probably aided by thyroid problems. A doc told me two or three years ago that I should see a specialist because my thyroid apparently isn't working exactly as it should. I've ignored that advice and now I fear going to see a doctor because they will shit on me for neglecting the issue. I think it's just an irrational fear of criticism and denial. I know that I should do it and yet I can't bring myself to it. I've been delaying and delaying, always putting it in the ""after that"" spot. I am an idiot. Telling myself that I am an idiot does not really help though.

I've got communication issues too. Had them for a long time. I was bullied a bit at school when I was like 12 but while I thought for a longest time that it didn't affect me (I've become friends with all those people overtime), it probably ended up affecting me more than I thought it would. It certainly put a dent into my school performance, even though that was probably paired with the fact that I did not have learn anything for my first 6-7 years at school because all that stuff was too easy for me and so I never really learned how to learn, if you know what I mean.

The worst thing is that I feel like there is no reason for me to not live a normal life. I am clever... heck, my intelligence is well above average according to everything I have ever been told. I look normal - I think I have a pretty face, pretty green eyes and nice hair and all that. My height ended up average, close to 6 feet, even though my paediatrician has always said I'd turn out 5'5-6 at best. I am bit underweight and have problems putting on weight (thyroid again?), but that's probably the only issue with my appearance. I was surprised to discover that my voice is kinda whiny a few years ago, but I don't think it's that bad.

And yet I feel like I repulse people. I've never had a girlfriend. Those few girls I liked never... really paid attention to me, even though I was nice to them and they were nice to me... I should've probably been more assertive but I've always feared the embarassment of bad social experience. I've pretty much stopped trying over the years. Also, I don't remember any girl ever trying to get me and if any did, I remain completely blind to it to this day. As I said, I've eventually become friends with most people around me but those relationships were always pretty shallow. I've had maybe two really good friends over the last 10 years (mind you, hardly the ""best friend"" category) but even they have been gradually drifting out of my life. I can't really fault them for that as they have their own exciting lives and I have almost nothing to offer in exchange for friendship... they've certainly tried to get me out of my shell (and still do from time to time) and I will remain grateful for that.

Last summer I got a work in a warehouse. Just wanted to make some quick buck and I think manual job suits me because my mind can shut off and go to its own place without any consequences. I did the job well, all eager and active and got on a good raport with some co-workers. And yet after a few weeks they started telling me that there were no hours avaiable for me even though they told me there would be hours for several months when they hired me. Hell, they even hired more people after me and those were still coming to work. I've checked in a few more times after that and all I got were weird faces and evasive answers so I stopped. To this day I don't know what I did wrong. It's a small episode but it's pretty indicative of the rest of my life... I don't know what I did wrong and yet people never really connected with me on a deeper level so I drifted away from them as they did from me.

I should add that my parents fight a lot... have been fighting for 15 years. It's a real wonder that nobody ever got hurt. My mom's got anxiety and a phobia from dirt and diseases so she gets panic attacks basically all the time. It took my dad years to become mindful of that and the relationship has gone really sour over that time. Today they just fight over everything, even the smallest, stupidiest things, like who is going to cook a dinner. That has probably affected me too when it comes to interpersonal relationships... ""is this what I am going to get if I get a girlfriend? That's not worth it.""

I think I am getting to the end of this. I feel like I am missing some things I wanted to say, but I am glad that I've got at least this out of me. Happy New Year and let's hope the things get better.",3

"This is the most incredibly frustrating and scary time of my life. I have no clue what to think. I'm about to start my second semester at college. I barely made it through the first one. I had been on Zoloft 50mg and even got down to 25 mg for anxiety and depression. But during the later months of the semester of college. I got hit like a truck. I thought I was doing fine and adapting. But I guess not. I woke up feeling ""off"" and had acute anxious feelings about my well being and mental health. I've never really felt better. I feel empty. Lonely. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist  at school, and we upped my Zoloft to 150 mg with not much change in my mood. So now I'm on 100 mg of pristiq and have yet to witness any change. It's like this huge jumbled mess of what I call brain fog, anxiety, existential worry ( I just took two philosophy courses and have always been worried about life and death and religion), and depression. I'm so scared and sad. I'm trying to get better. It's like I'm trapped in my own mind. I dont want to drop college because I know it will hurt my future. I don't know why all of this happened so suddenly. It's like everything is contributing to everything else. I just want to feel better. ",3
"Hey ya'll. 

I'm okay. 

I'm trying to be okay with being okay. 

I've been trying lots of things lately, and I'm certainly seeing the results of my bravery. I've sobered up. I just got a job that I'm super motivated about, and I think after a few weeks I'll really be able to rock the shit out of it. All in all, I've learned a lot about self-care and self-love in the past month. In the grand scheme, I feel like I might finally be out of the rabbit hole, and can finally get my life moving again. 

But at the same time, I feel alone. I finally accept myself again, which is the most important step. But I feel like no one else wants to share the riches if found within myself. 
I'm a pretty cool guy, I make pretty cool music, and I'm pretty damn funny. 
But I have no one to sing for, and no one to make laugh. And as much as I appreciate my own company, it would be nice to have someone who values me as much as I do. 

That might come off as egotistical, but hey I'm a human being and yeah I have an ego. 

Sometimes I still need someone to take care of me, and I feel like I'm coming up short. 
I could really use a companion right about now. Some one to let me know that it truly is worth it to try to be the best version of myself. 
Someone more than my mom and my mirror. 

If you're alone tonight, I might be too. So let's maybe not be alone? ",5

"Hey everyone, I've been lurking for awhile now and since its 2017, I want to start fresh. 

2016 was my lowest point and I still feel so lonely and depressed. I've been seeking happiness in someone and it just seems like she is getting colder and colder. I just feel so lost and there seems to be nothing I can do. Some days I just feel so unloved after trying so hard to start a conversation with her. I should be happy since I have all I need but I just feel so depressed and horrible.

"Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram  (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out.  I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug? Thanks 

TLDR: Scared of the sexual side effects of Celexa, any positive experiences to ease my worry? ",3

"Hello r/depression, I have been staring at my phone trying to call the samaritans (UK helpline) for the last hour. But I can't work up the courage to actually speak to a person so I came here. I've been wanting to kill myself recently; and the multi-storey car park I could jump from is a 15 minute walk away. Recently the temptation to go there is getting strong. 
The only time in my life where I don't feel constantly pushed down on by a crushing weight is now, when I'm in bed. When I'm at work I feel like everyone is against me or wants me out. I bumble through my day only speaking when spoken to, and everyone looks at me very disdainfully. I feel like I am always being ridiculed and watched for any mistake. I feel like they gossip and bicker about me behind my back, and will jump on any opportunity to force me out.
I come home and I am responsible for my younger sister who is 18 and doesn't have much time for me. My mother lives with us but she not able to help due to suffering from mental illness. I make a dinner for my family and then have no choice but to be alone. I am so lonely I feel like I could cry.
I am 28, and the last time I had a girlfriend I was 19. I can't see how I can continue living being this miserable. Only the thought of my sister being upset stops me, but I'm beginning to think she wants me gone also. 
I don't sleep much anymore, and I feel very isolated from everything. My general thoughts have a kind of far away feeling to them. I can only deduce that I am severely depressed, so I am posting here.

"My girlfriend of 18 months broke up with me last March, I got over her within a couple depressing months. Then, I had bad acne, so I was put on accutane, and if anyone who sees this has taken it, they know how bad it is to take that shit, they even warn you that it can cause major depression, but I just wanted my acne gone. I was more depressed than ever, I hated my job, I was lonely, and I had nobody to talk to. There were multiple nights where I sat by my desk with my brothers 9mm, crying, wanting so badly to pull the trigger, but I knew it would affect all the lives around me. Somehow I made it through those 5 or so months of pure hell. Now the depression is somewhat gone, but I'm twice as lonely. I wake up every morning to the dreadful alarm being the only notification on my phone. I work 8 hours, all 8, I think of being home, but when I get home, I'm just as sad and lonely. It feels like I'm the only one on this planet and nobody hears me or my voice. I guess all I want is for somebody to appreciate me for who I am but I'm still looking for that someone.

"Hi, I'm 17, male, and I've been having depressed thoughts for about a year now (not sure if that qualifies as having depression). I have friends, but I'm constantly scared that they don't actually like me and when they do i assume they're lying (i have been lied to about that in the past and that makes it hard to trust them). Im not close with any of them after they all turned on me when someone spread rumors about me once (long story, we sorted it out but i don't feel right about them after they hated me so quickly without question). 

I'm constantly terrified of being too obsessive around the people i like and driving them away, and that I'm way too desperate for a friendship or relationship i can feel good about. I get extremely self loathing around them and this causes those who i am close with to get annoyed at me i think. Im scared of opening up to anyone about how bad my self hatred has gotten because theyll just think it's juvenile (not sure about that myself tbh) or whether it's just me fishing for sympathy. I try to be nice to people but i think i take it to an extreme and be too apologetic of anything i think may annoy someone slightly. I have no idea what to do with myself so i read or play games to turn my brain off so i don't have to think about anything. 

 I wish i could talk to someone about it all since it makes me feel better but i feel like they'll just be annoyed at me for wasting their time. I constantly have this feeling in my chest of worthlessness that i feel physically, it keeps me awake at night and wears me down. I never used to consider suicide until a few months back, but now these thoughts are getting more and more frequent until I'm thinking them every day. I just want to make this feeling go away and I'll do anything to make it happen. I'm sorry for posting this here but i don't know what to do, i feel so purposeless and i want it to end. I've never spoken about these feelings with anyone. I don't know if there's a specific subreddit for venting so I'm sorry if this isn't the right place.

"THIS IS A FOLLOW UP TO MY PREVIOUS POST

I always thought school was the real life version of hell,until I got my one month holidays,and started feeling dead,and super depressed,partly caused by loneliness,so at that point,I was desperate to get back to school,and I missed my classmates/cunts so much.

The day came,2/1/17,The start of school,I was just moved up to grade/primary six,and we now sit in pairs instead of groups,well,at least I thought...

out of the 39 students in my class,I was the unlucky one who got to sit alone,I mean,the teacher could just make one of the pairs into three people,but know,I was alone,at the back. What was so disgusting about this is that my teacher wanted me to be more social for a very long time,and yet she chose to let me sit alone and die inside,even when there are so many choices to get me together with other classmates/cunts.

Not only that,My co-form teacher asked me if I was fine,and I had to say yes,since I was the 'invisible' kid in the class and no one cared for me,and if I said no,I know for a fact that she would just call me a complain king,fucking fuck.

Now this part is the most painful to sit through,A girl that I liked and had her existence very much appreciated by me,was right in front of me,she had a partner,one that I thought was very childish and a trouble maker,I have to go through SEVEN miserable hours seeing them talk in the most amiable ways,while I just sit back in my area,having my soul to deteriorate by the seconds.

Well,at least she is happy,fuck I want to die.

Oh yeah,I also had to lie to my parents that I was doing fine for my first day,since I know they wouldn't do shit,Fuck yes,Back to school is fun,everybody!",5

"I'm currently going through some hard times and have no emotion towards it. I have ME (mialgic ensephilomitis), ME makes you become very tired very quickly to the extent that at times it even inhibits the ability to properly think. I have other issues but that's the main one. it first started in the middle of my freshman year, I'm now a junior. Because of it my doctors have removed me from any school and I'm to tired to do most things. This has made it as if I have been frozen in time while the rest of world continues forward without me. At first this was heartbreaking and I went through depression, however during that time I always thought that my emotions were not nearly as strong as a normal person's would be in this situation. Since then I have stoped being depressed but have also stopped feeling emotion towards my situation completely, both positive, negative and even neutral emotions, I just don't feel. I have also started finding it very difficult if not downright impossible to feel empathy towards others, or any other emotion for that matter and I have been left with only  logical reasoning -when I have the energy to properly think- to an extent. So I am wondering if my lack of emotion is normal or not? Is there anything I can do about it because it feels very unnatural.",2

"As far as I know depressive episodes usually last a couple months, but not for me. I sometimes randomly feel really depressed and sad for a few days, which seems too short to qualify as a full blown episode",5
"I know people say not being interested in previous hobbies is a textbook symptom of depression, but it kind of contradicts other things that I hear.

I'm 19 now and since around 15-16 I guess I slowly started to get more towards the state that I'm at now. I used to play a lot of video games (not to the point of completely neglecting everything else, I've always had great grades and some friends in real life) but I've slowly stopped playing them because none of them are the least bit rewarding or interesting to me.

I've tried to pick up other hobbies like reading and watching movies (they both just feel like chores that I am forcing myself to do), and I have ran cross country all throughout high school and now doing it in college through the club team at my school. It's hard to measure interest in running since it's not really something anyone does for the shear pleasure of doing it. I do feel good after a run for like an hour and I love the feeling of being impressed with my position in a 5k race and striving for a better time, but that's really it, it's not natural enjoyment I guess if that makes sense. It's all achievement driven.

I feel like I have tried so many things and I just haven't truly enjoyed an experience in the past few years. It sucks because it's killing my motivation to do well now in college because I'm starting to wonder what's the point of it all. Even socializing with people doesn't give me much joy. Probably because I'm super socially anxious and never feel like a connect personally with anyone that much other than with close friends that I've had since elementary school, which are like 3 people.

It annoys me because I hear of antidepressants making people feel numb, but it works for them because that's better than the pure sorrow and darkness that they feel in their everyday life. But my problem is actually that I feel numb, so how the hell am I supposed to treat that? 

Like I'm not even sad very often, I just am constantly bored and seeking something that actually would grip my attention. I sometimes just want to sit and stare at a wall for a few hours because it's as entertaining as anything else and requires the least amount of mental energy.

So I guess therapy could work for this? Thanks for any help. ",2

"  All my life, I've been told (I'm sixteen right now) that ""You're in kindergarten, it's going to get harder in elementary school,"" then ""If you think elementary school is bad, just wait for high school."" I'm in high school right now and it's the worst fucking time of my life. Being told that college is much harder and that I'm going to have a much rougher time is almost too much for me to just think about. I don't feel like I could go on any longer if life still only goes downhill from here.

  Just for some background, I've always been a high honor student (then honors, but that's fine since classes get harder). I've always put a lot of weight on how well I do in school, and my parents (well, my mother) would be noticeably disappointed or annoyed when I would get anything less than my absolute best. Because of pressure from myself and others combined with some kind of anxiety disorder, I've had at least twenty major anxiety attacks directly related to schoolwork and grades. And this was just in elementary school.

  Over the course of Junior High to High School, I've developed depression to add on to (and in some ways replace I guess?) the anxiety. I feel like I have no motivation to continue on doing my work, however the fear of getting bad grades still lingers, even though I can't force myself to do anything about it anymore. On my last mid-semester report card, I was failing two classes and getting Cs on the majority of the rest. I feel ambiguously about my grades now- it's tearing me apart that they're so low, yet I feel like I don't give a fuck about doing anything about it.

  And if it gets worse from here, I don't feel I want to be around much longer. But this feeling isn't new. I've completely prepared myself and stopped just barely short of attempting suicide three separate times, each time about three or so months apart from the last. A few hours ago, I stumbled across this subreddit, and I decided I'd try something new and share what's going on online.

  I was kinda afraid of sharing something so personal online to a lot of people I don't even know, but I feel that's for the better since I feel I can't actually reach for help to the people I see regularly. My father tends to get overly worked up about these things and I feel whenever I bring up the subject he panics, spends about a half an hour calming himself down, and then completely misses that I was reaching for help. My mother is the opposite, and (I think, though I may be wrong) views my having depression as a choice and a way to get out of work, as my grades have been steadily dropping, and I've been awake and active less and less. 

  And so I thank you, everyone who has gotten this far, you've been more help to me than most by simply listening to me about my situation.

So my question is, does it actually get any better from here?

"I feel like I'm not even a functioning human at this point. The amount of effort needed to simply get out of bed or do my homework unbearable. This is the first time where I have been able to see the physical effects of my depression just looking at myself in the mirror. And I'm at a point where my anxiety that comes with it is so bad that I would rather not do my homework and get yelled at than even think about it. I've never told anyone I'm depressed and I just kinda be the funny one at school or with my friends.

I've never gone to a doctor or psychologist or anything about my depression but I think I may be bipolar. I do (or did) go to a psychologist for ADHD and they said when I was like 10 I might be at risk for developing bipolar disorder. But that was that I'm 14 now and that's my theory.

I don't even know if I'm over reacting or something I just needed to vent. Thanks for listening to my rant.",5
"I know this sounds really superficial, but hear me out. I was doing ""okay"" for me - for a few days/hours anyway, and I saw a Chainsmokers music video, and just wanted to kill myself again. I don't know why I do this to myself",4
"It's like this: when I can't leave my bed, when I'm crying all the time, when I'm constantly late to work, when I haven't showered in weeks, I can tell myself: these are very clear, objective signs of depression. No wonder you're struggling with everything. Be kind to yourself.

When I'm able to hold a steady job without screwing up, when I can keep in touch with family pretty consistently, when I can clean my apartment: it makes all the things I still struggle with seem to be due to personal failings rather than disorder. So I hate myself.

I can't focus enough to watch a movie or read a book? Well, you can be on the internet for hours, so you're not trying hard enough to focus.

I've completely ghosted most of my friends? Well, you can still contact your family and two of your friends, so you're not really socially anxious; you're just an asshole.

I'm slow to speak and struggle to find words? Your brain is working better than when you were REALLY depressed, so you're a boring person with nothing interesting to say. By the way, you're a lot dumber now because the real depressive episodes ruined a bunch of brain matter.

I feel ""meh"" and numb all the time? You're not trying hard enough to experience new things. You get up to go to work; you should be able to easily get up and take a walk when you have the day off.

I don't know where I'm going with this.",2

"Holidays are over. Christmas presents are opened, food has been eaten, the old year is done and the new year has begun.

When I get back to work the inevitable question will come up: ""How was your holiday?""

I will answer ""It was alright."", or ""Just fine, nothing special."" or I will outright lie and say ""Was a fun time and got to spend some time with family.""


**What I really mean is:**


I spent my christmas alone. There were no presents, there was no family dinner. I spent christmas eve laying on the couch, sick with the flu and fever, eating microwaved pasta while watching christmas movies on Netflix, which honestly makes me even more depressed but I enjoy watching them nonetheless. 

On the day after christmas I spent the day gathering enough willpower and strength to go outside, not because I wanted to, but because my headache was killing me and I needed both painkillers and more food since my fridge was literally empty. Trip to the gas station for junkfood and painkillers was the 'highlight' of christmas for me.


On new years eve I was still a bit sick. I heard the first fireworks go off around 8 or 9pm. I kind of wanted to go outside and see them, but then I knew I would be standing alone like an outsider and watching the fireworks would be more likely to make me cry than smile. People may wonder why. Watching fireworks which is supposed to be happiness and bring in the hope of a new year. I see no joy or hope in the next year. Instead I see another year, another 365 nights of loneliness and darkness, another 12 months of coming up with excuses to avoid social gatherings and family events. Not that I get invited to those much anymore anyways. I went to bed at 10pm and slept until late in the morning. Happy new years to me.


**I will never tell my coworkers this, nor my family.**


Why would I? It just makes them sad too, and I don't want to make others depressed and talking about it just makes me sad and upset to the point where I end up in tears myself. I have no desire to be in tears in front of anyone or drag them into the dark pit where I'm stuck. Besides, what reason do I have to be sad or depressed? I have a nice job, stable economy and live well. If I was to really tell them how I feel I fear it would sound like whinging, complaining, being 'an entitled ass' or worse.


I know my friends probably think I don't like being with them since I almost always end up declining invitations, or just canceling in the last minute. I really do want to be with them, but when the moment comes it feels overwhelming, I feel out of place, I'm anxious and upset cause I don't want to bring down their joy. They invited me to christmas parties the previous years. This is the first year where I never heard anything from any of them...

I know my family probably thinks I'm upset with them or angry for something since I never show up for family dinners and events anymore. They didn't invite me this year either.

I know my coworkers probably think I'm just a misfit or arrogant since I decline every teambuilding and social gathering at work. That, and I generally eat my lunch alone by my desk rather than going to the cafeteria with everyone else. The few times I went I end up not talking anyways and just withdraw. I'm sure they think I am being rude or anti-social on purpose.


I love my friends, my family and I enjoy working with my coworkers.


But when they ask ""How was your holiday?"" how can I do anything but dodge the answer or lie?


So now it is 2018.

"I can't bring myself to enjoy anything social anymore. I can't be around my family because I'm sick of faking my happiness, I can't be with my friends because they don't realise the extent of my depression and I always bum them out by being too anxious to say anything. While I was planning my death a month ago, I got a message from my friend telling me she's getting a house with her boyfriend and I'm invited to her party, I was so shaken up that I didn't know how to respond and said ""cool I should be able to come"". I then deeply upset her for not congratulating her and she instantly started saying I was being a bad friend. She's aware that the girl I've liked for years is attending this party with her boyfriend (which is obviously extremely uncomfortable) but she told me to suck it up for one night so she can enjoy herself but... I just can't any longer, I'm sick of pretending I'm fine for the sake of others. So in the end me and this friend have fallen out ever since and I've decided I'm not going to this party for my own sake, I get the feeling that this will upset her but I just cant endure any more of this torment.

I've had 2 suicide attempts ever since this happened a month ago and I'm scared I might try again if she messages me telling me I'm a bad friend. I just can't deal with any of this any longer, I can't be what people want me to be any longer... And it's not me being a bad friend, it's me being depressed and wanting to live.",4

"Today, I barely ate anything at all. I had an appetite, I was hungry, but I just wasn't interested in eating. So I made the most low-effort thing I could get away with - a sandwich - ate that, and went back to bed, even though I was clearly still hungry. I just didn't care. Didn't want to put out the effort.

Now my stomach is sore, and it hurts so much, I can't sleep. I just felt absolutely bored with living today. 

This is the most sucky thing about depression. The thing that's hardest to talk to anyone about - the fact that *most of the time, I really have no will to live*. 

Today there was no reason for me not to end it. Not any that I could think of. I basically went through the day just thinking of all the people that would be upset if I did. And telling myself to hold off for a while, because they always seem so convinced that things will get better.

But it's kind of scary. Is this how it's going to end? I just become apathetic enough to end it all?",5
"I hope someone reads this. It's just a rant, but I need to say it, put it out there into the universe.  
  
I moved out of home at 18, and now I'm 20. I live with my sister in a different state, because I used to get on with her. But now she has turned into a different person since I was hospitalised for depression and suicide attempts last year - I think it's because I am a reminder of the terrible and abusive childhood the children of my family experienced, and my sister is in denial about it effecting her. She is cruel and angry towards me. My whole family think I'm overreacting/lying because that is  what fits in with their denial.  
  
I was so desperate for some understanding that I booked flights back to my moms house for two weeks over the holidays. I'm one week in and my PTSD and anxiety have been getting progressively out of control since arriving. My family don't respect my personal space, they touch me unexpectedly which is a major fear for me and when I tell them I'd rather they didn't do that, they just laugh and keep going. Every time someone touches me I feel an overwhelming nausea and desire to cry or act violently towards them. Even my 4 year old niece, who I love and does not mean anything by her touches. I know they're trying to protect themselves by acting like my problems are not real, but I can't handle it. We all went through the abuse, why am I the only one facing it (and therefore suffering from it)?  
 
  
I have 6 days until my flight back home, and 1 day after that is my psychiatrist appointment, which I'm hanging out for. I feel like my greatest need is to be accepted into a different family, just for a year until I can get over the worst of this. My psychiatrist and my psychologist are my only friends and it sounds sad but that's how it is. I don't trust anyone else not to hurt me somehow.  
   
I don't know what to do. I'm so alone, and so overwhelmed. I'm trying not to be hurt by my family because they're just protecting themselves from reminders of the past. they will have to face the trauma at some point too. But I feel like I need to cut them off from my life completely for a few years until I'm stronger.  
  
I'm just so scared all the time here, so filled with dread and fear and anxiety. I want to have a family that loves me and listens. My own family is toxic, full of monsters and damaged people. I'm still just a little kid inside, and I'm not capable of doing this on my own. The trauma work with my psychiatrist is slow going because I'm so damaged, and react intensely to the slightest reminders. The nightmares have been constant this past week and I can't afford to change my flight home to sometime sooner.

"We are all constantly searching for happiness in life and this is nothing more then the love emotion.

Why is it so important and powerful though?

The love emotion gives us so much in our lives that most are not aware of.

It is the ultimate emotion that gives us energy, motivation, happiness, intellect and clarity, health, makes us feel whole and contempt, increases our intuition that will give us the right questions to ask, give us the answers we need and ultimately push us towards our true personal purpose.

Did you realize it did all of this for us??

We constantly need to refill this love energy in ourselves without even knowing it. Most of us do it through the wrong ways that will have it fluctuating up and down causing an imbalance within ourselves.
We can do this from manipulating others of their energy, using substances, watching TV, using our cellphones, spending money, and the list goes on.

It does not have to be this way though and is not the best route. We can constantly have the love emotion in us and can do it in a beautiful way with ourselves without it fluctuating.

How can we hold the love emotion naturally?

We can receive and hold this beautiful emotion in us through the beauty of the natural world.
Through nature, the environment, animals, real food, ourselves, and even people if we do it the correct way. The energy is abundant and unlimited so it is not needed to manipulate others for it or do it in the non-beneficial ways.

Allow yourself to embrace the beauty of the natural world and have the love fill yourself completely.

Let go of your ego as it will just try to survive and destroy love.
Where love lives, ego cannot survive. It's only goal is to bring you down through selfish means and scare you into thinking love is not the answer.

Love is truly magical when you allow it to completely engulf yourself.

When you apply it correctly you can have all the benefits mentioned above. You will magnify in life and have an aura that will attract all the most beautiful things you ever wanted in you're life.",5

"So, I've come to conclusion that the worst part about depression is how easy it is to convince yourself things are fucking awful but it's so so hard to tell yourself things are good. 

Everytime something good happens I can see a way to ruin it. Because I always ruin everything. My new girlfriend? She's going to leave me because I'm not good enough and never will be good enough to love anyone as beautiful as her the way she deserves. Maybe it's kinder to let her go so she can find someone who really loves her and can properly show it. Not me. Not someone who sleeps all day forgets to text forgets to hang out can't even muster up the fuckin spine to tell her how I feel. 

No wonder she doesn't want to talk to me. No wonder she hates to spend time with me. I'm a stain. I'm nothing. To no one. Why bother? 

This is just some weird rambling. I don't know. I just want to isolate myself so I can stop hurting other people. And once I've succeeded at being completely alone then I won't feel so guilty about putting up a front and I cut and purge and end it all I want. Fuck me. ",5

"This world is so funny... it really is..

People swear they are there for you. They say ""I'm here for you if you ever need me!"" but then when you need them, they don't answer your calls, they don't answer your messages, they blatantly ignore you. It takes back all the sincerity of the gesture to be there for you..

I've thought about my own suicide more than once. Actually saying more than once is a bit of an understatement. I think of it every day. Many times a day. When I wake up in the morning, when I get into the shower (if I feel well enough to take one), when I walk outside, while I'm driving.. suicide is a constant thought in my life.

I know exactly how it would go too.. 

1. People would say they never saw it coming.
Oh, really? You never saw it coming? You didn't see my posts on facebook about how lonely I was? You never saw me asking if anyone wanted to hang out? You never saw my poetry that I posted about depression and my dark thoughts? You don't remember all the times I swallowed pills or tried to hang myself and had to be hospitalized? Is that all a blur to you?

2. People will post comments on my social media about how close we were, how much this hurts them... but truth is, they only do it for the likes. I can honestly tell you that I have 2 friends. I'm not kidding. 2. And anyone who says they miss me and love me or that they were there for me.. Its all a lie. People become so fake when someone commits suicide.
They take the death of someone and turn it into something that will give them social media fame, likes, comments. They're addicted to the attention and no regard to the life that has been taken by dark thoughts. 

3. No one will talk about the suicide part. Oh, it's just too sad. It's just too soon. They never want to acknowledge that suicide is REAL. 

4. They will forget me. After all the social media comments and all the posts saying ""RIP Angel"".. a few months will go by,maybe a year or two and then all of a sudden, I'm just a name. A name on a list of those that lost it. They finally reached the breaking point.

I'm writing this in case anyone tries to say that they loved me or that they were there for me.. because if they did, if they REALLY loved me, I would get a reply. I wouldn't be sitting on the bathroom floor crying my eyes out. They would answer their phone. I would have someone to talk to. But right now as I write this, I am alone. I don't matter to a soul now and I won't when I'm gone either. After a few years I will eventually be completely forgotten.

"I got out of the psych ward after a two week stay just a few days ago. They diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder, but I don't know how accurate the diagnosis could be given that I have the tendency to act accordingly to avoid certain diagnosis. My mother keeps trying to label me as a psychopath or sociopath, or a borderline. Mainly because I don't love her, I don't necessarily care about her or my brother. I think about them dying a lot, but I wouldn't kill them or anyone. I just know that I wouldn't particularly be upset if it happened, and that goes for most other members of my family.
I do have feelings for a few of my friends and partners, boyfriends or friends with benefits but I can't picture losing them like I can my parents. Maybe I'm too self absorbed but I really don't know.
My IQ is 108 so I don't think I could be a sociopath given that they usually are much smarter than the average person. A psychopath I don't know either but I really don't want to diagnose myself with anything, I'd hate to label myself as that kind of person.
I used to be a Christian. I was reading an old journal a few days ago, from eighth and ninth grade. I had written out a prayer, angrily question God as to why he allowed me to be born without the capacity to love my family.
I've never been suicidal, or tried to hurt myself past a certain extent. It seems like every emotion I do have is stronger to me than it would be the average person, I don't know why. It's hard for me to empathize with most people.
Based on experience or general knowledge from a third party, what are the possibilities that my mother is right about me? Is this regular teenage angst? I'm nearly seventeen.
This has been bothering me for a solid amount of time now, I thought maybe this could be the place I get a few answers, at least opinions.",3
"Just today.

Suddenly feeling utterly hopeless. I haven't fantasised about dying since the short time I did 3 years ago.

I feel no interest in doing anything else since Sunday... not schoolwork, continuing to look for a job, gaming, reading, watching movies or anything today. I have written a haiku but that is all I have done this morning. I like their syllable structure and it's easy to work with. I have started trying writing poetry a little bit just this weekend as oddly enough I am interested in that.

I have been fantasising about dying since yesterday. I guess because I feel like I already am dead. I can't tell anyone or more therapist because they'll probably lock me up in a hospital or something and that is neither pleasant for me, plus it would inconvenience everyone else.

Since playing this stupid horror game for a little bit today that a friend has recommended, the fantasies have gotten a bit more intense. I am not going to actually do it but it is weird to me that usually my depression manifests itself as only apathy with hopelessness. Now I feel pure despair and almost a self indulgent desire to pass away and not have to fight anymore.

I just really, really want to give up. I have a great family, great educational opportunities, decent health and a family that help me through so much of my stupid shit. I am a useless sack of shit that i can't take advantage of all the things I have going for me. I think literally everyone would be better off not having me around. I feel like such a burden to everyone yet they don't want me to relieve them of that burden (me) and me of my burden (having to keeo fighting myself) and it feels bad. I have not felt such a strong emotion as this despair in a long time now.

"Words cannot describe the emptiness I feel inside. The only emotions I can feel are guilt, self-hatred, anxiety, depression, and regret. I remember when taking a walk on a nice day would be pleasant. Now it's 4Â°F outside and the sun hurts my eyes. I remember when fresh snow used to look so mesmerizing and fragile. But now I look outside my window, see fresh snow and I think ""Fuck this white bullshit. I can't drive my barely working car in this.""  
Not that I would go and drive anywhere anyway. Nobody wants anything to do with me. People at my school see me as a freak, a social outcast. I wear all black most of the time with bandannas and necklaces. Y'know. The ""Dylan Klebold"" type of kid. Might as well carry a TEC-9.
 Nobody ever approaches me, and if they do it's just bullshit small talk or they are forced to talk to me because of some school group assignment. Also, to put it lightly...I'm not very photogenic. I'm 6'2'' 120lb male. Skin and bones. I'm blindingly pale and have a lazy eye, I can thank my dad's genes for that &gt;:[ And every girl I've ever tried to get has gone after the stereotypical football player hottie with big biceps. I've faced nothing but constant rejection. From everyone. From my friends, family, my teachers, and even myself. Hell, even my fucking *mailman* rejects me. My package has been sitting in your office for three days. I might as well walk the 3.4 miles down to the post office and get it my damn self. What the fuck man?

Anyways....I just wanna disappear to a far away tropical island for a few months with nobody but my crush and a fuck load of drugs. But that'll never happen. I've never been able to have what I want. I had a fucked up childhood, witnessed my mother throw a vacuum cleaner at my father when I was 6 years old scared and shaking in the corner. My half sisters always pestered the hell out of me, which I think is part of the reason I can't talk to girls well. 

I've felt depressed since I was about 14. But every year it slowly eats away at you, and here I am at 18 years old. A legal adult who is a hard drug addict, is essentially broke and works minimum wage, spends any/all income on useless bullshit like the newest adidas shoes or the newest video game, or drugs. Mostly drugs. Ive spent thousands on weed, benzos, blow, acid, shrooms, ecstasy, cigarettes, you name it. I've done it. All besides opiates, meth, crack, and that synthetic weed shit that makes people go ballistic. 
I started young too. Took my first hit of weed at 15, tried ecstasy and LSD at 16, coke at 17, and it all went from there. I haven't been sober in years. I've fried my brain. And I can't stop. I'm heavily addicted to benzos and drinking(more so benzos). It's the only thing that stops the nasty thoughts. The pills are the only thing that make my awful thoughts stop. Every day I think of a way I could potentially kill myself. But I've never acted on it. But I'm afraid I might have the balls to do it one of these days and end this constant suffering. My mind is pitch black. The lights are on, but nobody's home. I'm a ghost. I'm a shell of the person I used to be. 

Just wanted to get this off my chest. Any replies are greatly appreciated. But don't ask me to go and seek medical help, I'm already in the process. Sometimes I feel like it's making it worse, considering the USA's healthcare system is fucked. 

Anyway, thanks for the read.",4

i have been having a bad time with my depression as i feel like its ruining my life i am i a quiet person who doesn't like going out but my parents are always trying to get me outside which is fine but when i say no they always get annoyed with me and then start guilt tripping me and then it makes me feel terrible and doesn't help with my depression they know i'm sensitive but they do this to me all the time and i can't take it any more. i have no clue what to do when this happens it makes me feel terrible and all i want to do is curl up and cry but they just never understand i recently was harassed into going and yelled at my mum about how she did it to me but all i got was told off for yelling at her. they know i don't like going out yet they keep going on with it and if i refuse they punish me and to make matters worse my little brother copies me (he is only 12 i'm 16) then i don't know what to do anymore. should i talk to them or just avoid them when possible. i have been having problems with my parents for awhile as they always do something to affect my depression like putting me down every time i say im going to improve something about my life like i'm going to go out more then i get a response like this ""well you have to go out first to do that"" which makes me feel useless. i have been suicidal in the past and this consent nagging and putting me down has affected that.",5
"Why am I so unwanted by everyone? I've tried so hard last year but everyone just seems to hate me. It's a new year now but I'm still haunted by the memories that happened years ago. I'm so sick of living like this. Every time I try to improve things I find out that I'm far from making any progress. It's like being stuck in an avalanche and not knowing how to get out. I spent the first hour of the new year in bed crying and fantasizing about running a razor through my wrists. It might not kill me, but I feel like the release would feel so good. I didn't even expect to live this long. To have to be alone for another year and watch everyone I know become more successful than me in every way. ",4

"When something bad happens I can tell myself hey that sucks but it's just one thing, next thing will be better. Then something else bad happens. Then again. Then I break my nice electronic equipment. Then I feel like overdosing on all my meds. I don't want to live as myself. I can change some things about myself but in the end, the core of myself will always be here, and I hate what I see. My dad just wants me to ""get better"" and stop living off him, which is ok. But when I'm a broken, autistic shell of a human, it's nearly impossible to want to get up and do what I need to to live. I just want to get some heroin, a tent, and go live in a gutter till I eventually die. 

I cant live without getting high on *something*. I just want weed but noo my family doesn't understand so they won't help with that so I'm slowly dying from a mixture of cough pills and OTC pain meds. When I'm dead they'll just blame the drugs, not all the constant conflict inside and out of my mind.

I would just pretend to kill myself but it wouldn't do any good. My mom would say ""maybe we should try these herbal supplements..."" And my dad would say after a week ""alright time to get a job again, the world doesnt stop for one person"". So whats the fucking point, I'm just as trapped and hopeless as I've ever been.",2

"I've always been someone who has a small circle of very close friends and not much else and I'm fortunate that my current friends are wonderful people and very supportive of me, but I still feel very insecure in my relationships with them. Leaving high school has been very good for me, but I think to some extent I've sabotaged my own recovery and kept myself constantly sad out of fear that if I'm not in need of emotional support that my friends will leave me because I won't have anything to offer. Recognizing this has been good for me but I still am afraid that my friendships will naturally peter out because of my own deficiencies as a person. Does this make me a bad friend? I feel like I've been manipulative and an unnecessary burden and I don't know if that's a product of my own self-dislike or a reasonable reaction to my behavior.",4
"Hi there. Sorry this is a bit long. I'm looking for some advice or words of wisdom on how to cope with a severely depressed and suicidal best friend.

We've been best friends since high school. We went to different colleges, but she ended up transferring to my school (huge state school) this year. It's been hard on her -- she hasn't made many friends. I hung out with her often and always invited her out with my friends, but I think she feels uncomfortable joining and my friends find her to be annoying. She's been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as I've known her and has been consistently in therapy. She thought she was bipolar, but recently found out that she actually has borderline personality disorder and her parents/doctors have known for years. I think this makes her even more depressed.

This year she got really into xanax and was constantly barred out. I don't fuck with drugs for a lot of reasons and she is always pressuring me to try them, so I feel very uncomfortable around her when she's super messed up. One night she showed up at my dorm at 3am and passed out in the hallway after taking 7 bars and mixing it with alcohol. I took her to the emergency room and she stayed at the hospital for several days in the psychiatric ward. She doesn't get along with her family and refused to let her parents visit her or make any medical decisions. During this time, I was the only person she would contact so I brought her everything she needed, visited multiple times daily, helped her get excuses for all her classes, etc. 

After this incident she promised she was done with xanax. I know now that she continued to abuse it almost daily, but was more secretive about it. She went out and partied every weekend, acting like everything was fine. She got fired from her job (we work together) and failed all her exams. She found out that she's pregnant and doesn't know who the father is, and asked me to come with her to get an abortion. She told me she was going to take the next semester off and try to figure things out. She blamed me for encouraging her to transfer and not being there for her. In hindsight, I know I could have done more to help her adjust to the new school, but she repeatedly told me she didn't like my friends and wanted to make her own. 

She hooked up with my ex boyfriend when she was blacked out. I forgave her because I know she doesn't remember it and wouldn't have done it sober, but it still upsets me when I think about it.

Two days ago she tried to kill herself. She drank half a bottle of vodka and took 20+ different types of pills. She sent me a suicide note via text in which  she wanted me to send paragraphs she'd written to multiple different people. There was a note for me at the end-- she said that I ""was never there for her"" and that she feels sorry for me because I'm more ""fucked up"" than she is and I don't even realize it. 

I called her immediately, got her to send me her location, and then called 9-1-1 and her parents. When the ambulance got there, she was foaming at the mouth and they said she would have died within 20-30 minutes. Her mom has been keeping me updated the past two days. She woke up today and luckily doesn't have any brain damage. She's been asking to talk to me but doesn't have access to her phone and doctors won't let her speak or visit with any non-family members.

I just don't know what to do. The past six months have been hell for her, but also for me. She hasn't been there as a friend at all, which is completely understandable given the situation, but I've found myself becoming more distant from her. She tells me that I'm the best friend she's ever had, and then the next day says everyone else is telling her to not be my friend because I'm such a shitty person? I feel like I'm becoming depressed myself now. My therapist told me that the friendship is toxic. Everyone thinks I'm crazy for sticking by her. But all  her other friends have abandoned her. I see how much pain she's in, and I know she would do the same for me. At the same time I don't think I can keep this up much longer. I'm still her best friend, but she's no longer mine.

It makes me so sad to think about all of the good memories we have together. Would a true friend stand by her through this, even though she doesn't seem to want me to? I don't ever want to be in this situation again where her life is in my hands. Any advice/input would be greatly appreciated.",1
"Everything has just gone pear shaped. I had a great year on the whole, things really started to look up until they came crashing down. My mental state has been in decline for a few months and it's finally culminating in the destruction of everything good in my life. 2018 is shaping up to be utter dog shite.
I can't even tell the story, it is so complicated and spans over 3 years. It's all becoming too much and I really just want out. I don't even want to end it all, I just want to start again. I'm about to lose my girlfriend and that feels like the final straw. I walked out to the bridge last night, I really wanted to do it but on the way I talked myself out of it. It felt like as I walked there I left the reality that was torturing me and then as I approached my house on the way back, all the anxiety and fear and pain started to kick back in. I just got back in and cried for hours. My just-about-still girlfriend spoke to me and managed to level me. Today I'm back to square one where I think she's going to leave me, I can tell she wants and she should after that way I've treated her recently. I took my problems out on her and treated her terribly. I'm getting my just deserts. 
When she leaves me, I'll fail my exams, drop out and who knows. I don't know how I'm going to cope. My life was once so good.",4
"We are all meaningless and worthless. Our existence as a human species has destroyed the earth to an extent so far that there is no hope for repair. With everyone being greedy, selfish, and weak no one can stand for themselves. People can not be trusted with any information. There is always a way to extract that information. In the worlds history people have been tortured until they release precious information. Some information is serious and some not as important. This means that humans do not have the ability to safely store information. We are animals. We make choices free willingly. No one can be trusted because reality proves humans are sensitive weak fucks. Humans can be broken easily. Nothing but false confidence and pride allows us to live. There is no protection, no certainty or hope that cannot be broken. Im just a spectator. I could put down myself but that would be pointless. If im not feeling any satisfaction in this world then what is the point to keep living. I do not feel any attachment or love, or care. There is no satisfaction or any position energy or feelings that i feel as i wake up. Each day is a forced challenge. The world is not free. Out minds are psychologically abused and used by massive corporations. We do not have free thought. All our actions are watched and criticized. Media skews our perception of reality in the world. There is absolutely no freedom anywhere. Everyone who i look at is just following the schedule a forced schedule and routine that they are just programmed not to think any differently. Everything can change. There is no god. I don't want to put any energy into thinking about what is real and what is not. The only thing i seek is a satisfaction in life. Where something makes me feel comfortable and good or happy. This is not short term fake and false bullshit like drugs. Anyone with a working mind will realize those are bad for a number of reasons. But some people just go with what others say. Fuck that. Im not going to make people realize they are all programed and controlled robots. We are forced to do so many things. There is only one thing you can do if you realize everything is pointless and meaningless that is hope. You can hope for something but with out assurance that anything can disappear and be lost what is there to hope for. Your hope can be broken by everything around you. We are animals. Selfish greedy fucking animals. But we have our consciousness that separates us slightly from everything else in this world. But we are still animals. Which means physically we feel fear, sadness, pleasure, and lots of other feelings. It doesn't matter where we have come from we will all die. Why does it matter what we do if we will all die. Again what stops us from doing what we want can also be caused by religion. If we believe our actions affect us in another world then we will submit and obey. I don't know if there is a god but I don't care. If people understood that exact bit of words and realized that. Earth would be a complete shit show. But we have been dominated and controlled because most of us think we can not change some things about the world. Physically that is. We are fearful of physical pain and torment because those physical feelings stop us from being free. Because pain hurts. Humans are traped no one is free. This is why i want to be alone and talk to no one. Very few can understand and realize we are trapped. The way to controll humans is fear and pain but most importantly just not knowing the future and having uncertainty. No one is fearless or painless. Saying you have no feelings is a delusion of your mind. Every single living human has some sort of emotion that stops them from doing what they want. A simple example is our human physical feeling of embarrassment. Or shyness. I don't want to tel you what shyness is but embarrassing events are hard to understand why we become embarrassed. Some people become embarrassed by presenting in front of the class. Because our human bodys and minds feel embarrassment. Our body and mind are different although our body has an incrediblly strong indescribable connection to your mind. People are very dumb. Of course usain bolt is on steroids. They say the olyimpics are tested ok great. There are ways to cheat tests. At that high of a level of compitition anyone will do anything for a short term satisfaction. This satisfaction is either from the world or the persons mind. Sometimes both. Achievements in life are only in this life. They might make your mind feel good but its not eternal. Nothing is eternal. Everlasting. Everything can be broken. Safety is a false feeling. There is no real true safety. Unless i do not feel these warm feelings that I should. I don't know. Everything is cold, bitter, sad, depressing and i do not feel any satisfaction. Its depression or myself realizing that everything is a delusion and nothing is real. Im not crazy i just understand more than you. Unless my false sense of reality is also skewed to the point of no return. To where i feel no eternal warmth. There is no love that i feel. The only thing that separates my diluted mind is my physical body. I feel emotions like you. Pain, sad, happy, angry, depressed. These are what stops us from being free. The indescribable connection of our minds from our bodys. Our human bodys are what makes us want to live. Our human body is an animal. It controls our mind and our thoughts. We are all sick. Our body is irrational but our mind is rational. But our body will mess with our mind making humans the complex beings that we are. Again i feel no love or satisfaction. Everything i say and do is all from my body. Not my mind. My body controls my mind most of the time. I don't feel like i can control my body in a way where it will not affect my mind. Since we have a conciousness we are not gods. Since i have no satisfaction I don't want to live but my physical body affects my mind from ending it all. Maybe there is another realm, world, hell or heaven. Who knows. The uncertainty controlls us. We have freedom to sone dregree. Yes our free choices are the smallest most insignificant thing in this world. There is no attachment to anything. Why do i know all of this and feel that way i do. I do not know. I might be missing something. I am missing something its most likely comfort. Not physical comfort but the uncertainty in my mind. Uncertainty is why humans are fearing the future. Its cold dark and what is reality. What is a conciousness. There is no such thing as safety. Uncertainty and us as humans not knowing what the future holds alows religion to control us. Religion is based and controls you with out your thought because you are uncertain. No one knows the future thats what makes churches and religion wealthy and powerful. Because if you make someone hope for something good in the future then you can control them. Our unknowingness allows people to control us. Someone who we think is in authority can control us because of our uncertainty so they tell us what we want to hear. But this is a tool to control the masses. I know so much i have so much to share but my body stops me sometimes. Why do we follow what people say? Because the world has punishments for you. If you did not feel anything physically you would rule this fucking earth. Simple as that. People stop being so dumb. Many people are sheep they just follow. And it is not possible not to follow. Im loosing my thought process as my body physically drifts off to rest",5

"I feel like shit every single day. Nightmares at night, nightmares in real life. It's just an endless cycle. My family hates me. Nothing matters to them besides accomplishments at school or at work. I'm an embarrasment to them, nothing more. I still don't know why my parents wanted kids in the first place.

This world is so fucked up. Society only wants you to live so they can get money out of you. Everyone is selfish and only thinks about themselves. I try to avoid the news, but every time I catch a glimpse of it, I realise that we're fucking up more and more every day. How can you bring children into this world? How can you expect them to be happy?

I want to die. It's all I can think of. This suffering isn't ending, because I am never good enough and I never will be. My parents tell me to just suck it up and fight against it. To stand up for myself for once. To try to change. But I can't. I'm just weak. They're right, I'm never going to accomplish anything in life. I'm never even going to be able to get a job and keep it. I don't know why they're so against me killing myself, if they call me a burden every single day.

I have to keep living for my grandpa. The only person in this world who I believe is truly good and he loves me to pieces. I can't hurt him, I just can't. But you can bet that as soon as he's not alive anymore, I'll be out. I know it's going to be years and years of suffering ahead of me. I don't know how to push through. But I have to, for him.

Nothing excites me. I don't have hobbies. I either can't do them because of back problems, I'm bad at them and get yelled at by teachers because I don't learn new things or I don't like them. I can't concentrate on books. I hate sports. I can't even watch movies. I'm at a point where I'm just in bed all day, only coming out to eat because otherwise my parents would drag me downstairs.

I have no future. I have no dreams. I have nothing. Only the thought of death brings me some peace.

I don't know why I'm posting this. I don't expect anyone to help me. No one can help me. I tried therapy but my parents think that's for weak people and I'm not allowed to go a lot. I'm not allowed to see a doctor for meds. I'm not allowed to leave the house without their supervision. What are some random strangers on the internet going to do to change that? Sorry if you read through this, I guess I just wanted to write this out somewhere. Get it out of my system. Not bother my friends with it who don't give a shit anyways.

"I've stood on my family's apartment balcony numerous times, grasping the railing and imagining the rush of air and short impact of the ground, sometimes, in bed, I imagine how easy it would be to just grab a knife and push it in. Other times, I put a pillow over my head and cryâ I hate myself for doing that; most of the time, I don't even know why I'm feeling that way.  I am a senior in high school; I have a job, I practice six times a week, and have held a 3.8 GPA throughout.

I'm not feeling it though, I've put more effort into this rant than into any of my college essays, I don't care about my future, I've managed to achieve the lowest grades of my life in the first semester of senior year.
 I lied to my father the other day; he called me a ""fuckface"" and a""piece of shit."" He constantly reminds me of how lazy and spoiled I am, I never live up to his expectations. He always ends up shouting and swearing at me.
Water has always been a big part of my life, performing well in a recent meet brought me a feeling of elation I hadn't felt in a long time. I am lifeguard certified and teach kids how to swim. Being known as the ""fun"" teacher always brought a smile to my face. The sweet feeling of elation is gone now, I can't seem to care about the kids anymore. I've always wanted to pursue a career in the Coast Guardâ helping others, being in the water, becoming an engineerâ that was my dream life. I cannot motivate myself to write even one of the required essays.

"EDIT: I should clarify that I only draw keys. I'm not doing inbetweens. I can't animate for shit alone.

I'm a 20-something artist who just started an underpaid job at an animation company. It's only been 3 months and I already feel like a talentless hack. I don't even know how I managed to get this job. I don't even have a solid showreel and I don't have the time to build one. I honestly feel like shit about it. I cannot even enjoy making art at home anymore. I need help.

4 years of college was a waste. My college was shit, they didn't teach much for the amount of money my parents helped pay and sometimes I regret not quitting sooner but it's because of that place that I found the person I really like and look up to. They're a great animator and I wish to follow their path if I could. They don't know it but they're a great inspiration.

I've been crying for days and I can't focus on my work. I wish I could just quit but that's not a really good option for personal reasons.

I wish. Someone out there could teach me animation, 3D especially. I'm so desperate. I don't have the money to pay for online schools and I've had no luck finding good tutorials for everything I need to know to really get into this industry.

Right now I'm doing 2D animation but I want to move to 3D after this job. I know how to use the basics of Maya so that's not a problem. But I feel stuck. Paralyzed. I'm scared I can't make it alone. I don't even know if it's possible to transition just like that.

This post is going all over the place right now but I really needed to let it out and get help if I could. And no, I don't see a doctor to see if I have mental health problems or not. I don't talk to my parents about this either because they are conservative and religious (Not telling what religion) and let's just say I'm not ready to tell them I might have mental health issues.

"I spend most of my time with others pretending to be ok. Even around those closest to me, whom I've told honestly of the severity of my depression. 

If I don't, I feel worse. I feel bad for bringing everyone down, I feel bad for 'not trying hard enough' to have a good time. Like I'm intentionally doing harm to my loved ones just by acting how I feel.

So I act, I smile and laugh at their jokes or make lighthearted comments about whatever we are doing, but its an act. The entire time I'm exhausting what little energy I have just to seem normal enough they wont leave me.

But then... they actually think I'm fine. Even though I have told them it's acting. I've broken down on more occasions then i can count now. Begged for someone to help me. Begged for some support, or even just a friendly ear. And they're always nice while I'm crying, they listen to me blither for a while and promise to help.

The next day I'm faking it again cause the guilt of making them feel so bad yesterday is overwhelming. I think they'll remember, that they'll ask and actually care how I'm feeling. I think they may at the very least try to check in on me, or pick up some of the slack around the house. They might offer to drive me to my doctors, or really any gesture of support.

But weeks go by. They act like it never happened, like I never told them how I'm really feeling. So I break down again. Beg for help again. Explain it all again. They think I've actually been fine these past few weeks, even though I had blatantly told them I was acting.


Rinse.

"Hello, happy new year etc, etc. 
Not sure if anyone will read this but I'll write anyway.
I've been feeling so darn depressed for the past years and it has gotten so much worse lately. I only eat and sleep, like, all day.I have nightmares every time I try to sleep, and I wake up feeling like shit. I got so much to study and I've fallen behind.  I feel so empty and no matter how much I've tried to give my life some meaning, it all feels so pointless. I'm sick of waking up, I'm sick of breathing, I'm sick of being here. 
I haven't been diagnosed with any kind of mental illness, basically because I avoid talking to people about how I feel. (Can't afford a therapist either). However, I don't know if a diagnosis would matter. Because I kind of feel helpless and I really feel like it doesn't even fucking matter if some prof in a coat tell me ""oh hey something is wrong with your head"". (no shit man) This feels so overwhelming, and dealing with it seems impossible. 
I've talked to some of the people around me, but most of them are the kind of people that like memes about mental Illnesses, so their reactions were like ""Oh I'm depressed too haha"" , or ""You have nightmares? Welcome to the club"", ""you're suicidal? Cool me too!"".
Reactions by the same people who said they don't want to die because they have things they want to do.(Don't get me wrong, I love my friends)
As for my family, they call my childish and say I have no reason to be depressed.

Well 2 weeks In thoughts started occurring  to me, what if I get fired? What if I fail my classes? What if I loose my friends? Now I want to make it clear, I've had  depression and anxiety  for about 4 years and it hasn't gotten any easier hell it's the reason my last realtonship  ended in flames. Anyway so I tried not to succumb to the pressure  and bad thoughts that comes with anxiety  and depression so I started to try as hard as I could and even still I started to fail my classes so I thought well fuck how am I supposed to deal with this and the same day someone I thought I could count on decided she didn't want to be friends anymore so instead of coming and talking  to me like an adult she decided to call the cops and wrongfully  accuse  me  of stalking and tried to have me arrested long story short I ended up having to spend a night in holding. So I lost a friend and to make a long story short my whole world is crumbling right in front of me, I left school, I don't have a job and I think one of my best friends I think doesn't want to be friends  anymore and you know what I don't blame her, and just for now we will call her, M and truth be told I've kinda developed feelings for,  M as much as I like to deny that it's the truth, this might not even be in the same category but I'm also an extremely violent person I got it under control in the past few years but that doesn't stop the thoughts hurting someone else as a kid once I stabbed  another kid in the arm with scissors, even my other friends, I'll name them A, and J,  I think of hurting, I honestly  don't know what to do. I almost killed myself I had the knife pressed up against  my stomach and if the RA didn't come in I probably  would have done  it, and honestly  I'm thinking about doing it again. Hell I don't tell my friends this A, and J I see them as brothers but when I talk to them I put on this brave face but it's just an act when underneath I'm weak and in serous pain.",2
"For me, listening to songs - whether they're happy or sad - and watching TV. And, of course, a good cry.",5
"I was doing better for a few weeks. Went on vacation for the holidays and it was supposed to be great. I never got that down time I so desperately needed. Now I go back to work tomorrow. I feel physical pain from the inside out. I want to scream and cry and tear my body apart. I hold my wife back. She makes more money , spends less, and is more adventurous. She would have moved to another state or country by now if not for me. All I do is waste money and time. I am bad at my job but we are short staffed so they won't fire me until things settle down. And I hate what I'm doing. But I got my masters and I have student loans to pay off. That is what is keeping me from commotion suicide. My wife would be stuck with the loan payments. But my God I want to die. Please kill me!!!",2
"I fell for my best girl friend/ best friend and she is the only happiness I feel. Whenever I am doing something with her, texting, sitting next to her, thinking about her I feel genuinely happy. Games have basically ceased to exist in my happiness radar. However, she is also one of the reasons I am depressed. I heard her tell me ""I love you"" and I love her too, but my depression prioritizes everything in my mind, even my feelings for her so half the time she is the only hope I have and the other half she becomes this endless pit and I fall deeper and deeper. My life has been put into shambles because of this stupid mind game my brain put on itself.",4
"failed my exams last year, retaking the year. got mocks coming up that are really important, and if i dont do well i can get kicked off again. 

dont have the strength to keep going after being held back twice.


on top of that i was a dick to my girlfriend and now she full on hates me, obviously deserved (not trying to blame her) but it's still shit. have no friends, nobody to talk to, and dont know how to get it out.

been close to calling a hotline but can never quite bring myself, never feel deserving of one",2
"Hey guys, I'm doing well. I take 60mg prozac and it works like a charm. Depression is part of who I am though and I don't want to forget that. When I drink, I can release those inner thoughts. Obviously this is unhealthy, but it just feels so good to cry. Usually it's my dad that I always think about. When he was at hospice, my mom took a picture of us playing our last chess game. http://i.imgur.com/SLBYwJC.jpg?1 I thought the picture was genuinely a powerful picture. I posted it on reddit and will never forget what it feels like to see a stranger wishing me well. 

I deleted the post cause I was a fucking liar. I talked as if I was staying strong for him. I was in a psychiatric  facility twice when he was dying. I couldn't handle it. I wasn't even close to him but God did it fucking hurt knowing he was leaving me. 

I remember him struggling to walk. He came in my room and told me to get my shit together. I didn't want to hear a walking corpse telling me how to live my life. I told him, ""I can't wait until you fucking die."" What i said to him haunts me every fucking day. He called the cops on me and I was admitted.

I start my paramedic class today. I don't want to stop there. I want to be a doctor like my dad. He's literally everything I aspire to be. I wish I could let him know how much I look up to him now. Sadly, it's what I said to him when I was admitted that I remember. 

I just really wanted to vent. I know we all got to the point we're at in a different way, But we're all fighting the same condition. There's a reason you guys are still here. You want to fight this shitty fight. It's not cause you're to scared to die. You think fear would prevent you from escaping? Fuck no! I love all you guys who fight this hellish condition. Keep it up! I believe in all of you! Thanks for reading. Sorry if this looks like shit, alcohol.",4
"Sorry, this is my first reddit post ever because I'm really good at lurking but not at contributing to anything. I'm starting my second semester of college at IUS soon, and I'm really excited because it's my only way I get to go out and do things besides staying home and slowing drifting towards wanting to die. 

Every day I hope I make a new friend but I realize I'm wrong and I go home feeling like shit because I feel like everyone thinks I'm as shitty I as I feel I am. I asked this guy I liked out after I embarrassed myself the day before and I fucked everything up; I lost all chance of dating I had with him. Everyday is just another day for me to feel lonely. On the last day of drawing class we had I started violently crying before class at my easel because I'm a weak piece of shit. I got a 3.5 gpa on my first semester back though and that makes me feel really happy.

I can't even think of what to say when I try to talk to people; I always draw blanks in my mind and I end up just awkwardly being there with nothing to say and nothing to contribute. I'm only able to be friends with people who are able to put up with my shit and are able to put effort into being with me because I'm barely putting enough effort into being alive.

I still have hope though that good things will happen to me and make me feel like I'm an actual person and not a corpses that just goes day to day doing nothing. 

I'm also going to this sleepover thing for the new years and I hope I'm able to make friends. This will be my first new years I celebrate at somewhere other than my home.",1
"Some background information:

My lowest points were 2014 and 2015. I was 15 and my family moved to another country, but it wasn't what I expected which led me to stay isolated in my apartment for three years. I was too paranoid the people I met at school would see me active on social media and ask me why I haven't been in school. Which also meant I didn't contact my friends back home for a while.

When I visited home it was during the summer and we could only afford to stay two weeks. I tried to do as much as I could in those two weeks which made everything feel rushed.

In 2016, my last year before moving back home, I was in a long distance relationship, it was going great in the beginning but towards the end I could tell something was different and it led me to become obsessive with his activity on social media. We broke up before I moved back home but I found out my friend, who introduced me to my ex, and him liked each other. It did hurt since he was my first boyfriend and I felt worthless and I didn't deserve love because this was the outcome. I also knew they hung out but she was my best friend and I trusted both of them 100%. I have never felt betrayal like that. I wanted support from my friend group but they weren't there for me so I lost them as well. 

I am friends with another girl who is separate from that friend group and she was all I had when I moved back. When I was living away I felt so homesick but now that I was back I didn't feel welcomed. This all happened in May of 2017. 
Making friends has been difficult, I notice I've been having trust issues and I don't let people get close easily. But I also crave a connection with people. I also feel left out when I see people I know doing stuff without me. Sometimes I get obsessive of other people's activity on social media and all it does is make me feel worse and I want to stop. I never felt this way before moving so I feel like these are bad habits and patterns I developed while being away.

**Here are my main concerns/tl;dr: I notice myself spacing out a lot and focusing on the past rather than the present, sometimes I check where people are or what they're doing via social media but it becomes obsessive, I don't like that I get concerned about other people and care too much about what they think, and I feel like I focus on the negative too much.**

I feel lost but I know I want to be in a better place. The solutions might be simple but my emotions are clouding my judgment. I know this was long but I appreciate any help or advice. Thank you in advance.

"   Hi reddit, I would like to tell you a little bit about myself, and hopefully meet a great community to help me on my journey. I a'm a very quiet person, don't get much attention, and I spend all my time at home or at school.I'm 17 years old and tonight is my last day of Christmas break, and my last day of childhood since tomorrow is my 18th birthday (technically today since my birthday January 4th and it's already 1:50AM).I have spent my night drinking, smoking, and crying. The only thing I've been able to think about tonight is how dull and boring my 18 years have been leading up to this point. I haven't accomplished very much at all in 18 years and everyday i feel worse about it. Well I've made a firm decision to change my life tonight.
Tomorrow morning is my first day back at school, and my first day as an adult,after two long and lonely weeks of Christmas break. I've been ignoring my depression for a long time now, and I'm just now starting to acknowledge the reality of it. I'm already trying to get myself on the right path and basically this post is some sort of icebreaker to try and get involved in the community and to get some tips on staying positive, and some positive and insightful perspective on my life. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this. I will be replying to comments tomorrow after school, good night to everyone and I hope you all have as great of a day as I will tomorrow.

"Hey friends,

I just want to tell you all that you are great and I hope you all have a great 2018. 2016 and 2017 have been rough for me, but I am finally making progress and I want to tell you that no matter how difficult things are, they will look up! If you would like a friend or someone to talk to, you are free to message me or comment.

Anyways, have a great New Years and keep on plugging along! ",0
"It's been horrible these last few years trying to make something out of myself. I still don't trust my own opinions, my parents have full control of my life, and I'm refused medical help.

My family just thinks its something I can just not think about and it will go away. I find it impossible to tell my family in words how I truly feel everyday. It seems like they just see it as laziness, even though there's nothing I wouldn't do to feel 'normal' one day. Spending all my days on the break of crying, truly is miserable regardless if everyone thinks it's made up or an excuse for not being proactive(I've heard it all). Not really sure what I'm asking for in this post. It's just been a really hard this week, month, years.",3
"The pretty ones are usually unhappy. They expect everyone to be enamored of their beauty.

"I feel like im at the end of my rope. As the new year starts i am 13 mins alone by myself. I have no close friends around. I have no inclination to go out and ""meet people"" I just want to go home after work or on my days off/weekends and do nothing then feel like crap for not meeting people which starts the cycle of self loathing over and over again. Sometimes I think of hurting myself, or killing myself. the one thing that stops me is knowing that it would only hurt my family, and my clients. I work a lot and love my jobs (work with special needs individuals) and i will not do that to them. if did not have my jobs and my clients who love me i would do something but i do n0t. 

I just dont know how long i can go, will i make it out of 2017?",5
"I've had clinical depression for 9 years now. I'm 24, no family and very few friends (none close). I get ups and downs and today is a very down day. I'm just tired of living, tired of feeling so down, so hopeless, so unhappy. It's days like this when I just want a hug from someone, anyone.

Well point being I can't continue with this wretched disease posing my thoughts, relationships and life.
Seriously at a loss. I've tried extensive meditation, SSRIs and a host of other meds, drugs, quit alcohol completely for almost two years, regular exercise, first etc.

"Hi all,

A friend of mine has gone down a depression spiral over the past year and 1/2. She has seen psychologists and psychiatrists and the only thing they seem to help with is medication. 

She has refused to take the medication properly. She started but stopped after feeling terrible. 

She will make plans and then cancel them because of her panic attacks. They happen daily at specific times, she has one at 7am daily. They will also occur intermittently throughout the day and which point she will be unable to do anything but runaway and be alone, presumably. 

She cannot work, remember things consistently, or think.

She has attempted to jump out of a moving vehicle.

Friends and family have all come to her aid but she essentially refuses any kind of answer because they do not solve her issues. I'm not sure there is a correct answer. 

The biggest source of sadness for her is her age, coupled with where she is in life. She has spent the past 4 years in a masters program for biology that most likely will not amount to a job. She feels as if she wasted her time and will have nothing to show for it. 

I have suggested changing fields but she doesn't have the financial resources to do so comfortably. She is also engaged and doesnt not feel comfortable relying on her fiance for money.

She doesn't make a lot of money, so paying for therapy isn't an option, really. 

I'm just a friend, but I feel helpless that I cannot help her. She has attempted to hurt herself, so I want to do whatever I can or at least be helpful in some way.  


Any suggestions would be helpful.",3
"I never dreamt it could have lasted this long. It feels like every moment the feelings abate are really only a brief reprieve, the returning torment tears into my psyche with even less remourse. The corruption grows ever inside me, sometimes sleeping only to awake at times it needs to destroy.

The point of trauma feels so far away in time, nearly four years. When the episodes occur, it only feels as it happened just seconds prior. I have no physical ailments, only desolation of the mind. I haven't found an environment for healing, and I don't think I ever will. Isolation is sporadically maddening, not knowing if I'm truly losing my sanity or just feeling the pangs of past wrongdoings. Social circumstances are not helpful to the source of pain, when the episodes occur, all others can sense the turmoil and recoil at the possibility of backlash from this force.

It is a malevolent manifestation of my reality. All manner of action: speech, observation, hearing, all the surroundings are contorted to keep me bound to its dark will. None can even attempt to wrest control of the power it wields, its strength is insurmountable. I'm but a prisoner to its will, the slightest misstep in my path through life it sees an opportunity to grow and infest more within the spirit.

I feel as undeserving to face a plight so dire. It only exists when it feels the possibility to arise. I feel as though an instrument or vessel of its ill conceit. I look into a mirror to see a fair face staring back, crystal blue eyes, a symmetryÂ  throughout; many smiles from others abound me in my days, and I feel yet obligated to receive this blessing. My looks yet deceive my emotion, for I know a disgusted figure is writhing within. I cannot tell what yet be unattractive to most: a physical flaw or a scarring of the soul that only seeks to rend into another. I won't let my fellow man that deserve peace be upended in their stable life by a force so reckless.

So I reserve myself, keeping this force of trauma at bay from others, while enduring the suffering of its imprisonment. If love could break its chains that bind itself to me and I to it; it has not yet been gifted from those that radiate beauty throughout, or even a divine power to ease my pain. Society has disillusioned me of the agony I face. I am aware of flaws of the human nature that are best left ignored. Faced against this foe forces my consciousness to the dark reality.

I only wish I had an answer or remedy to this trouble, I fear that none may be found.",1

"I'm going to die. Okay, I'm being dramatic, but it really feels just like that. I've already been suicidal after losing a friend recently, and it just hasn't been getting any better. I didn't sleep a wink last night even though I was so tired I couldn't keep my eyes open on the commute. And now I cannot DO ANY FUCKING WORK RIGHT NOW.

I've been trying, with this half-written (more like quarter-written) essay open in front of me, to finish this stupid piece of crap once and for all. My professors are very understanding, they just told me that I can hand in a craptastic essay and they'll understand, as long as I hand in SOMETHING. And that SOMETHING is not something I can even manage to do right now. I start veering off onto other sites even if it starts causing me severe anxiety. I absolutely can't focus, and not because I have other thoughts in my head!! Why is this?? I've heard about executive dysfunction and I sincerely don't know if I have it, what's been causing it, or if I'm just a lazy ass who doesn't want to do work. It's not even work that I hate!

I feel like deep down, I do have the power to get out and get things done...but I'm choosing not to. I'm choosing to stay in bed and play this stupid fucking game.

"So in the past year i think i made a lot of progress forward, i got my own place, took control of everything in my life, found a new group of friends (i don't know how, i just did), reconnected with some old ones.

And finally i honestly felt like i built some proper confidence in my self (all the while keeping that dark side at bay).

New years rolls around, i spent most of NYE talking to a girl half of which was sober (a year ago, that was literally impossible), I've met her before through old friends, and honest to god i thought the my feelings toward her were basically love at first sight type deal, more i talk too her the more i like her....anyway so, whole night and i'm thinking maybe, just maybe i could start something with this girl (note, never had a girlfriend so this feeling is completely new and obviously terrible at signals, i interpreted everything as interest in me on her part.....).

Get to end of the night (at which point shes keen to grab couple more drinks elsewhere) and bang.......she rings her boyfriend.

Then changed her tone to ""i should probably head home"" and bailed (no doubt there were other hints and signals i just didn't get or pickup on, cause i suck at that, so i guess most of this is my own fault), and now, after walking the dark streets for a better part of an hour, im home, alone and feeling just utterly terrible, hating my self for being so blind too it all and worst part, i thought i really had found someone amazing on my birthday of all days......

Life is cruel, even when you think you're doing well and getting out of that dark hole, theres always something that'll drag you back down :\ ",5
"23F here. I have depression that comes in waves, and then recedes after maybe 6-9 months, with no warning and for no apparent reason. This has been going on since I was 18.

During these lows, I get suicidally depressed. I see the world through an incredibly negative filter until nothing seems to matter much at all. I often doubt that reality is even real sometimes, I feel so detached.

Since nothing matters and I kinda plan on maybe killing myself soon anyway, I tend to lose my inhibitions. I tend to feel so much pain that I can't expend energy pretending to be happy or living up to society's expectations. Nothing matters, and Devin's a prick, so I'm going to tell Devin he's a prick, consequences be damned! 

My depression is receding again and I am cringing at the things I did when life seemed to have no purpose. I am now having to pick up the pieces of what I destroyed in my depressive period- I'm a straight A student outside of these lows, but fail most classes during them. Next semester I plan to graduate with my Bachelor's, but I'm going to have to work hard to make up for lost time to even get above a 2.0.

Over the last few months I have cried in public, at work...I have snapped at people- depression tends to make me extremely mean. I always suspect people hate me and have bad intentions...my own grandmother, an angel on Earth, took me shopping, and I was totally pissy the entire time. This is partially because depression makes me feel physically horrible, exhausted and headache ridden constantly, but I still feel like an awful person.

While not depressed, I drink like a sane person. While depressed, I give up on moderation completely and drink as much as I want whenever I want. Tuesday at noon? Let's get blackout drunk! There is no God anyway!

Yeah, I showed up at Thanksgiving very visibly hammered, to dinner with my extended, religious family that doesn't drink. Before my depression started to melt, I just shrugged at how horrifyingly taboo this is. WHO CARES IF THEY'RE JUDGING ME? I'M BEYOND HOPE ANYWAY!!! HATE ME LIKE YOU ALREADY DO!!!

Yeah, my lows are VERY low.

Now I'm back to the outgoing, relatively high achieving, sane human being that I am half of the time and it's like waking up the morning after drinking realizing how horrible and embarrassing all of your actions the night before were.

Am I the only one who has experienced this?",3
"It's been one hell of a time these past 5ish months and lately, my depression has been kicking my butt.
  
I finally took my two sons out again. After way too long of nothing but Christmas events, a NYE BBQ and birthday dinner.
  
I took us to one of my favourite places to go. There's few people (especially when it's not school holidays), there's loads of wildlife around and plenty of seats so you can rest frequently (important when you have small kids).
  
And it feels good. I'm exhausted. Sore feet and legs, a bit dehydrated and sunburnt, but still better. I also have a few photos to show for it, which is always good.",4
"Recently I got together with my long time on and off close guy friend from high school. We hadn't talked in over half a year because I blocked him due to the fact that I felt he was constantly leading me on. A couple of months ago he found a way to reach out to me and I ended up calling him and we met up. I ended up kissing him, which is not my nature because I would like to wait till marriage to do anything sexual. Kissing is not too much of a big deal for me but it is something special. I began talking to him again and we would hang out and kiss. I had an emotional breakdown in front of him at one point and that is when I realized that I really liked him. I decided it was time for us to have a talk about where our relationship was going because I had many boundaries and he had many expectations that crossed those boundaries. I finally had a talk with him where he didn't take me very seriously and constantly made jokes about sex and how that's what he wanted from me, till I realized he wasn't merely joking, the things he said had a lot of truth to them. I felt very stupid for being so oblivious to the fact that this man that I have known since high school was such a dirt bag. I ended up leaving his car mid conversation because he wasn't taking me seriously and we haven't really talked since. The following day I felt so liberated. I never felt so happy in my entire life. I realized that I deserved much better but the issue is, I never seem to give that to myself. Despite feeling pretty great about my crappy fling ending, I feel like a part of me is upset. I always end up grieving over people who didn't really try with me and for some reason I don't care this time. For some reason, I want him to see what he missed out on. I know he and I are on different wavelengths, I understand that. I just feel like he lost someone who could've given him real love and care, someone who would've fed his mind. He and I clicked, we had nothing in common but we clicked. He has never been involved with a girl like me, someone willing to feed his soul instead of his body. Sometimes he would make fun of me, call me a ""12 year old girl"" because my idea of a relationship doesn't include sex. I feel like nobody will date me because of this matter, though I know I'm beautiful and hold many admirable characteristics. I feel like this is all buzzing in my head and bringing me down. The fact that I am so underappreciated at times. I do it to myself. I wish I could stop.
Thanks for reading this.",4
"Is this a normal symptom of depression? I am really, really bored with life. It scares the fucking shit out of me. Like I'm scared I would do something to myself, even though i know I wouldn't. I have things I could do, shopping, exercise, reading, watching TV. They just all sound pointless. And life feels incredibly boring and that is scaring the shit out of me. It's New Years and all I can think about is life being boring.

"Kinda lengthy post, but I'm just really lost right now so my apologies in advance... 

So today, my best and only friend, he finally gave up on me. I've tried my very best to hide my depression from him, even going as far as constantly putting a mask on and suppressing my true emotions in an attempt to appease him and not become burdensome. But as many of you well know, that tends to become rather exhausting real quick... and sometimes our depressive nature shows. And today mine showed. He wanted to hangout and watch something, and I wasn't feeling up to it at all, so I politely let him know. He then went on to say in response ""You're always in such a gloomy mood... stop trying to make people feel bad for you cause it's not gonna happen."" He then told me that I need to grow up and that he doesn't want to talk to me for a while until I grow up... 

I'm not sure what to do now, like how I should go about this. I guess I just need some advice and/or guidance fellas. Anything will be immensely appreciated. Thank you for at least taking the time to read.",4
"Hello everyone

as the title says I typed this for a friend, it explains in the text why. I have a history of depression and self harm (not suicidal, just really numb when depressed) which my friend doesn't know much about, but he knows me well so he will relate instantly. 
Trickier thing is that he is really far away (he moved to GB, I am in Germany. He is going through a rough patch himself, just before christmas he got rejected by the first woman he approached after his wife died early 2014. He is mentally stable though and I am sure he'd want to know this, I am just not sure how to tell him really. I can't word this in free speech, I am not a native speaker and I want this to be as clear as can be. I do fear the text might be too much and/or weird? I have no proper judgement anymore...

here the text, I'd appreciate any help. thank you

So, first of all, I don't expect anything from you, I just need to share with someone who I knows me well enough to understand and I need you, as a friend, to know about this in case it will get worse (no worries, this might sound overly dramatic, it's not that big of a deal for me since I am used to it) 
A few months back I started feeling stressed and burned out without being able to put a finger on why that is since realistically I had less to do than like a year back. I explained it to myself with lack of interaction with others or dull tasks which have to be done over and over or just hormonal crap and took that for the reason why I felt mentally unstable.
I tried to work on it, made sure to get some breaks here and there, was drawing and painting and meeting with people but things didn't get better (which I only realized a few days back)
The first time I was alarmed was when the urge to just run away for a day or two. There I realized for the first time that my mind is not sending the right signals, since I love the boys and xxx and being away wouldn't be nice at all since I'd miss the kids for sure.
Still thinking it was an overload of work I talked to xxx, telling him all this and asking him for help (like helping out around the house, that kind of help) which he tries to to his best efforts. 
It's still not getting better. I had a proper meltdown on my birthday and on second day of christmas, still not releasing fully what's going on. This night I couldn't sleep, I went to bed at 11:30, fell asleep close to 1 am and woke up around 2:15 (thank you fitness tracker for the accurate information) The baby woke me and I couldn't fall back asleep although I tried everything that would usually help. So I laid there thinking it all through and then all kinds of bad memories popped up. You know that I have the worst memory and that I am amazing with âforgettingâ things I don't want to remember, though they aren't gone for good... 
Not sure why the normal version of me always decides not to find a way to truly process all the stuff so this shitty version of me wouldn't have so much to feed on but that's how it is now. I also realized that I have a general numbness when it comes to feeling emotions, I'm never very happy or enjoy things to the fullest, nor am I really sad nor angry or anything, everything is a little muted. That I actually hate and fear the most, becoming numb and empty.
So, this leaves me where I am now. It's not unbearable or anything, but I am afraid where'll lead to eventually. I want to be a good mum and a full functioning person... 

I think I needed you to know, as I said, in case things go a lot south and I'd need your support.

"My sister's art has helped both her and me in our struggles with depression and anxiety (I was with clynical depression for about 5 years with the lowest of lows most of you here know). 
Here is what I'm referring to, let me know if you find yourself somewhere: http://www.boredpanda.com/my-little-sister-expresses-her-troubles-and-emotions-through-her-breathtaking-art/",0
"Yeah. I'm a fucking bitch and there are people who love me. I don't know what it feels like to not have anyone, and I'm a fucking bitch for wishing that were the case. Do you know what it feels like to have people ""love"" you so much, because they have to, because they're biologically bound and culturally responsible for you, even though you'd both definitely not chose to be in each other's lives... for each and every family member? Do you know what it's like straddling two cultures from opposite sides of the world but being born &amp; raised in another they vehemently love but also resent because of the ""way you turned out""? Do you know what kind of things they say to try to snap you out of it and make you realize what a fucking cushy life you have with too much time on your hands and a nagging desire to want to make other people think you are worse and crazier than you are because you are dramatic and attention seeking, and not even knowing how much of that is actually true or not?

""What about friends and other loved ones?"" I have three people who have been strung along since high school/college who miss who I used to be or could have been but admittedly don't know who to expect or wouldn't really make an effort to except for they probably think that I'm going to kill myself. My ex still thinks he loves me but he's a crazy heroin addict who thinks the sex is great and probably thinks no one would take him and also that I'm at least potentially/relatively stable, if not just financially. Everyone else I meet is just online and eventually leaves. Fear of abandonment, that bullshit. My cat was my world and means nothing now.

So why the fuck would I care about the loved ones I leave behind. I stopped loving them a long time ago and the entire world couldn't love me enough to make up for me not loving myself at all.

Secretly I do want that. I want someone to love and take care of me. I want someone to love and take care of back. I want all of it and I want it exclusively and I want it all of the time and forever and now. But realistically, it's never going to happen. Not with my mentality or impatience or grandiose ideas or not working on (loving) myself or anything. I'm tired and temperamental and lazy and I give up. And I don't give a FUCK",4
1 month ago I was considering suicide.  I talked to my primary care physician and told them how I was feeling and what I was thinking.  They put me into a group therapy program and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder.  I can honestly say it saved my life.

"Graduated from high school in '13 and everything went downhill. 
Lost a significant other of 2 years to a ""best friend"" who enjoyed sex with her, as well as a few other ""friends"" of hers. I was in ""love"" I guess but that spiraled into excessive drinking, partying, drugs, suicide attempts, and problems at home. 

I can't believe I'm still here today, but I lost a lot as things went down the pit. I had some true friends who I ended up abusing their kindness, and there's no chance of them coming back. On top of that, I made a fool of myself to my entire demographic in my hometown. It's a surprise I'm still here today, but at the same time I cannot help but to think of how much less pain I would be in if one of those attempts were successful. 

I'm not considering doing it right now, but I wonder when I'll burn the last of my rope. At this point there's nobody who can help me other than myself, but it's going to be a long and lonely road. 

Here's one for those who tried, and an apology to those who simply had enough.

"As I was trying to fall asleep, I started to hear weird things coming from outside my bedroom. I heard creaking noises, noises that resembled the washing machine, and noises that vaguely reminded me of what it sounds like when my mom has her TV on. My mom wasn't home at the time for any of this, though. I had my bathroom's fan turned on to help me sleep(I usually do that), and I kinda heard all the extra noises through the fan noise if that makes any sense.

"Hey, /r/Depression/ . I'm not sure whether I want to post here or in /r/SuicidalWatch/ as I'm having mixed feelings.

I'm from the type of people who pays attention to the detail, so let me give you some background. I'm a 19-y-o boy working as a waiter, which job was wrapped up by my grandmother. Yeah, living with my parents, and grandparents. I'm living in a very advanced level of poverty... even this is a miracle considering the chances, in my country, of being employed solely on a diploma.
This is the job I've started off after living 4 months of unemployment. I really f|cking prefer living my whole live unemployed, rather than being employed in such a sh|tty job. ""Why don't you just change your job? Or the very least, change the workplace?"" It's not as simple as that. No one hires. This just as in, because you really do need a good certification or degree from (preferably) the... richest... places. E.g. Microsoft certification, or an Oxford degree.
Now let me tell you about the job I'm stuck on working. Every. goddamn. day. And I'm almost wanting to cry typing this, because it only reminds me of what I'll have to face tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and et cetera. I don't like my job, because co-workers, I don't like the F&amp;B Manager (Food and Bar Manager), I don't like the boss, and the clients, towards which I force myself to have positive feelings, because I'm a waiter, and this is a positive, and a default trait.
I'm an outsider working with not-so-intelligent co-workers, but very experienced in the field. It's because I'm new and know nothing about this genre. No one teaches me anything regarding how to work, and how to work the work. When I try to do something on my own, I usually fail, because no one offers a hand (referred as to teaching), then the staff of the whole hotel (the workplace) gather togheter, talking to each other that I'm incompetent, I'm stupid, they laugh at me, and feel a relief telling me ""You aren't good for anything. Better quit this job as soon as you can. It's the same even if you're working. You're only causing troubles, and issues."" 
A usual worker would think, ""Well, it's not an estimation by a manager."" But the thing is, my co-workers are very close with the manager, and always whine to him how I'm not good for anything. If I try to 'raise my voice' (figuratively), I always get a huge backlash of bullshit. I.e. there has been a problem, and I'm not in fault, but if it is in correlation with the experienced co-workers, it usually is my fault. Kind of a handicap. It got to a point where my manager cuts a lot of tasks, duties, and obligations, because I'm 'incompetent'. Today he saw me trying to carry 2 things at once, and got irritated, then told me by a very unpleased voice and body language 'Just stop trying to multi-task.' But I usually am good in multi-tasking, but the cowardice feeling (anxiety closy-by [It's really not anxiety, but I really do get VERY scared]) of having someone around me that watches what I'm doing, and probably expects the failure. And it really increases the chance of failure.
I really do have a friend of mine in the staff, but this can't really compensate anything. I have (had) friends, with which I've lost contact long time ago, and basically what I'm doing in life currently is go home, sleep, and to work again.

[#The Having Positive Feelings Towards Thoughts Of Death]
I usually watch entertaining or educational videos, which I've watched before, but the difference is that now I don't feel anything. I just feel depression, which cannot leave me. When watching utensils, I get a little uplifting feeling, which is caused by thoughts of harming myself. I really can't do anything about it, nor can you. The premise is that I want to get A LOT of weight off of my burden.

"For over a decade I've been suffering from this disease. Since middle school I've been telling my mother I need help and all she's ever done is dismiss me. Tell me I'm looking for attention or that I just need to snap out of it and be positive. It always made me doubt myself. To this day I question my sanity, is this real or am I just exaggerating?

It sure as hell feels real having been dumped two days ago. When my ex tells me I'll never be happy. When she tells me I make her miserable and I get in the way of my own potential happiness. She told me I ruined our relationship because I never did shit about myself and I'm a miserable asshole. She's right I guess.

I feel utterly worthless and alone.

In my senior year of high school I went through my worst and only other breakup. For almost a year she cheated on me and only told me after she felt guilty enough to do so. It completely destroyed my sense of self-worth and fucked my ability to trust anyone. That definitely had an affect on my relationship with my now recent ex. 

My dad left when I was 10. All I ever saw between him and my mother was constant fighting. That's all I ever knew growing up. My mom tells me I remind her so much of my dad. She seems to hate his guts. 

I have a great job and I'm making great money for someone my age. But because I'm not in school I'm doing nothing with my life. According to my ex I'm doing nothing to better myself because I'm content making the money that I am, I'm okay being financially comfortable instead of wanting to be filthy fucking rich. I have no debt at all and have a sizable savings and putting money towards a retirement. But I'm a lazy asshole because I'm not working towards something bigger. 

It's starting to affect my work life. I barely have a social life. I'm always down and no one wants to be around that. I try to be polite but I'm sure it comes across as disingenuous. I don't even know how to meet people or pretend to be happy enough to try. 

Please excuse my ranting.

The point is, I need to do something. I don't know what. I tried therapy before and it was awful. I can't bring myself to believe that the person sitting there with their notepad gives a fraction of a fuck about the chump feeling sorry for himself. They're just collecting a paycheck. I've always been determined to do things on my own but it's very clear I cannot. I'm doomed to a life of loneliness and emptiness. And I don't want to do this anymore. I can't.",4

"Ok, been thinking about posting here for a while, so here goes. Sorry in advance if I end up typing a wall of text. 

I feel like a failure in multiple aspects of my life, and I'm beginning to wonder more and more why I'm forcing myself into this mediocre, oftentimes miserable existence when i dont see anything to look forward to.

Lets start with my love life - there is none. Im a 26 year old guy and haven't even so much as kissed a girl - pathetic.  I cringe at myself even typing that, but there goes. And anytime some situation occurs where I can ""make a move"", I basically freeze up and back myself out of the situation somehow.  At one point I could say it was because I was afraid of doing something awkward/embarassing, but now I don't even know anymore - somethings wrong with me. 

My work life isn't much better either. I can't say they're terrible jobs (i currently work 2), and I'm fortunate that I get along with all my bosses and coworkers, but they're dead-end jobs, only one of which is related to my degree in graphic design.  Speaking of, i realize I don't want to be doing design either. Others I know in the industry are passionate about what they do,  sketching daily and designing in their free time. Not me - it all seems kind of like a drag at this point, and I usually end up feeling shitty about what I make anyways.  I do stencils and screenprinting stuff on the side,  which I enjoy somewhat more, but with two jobs the time and energy to do these things is lacking.

I only have two jobs to deal with extra expenses stemming from another failure of mine - I got a DUI in 2014, and while I paid back the court and am out of the legal system, i still have high car insurance and owe my parents money. Not to mention the regret of having ever been so stupid to drive in the first place. Its still there. 

I honestly want to do voice acting, like cartoons, games and (if i was fortunate enough)  movies. Its something I feel more passionate, and even more confident about in my ability.  But a large chunk of my mind tells me im going to fail,  that i just think im talented (like one of those american idol contestants who think they can sing), but I'm just a hack. And again, I'm almost 30. I feel like it's too late to get into that kind of industry and expect to be even somewhat successful. So i dont even know where to start. 

Im so afraid of taking any risks in my life,  that I cant really live life at all.  So what's the point in continuing on like this? Drifting from day to same fucking  day? 

I don't think I could commit suicide because it's been something that has effected my family (friends of ours that had done so), and I dont think I could do that to my family.  Even then,  Id probably be too much of a pussy to go through with it anyways.  But Ive been thinking about it more often lately

I just hate who I am, but I'm too scared I'll fuck up again to take the risks and try for the life I want, or that I still don't even know what i want in life anymore. I don't know how to fix it, so why bother sticking around anymore? I'll probably still be just as alone and miserable 20 years from now. 

Thanks for reading my griping if you got this far.",5
"I can't talk to anyone about my depression or tell people how I really feel... it drives me crazy sometimes.

"Well let's start from the beginning so at least someone will know the whole story. I've had depression since I was 8 years old. When I was a kid I was tortured by my entire school. I've been suicidal since I was 12, struggling with addiction since 14 and I am now 23. I've lived my life in a giving manner. Always making sacrifices to help others. I have been feeling lately that I have dug myself too deep to get out. Shit really started to go down hill when I was 17. I was in a happy loving relationship with a girl. It was fantastic we were best friends and shared everything. However she was 2 years younger than me and when I turned 18 her parents called the police. I did 180 days in jail I'm a registered sex offender until I'm 33 and on probation until next February. A little while after I turned 19 I feel in love again with a girl who I had a crush on since the ninth grade. We had a daughter I turned my life around I quit using and for a short period I didn't hate myself anymore I didn't even want to die. God I miss that. I worked nights slept a couple hours and watched my daughter all day while my fiancÃ© was at work while going to school online and managing all of our responsibilities. She left and took my daughter away just before thanksgiving just out of the blue. I tried to get her back. I fought I did everything in my power to get her back but she will not listen. I just want my family back but that will never happen. So tonight I will jump off a bridge into the Mississippi River. I'm done with all of this every time I try to dig myself out I dig the hole deeper. I just wanted to tell someone before I jump to get all of this off my chest and not feel so full of anxiety so I can live my last day with my daughter peacefully.

"So, my husband (25) was diagnosed with depression/anxiety and put on meds at age 11. He hardly knows life without depression. Aside from a few isolated episodes, it's been mostly under control. He's not suicidal or super moody, but he's not living life to the fullest either. He's just...there.

For the last few months, he's been unemployed, still trying to find a solid career. No degree past high school, hoping to get into bookkeeping (trying to take the learn by doing route). Luckily, we get by just fine on my income alone, but I still want him to find a career or something fulfilling to do outside of the home. 

I'd understand if there just weren't any jobs out there (but the job market is pretty good where we live), but we both know full well that he's not putting in sufficient effort to get a job in a timely manner. So at the very least I expect him to be helpful around the apartment, doing dishes, laundry, etc. Or at least try developing a routine so he can feel better (regular exercise, good diet, meditation, structure, etc.) But it's a struggle for him to even do that. He's just constantly drained.

I understand that this comes with the depression package. But I am still conflicted. I'm trying my best to be patient and non-judgmental. But I have a hard time telling if it's his own dang fault, or if it's depression that he can't help. I don't know whether to be angry or compassionate. Is there any way to tell the difference? I fear bringing this up with him too often for fear of making him feel even worse about himself.

Also, I understand that with the current state of depression medication, there is no cure, only things to make depression bearable. We're also apprehensive about changing meds too much since that can bring on a lot of emotional turmoil in the weeks it takes for the new medication to work. But how do you know or judge what is an acceptable level of functioning and what's unacceptable (and calls for a prescription change, therapy, etc)?

TLDR: At what point do you see a therapist/psychiatrist? How much depression (after meds and such) is acceptable? And how do I as his spouse strike a balance between pushing him to be better and being supportive?

"Hello!

I am a 23 year old female that has struggled with anxiety her whole life. I have taken many things but nothing really ""fixed"" me. Xanax and similar drugs just slowed my thoughts but didn't give me the courage or confidence to engage. Antidepressants never helped enough to notice. 

The only thing that ever USED to help, and still does time to time was alcohol. I felt I could speak clearly and engage with all types of people. I had confidence and just loved life. But obviously I can't drink every day nor do I like drinking really.

Depression has always been on and off for me. When I don't have a lot going on I get depressed. I was also pescribed an anti depressant for my migraines from the age of 15-18. I didn't know it was an antidepressant and when I forgot to take it on a trip, I had a complete emotional break down. Safe to say I STOPPED taking it. Now my depression comes and gos.

I also have a stupid past of abusing ""rave drugs.""  I have abused MDMA/molly a few times in the last 2 years. I really was uneducated at the time this could be very bad for someone with my issues and I feel like this past made my depression much worse/an actual problem. Trust me, not doing these things again. (I was very sheltered as a child so moving out was a huge learning experience)

I currently am living a healthy lifestyle. I eat pretty good and workout almost everyday but I just have been feeling HORRIBLE lately..

Extremely depressed. Nothing I used to do for fun is fun anymore. I feel this weight on my chest almost all day/everyday. I feel like all my social interactions are forced. I don't genuinely care what anyone is saying nor care to respond. And when I do to ""seem normal"" nothing comes out right or I just seem so fake.

My anxiety has been very bad. I have very negative thoughts, constantly think about my finance leaving me or people I love dying. Thinking I'm so disgusting. Literally no confidence at all. Going ""blank"" in social situations. Just not feeling human very dissociative. I run my own business and have panic attacks all the time (usually business related things cause this) or arguing.

This unmangiable feeling has been going on for a month now. Alcohol doesn't even seem to help anymore. And this sucks because I am actually very fun, intelligent and funny. I used to be the life of the party (with the help of alcohol or being comfortable with the people I was with) and now I literally can't even force myself to pretend I'm fun.

I hate living this way and really don't want to be on antidepressants.. I want to try something more natural because natural things have worked before. 

Can someone recommend something to me? I've been reading about nootropics the past 2 days and am very interested. 

Thank you!!",3

TLDR: I am a 25 year old male who is enjoying his life, but constantly feels that he is doing more negative than positive things day-to-day in his life.

So going back to the story. As said above in the TLDR i have this weird feeling that i am doing more negative things in my life than positive things day-to-day and i can't seem to shake it off. Let me clarify that feeling, every day when i wake up i feel i am doing more things I DON'T WANT TO DO and LESS THINGS I WANT TO DO! No i am not depressed (at least i think i am not), no i am not sad, but this feeling makes me empty. It all started when i went to college for Bachelors degree. Before that everything seemed fine and i was doing more positive things in life than negative ones. My Bachelors degree went smoothly, i got the degree, i got a decent job (above average pay where i live), i wen't on to Masters degree and from the get go (starting from Bachelors degree) i have this urgency, that i do more things i don't want to do day-to-day and i get no pleasure from it.

Let me bring you an example. I wake up, i go to work. This part i enjoy. Now everything falls apart after work. I have to do this Masters degree and i feel like this is a complete and utter chore to do. Although everyone expect that i must finish this, so i have this pressure on me, that i have to finish this and i want to, but i feel like i am a prison in my own jail. I would gladly workout or hangout with friends, but i can't because from the morning to evening i am at work and after evening till night (sometimes even to 02:00 or 03:00) i do school stuff. I have already burned out once before (where i failed hard on some assignments) and i decided to take less workload. Still i feel like i am always overwhelmed and i can't seem to find free time to be who i want to be, but rather i feel like i have to complete these chores.

Then there is this another thing. I don't get enough respect from others although when problems arise, everyone are running to me for help. For an example, i am an engineer and the university where i am is expanding in the field where i work. I offered my help for anything the answer was ""You should get more experience before offering help"" from the director. After that i was quite confused, because i have been working on my speciality for over 3 years, i have a Bachelors degree, i am looking forward for my Masters degree and when i offer a friendly helping hand i get scolded for no apparent reason. Also when they need some materials from the workplace i work for, then everyone are running for me to ask help.

This helping is expanding to other things as well in life. When my friends are in need of help (lending money or anything else) then everyone are running to me, but i get no credit for it. For one friend i helped him to get a great job opening through my connections and then he was ""Yeah man, thanks for helping me, i will throw you a party"" of course this party never happened and i never got a thanks for it, rather that just thank you and goodbye.

Also at workplace i often get the same ""Disrespect"" treatment from older engineers (since i am a young guy) then i also provide new ideas, new innovative approaches and i seem to never get any respect for it. I have brought new ideas which have improved some systems and then its like ""Well its obvious thanks for the help"", but sometimes i get scolded for no apparent reason like the same from the director. Is this like some kind of an age thing? I don't understand or am i just an idiot.

But the main thing although is this school thing, that some of my classmates who are not even working in their speciality full-time are going more to school and getting more praises like scholarships, director is happy with them and me who is working as a full-time engineer, gets scolded, gets said like ""Get more experience"" although others who have never worked in their speciality. Is this like some kind of an academid circle-jerk they are doing to me? No i am not a fricking loser loner nerd guy, i am quite a self confident guy, but this just makes me so angry that i provide the university materials and experience from my workplace and i get scolded for working and not being full-time academic student? How does this even be logical?

Oeh there are many more things which i could write, but i don't want to drag this out if anyone has any questions or wants to discuss, i would happily open up more.

Thank you,
I just wanted to write this out!",2
"We were all going to the same school. I don't have any friends beside them. I thought they liked me, because we hung out sometimes, but I've recently discovered that they have been partying all together, without me. New Year's Eve was no exception.",4
I think it's because I'm quiet and can't really say what i want to say. Words just come out jumbled always and I'm laconic.,0
"I have so many bad habits and unhelpful coping mechanisms... not to mention the years of personal development that I've missed out on by being too broken to be a functional human being. 

I've become so comfortable with failure that I can't even use the fear of it to motivate myself any more. I'm so accustomed to procrastinating that it feels like success to only miss a deadline once. 

Its so hard to stay motivated to work on getting better when all I'd earn by succeeding is the opportunity to be the same failure of a human being, just without depression as a scapegoat. ",2
I'm at a pretty bad low right now and can't reach out to anyone. This really sucks.,5
I've been emotionally unstable since last night and have been unstable all day. It got to me at around 6 and I've been feeling like shit since. Just so lonely and shitty right now :(,5
I deleted all social media from my phone but I always catch myself trying to check my instagram etc I know this doesnt make me happy cause i never see messages I literally have set dates when i can check back into the accounts what are some tips? This is prob a weird question but yea,5
"I am currently in my friend's restroom breaking down for the last ~30 minutes. Aplogies for the wall of text.

In the eyes of many, I am sure my life is fine. I am moderately attractive with a relatively outgoing personality and decent intelligence. I get lucky with some thing and have the best friend group someone could ask for. Yet despite all this, I still am overwhelemed with depression. To preface, my depression is sometimes caused by outlying causes, but mostly seems to manifest randomly whenever it wants to.

I graduated in 2010 with high expectations from my folks. Nothing too crazy, but significantly better than I performed. With depression and anxiety, I have skipped on many of the opportunities in life (fun, women, careers, etc) and can't seem to truly overcome it entirely. I trick myself into believing it is gone for periods of time, but it inevitably comes back harder than the times previous. I now am sitting in 2018 having accomplished little outside of making a good friend group, and while having gone into business with a close friend, feel like I am the weak partner.

Ultimately my whole life feels like I squandered it and wasted myself when others could've capitalized and lived a happy, fruitful life while my depression and anxiety rules who I am to this day. Frankly, I don't feel deserving of the opportunities I have recieved, regardless of any good I have done. I know it's stupid for someone in my situation to feel this way with so much good in life compared to most others in this subreddit and elsewhere, so i'm sorry.

Hope you all have a good year.",2
Literally no one. I'm not close to my family and everyone I try talking to eventually starts ignoring me. I guess I'm boring or something. Idk they don't even bother telling me why. People on this site sometimes offer to be friends but they just do it to feel like a better person. They end up ignoring me too. I just hate my life. I wish I never had to see anybody so I never felt jealous and could just live out the rest of my loser life alone.,4
"Its my first year in  college and everytime i go  i feel so depressed watching how people as same age as me dating and making friends and partying. they spend in one day the same amount of pocket money that i get for the  whole month. i literally have no friends , i go to the restaurant totaly alone , i spend the free time alone too and i hardly talk to anyone there . I've decided that I'm not going again, this is my third week at home  and i feel less depressed. ",2
"Part of me wants to go to a big NYE party/event tonight, because that's what normal people do on new years - right? I would spend a bunch of money on taxis, booze, event tickets etc.. all to be *normal*. 


That's what I usually do, but I'm not in the mood for it this year..


It all feels so pointless to me now. Sure, it'll be depressing knowing that everyone else will be out tonight having fun, but it's all so superficial; get drunk, yell happy near years, feel like crap in the morning and resume regular life the next day. No matter what I chose to do I'll still be depressed. I don't want to celebrate with strangers, but I also don't want to be alone tonight..",5
"When I was in high-school, I screwed up any and every opportunity to get into Ivy League by getting suspended.

I also just lost my scholarship to my current college because I didn't get the minimum GPA required this past semester. Though my dad is paying for my education, I don't want to burden him unnecessarily. So yes, it pains me that I lost the scholarship. And my first real girlfriend (of nearly a year) just left me in the middle of that semester. She's not coming back, either.

Guys, my resting bitch-face is turning into resting Slav-face. (No offense to genetically Slavic people...That was just the best analogy I could come up with.) That's how terrible I feel. Nothing has made me smile genuinely for more than a second--and the best ""smile"" that I've even had lately was just changing my current face into what would be my neutral expression if I were happy. Not even memes make me laugh like they should. Not even when someone else shows me one, it doesn't; and I'm not faking it because that would honestly require too much effort out of me.

I lack so much energy that it takes me thirty minutes to get out of bed. And no, I'm not on my phone or anything. I just lay there. I don't even think about anything while I lay, either; I quite literally lay in bed for thirty minutes and struggle to actually get up. And what's worse is that I don't wake up by my own volition. My dad comes in and wakes me up. Speaking of that...My own dad told me on Christmas Eve that I was ruining Christmas by being lazy and noncompliant with him. He yelled at me and told me that I was to ""change [my] attitude"" or leave the house. It's not an attitude. I don't know what to otherwise call it, though.

What's worse is that my dad hasn't let me outside of the house for the past three weeks since my break from college started. He told me ""You're going to be productive while you're on your break. The only way to succeed in college is by doing more than what's required of you."" So I've been reading my English book two months in advance and answering all the guided-reading questions that correspond to each passage from dawn until dusk. I've gotten barely any sunlight whatsoever--and this only because I have a window in my room. And I haven't gotten exercise at all.

Besides the lethargy that I've been feeling, my metabolism has went to absolute shit. I haven't eaten more than a meal-and-a-half each day...and I'm talking about ""normal-person""-sized meals: normal portions...and I'm bigger than a normal person. I weigh, like, 100 kilograms (226 lbs)...yet I've been eating like an anorexic person. In fact, I was sick earlier this vacation and vomited anything that went into my system. I literally couldn't even eat a sandwich for two straight days. And I've been sick with standard cold/flu symptoms for the past week or so.

Even my sleeping schedule is off. A normal, healthy person sleeps eight hours every day. I've tended to sleep much longer than that...and I still don't feel well-rested at all. No amount of earplugs to drown out external noise nor sleeping-masks to prevent sunlight from awakening me has actually led me to a good night's rest. I tried NyQuil, too...but that didn't give me rest. It just drained my energy and forced me to sleep. It didn't give me rest at all, though.

If I can't change this...this intense feeling of malaise, I'm not sure what I can do. I guess I'll just go to my J-term class and see if I can't pretend that it's all O.K. Maybe I'll suddenly feel better if I just can pretend...hopefully...

But the thing is that this sadness is beyond tears; beyond simple and vague melancholia. It is an emptiness; a void. Since my mother isn't really in the picture (and so only my father is really here), I guess I could say in German: ""Ich fÃ¼hle mich mutterseelenallein."" And I do feel deserted. But I know I deserved it. I deserve everything bad that's ever happened to me and that will ever happen to me, because I'm such a screw-up. Even my own existence is a mistake. I was adopted at birth from two people who had a one-night-stand and no intentions of ever getting married with each other. Okay, yeah, they loved me and wanted me to have life. Thanks to them.

And thanks to my adoptive mom and dad for having fed, clothed, and sheltered me...but my adoptive dad doesn't love me like he should. He wanted a child whom he could be proud of. When that didn't work for my older brother, he focused all of his yelling and threats on me...and I've been forced into subordination or else exile. He's made me into something that I'm not, and I'm not comfortable. But I don't even know what I am, because I've been forced so much to be something that I'm not. But this isn't about how my dad fails to acknowledge mental health issues; this is about how much of a terrible person I am--and I am very much such a person.

I won't go into the details, but the reason I got suspended back in high-school was because I made an ironic and edgy joke about killing myself. (Say what you will about me; any rebuke just furthers the point that I am the scum of the Earth.) No, I wasn't suicidal. I was just into extremely offensive humor at the time.

I also am a long-time user of pornography. I have seen unclad women since I was ten. Now I'm eighteen and have the worst imaginable sexual kinks. I'm so fucked-up that I have a thing for torture and pain. And at this point, there can be no argument that I might ever do anything BDSM as an act of love. At best, I'd do it as an act of self-pleasure because I so lack love--although even if someone would want to do it with me, I'm not sure I'd even be able to. I've had rapid bursts of sexual urges followed by long (multi-day) periods of not having the slightest feeling of wanting to relieve myself since this break started. I'm sure that any girl with enough sex-drive to even tolerate BDSM would want it several times a day. So I wouldn't even satisfy such a girl.

And, despite the above, I believe in God. I don't want to do anything outside of marriage, which further proves my fucked-upness. Besides the fact that, even from a secular point-of-view, I'm fucked-up, I now am doubly so fucked-up from a Christian perspective. And all happiness is supposed to come from God. So I guess I'm so fucked-up that not even God wants to make me happy or something. I guess He wants to emphasize how much of a misbegotten shit I am.

As someone of illegitimate birth--as someone who could have been slaughtered just as easily as adopted--I am against the notion of abortion. In all ways, I am against it; even in cases of rape. I believe in the forgiveness of others (and yet I wonder whether I, too, will be forgiven?) because I find abortion to be punishment against a child for the sins of its parents. Someone who could have become a very close friend to me has just blocked me on Facebook because of my stance. I guess, besides not being good enough for Ivy League nor for affordable college nor for kindness from my father nor for happiness from God, I'm also not good enough even for friends. Literally everyone who likes me doesn't know me whatsoever. Anyone whom I ever hang out with starts to drift away from me after maybe two hang-out-sessions. And I'm heavily introverted: I don't just âlook for new friendsâ like that--but besides that it's socially uncomfortable for me to seek others in such a manner, it's also futile. I am unloved and have almost zero confidence that I will ever be loved--especially not by myself.

The worst part of this all is that a hobby of mine is composing and playing music. At the absolute maximum, I've done that for perhaps three hours out of three weeks. (And I feel as though it would be the same even if my dad would let me do whatever I wanted.) If I weren't such a disappointment and a mistake, I would easily do it for six hours every day...but, alas, I am a mistake. So I haven't even been doing the things I like to do...

And at this point, after much reflection on how bad of a person I am, I'm not sure whether I'll be happy again. I'm not asking for help, though. I just wanted to...You know what? I don't even know why I wrote this, nor why I bothered to. I don't care about support. Love doesn't exist in my life like it does in others'. I don't even care about getting it off my chest. I just felt like having my voice heard, perhaps. Whatever.",2
"she found out i was bisexual and she started on about what i'd do when it's time to get married. i tried to rationalise but she just goes that my future would be ruined by my abnormality.

"I used to be a complete loner and outcast until my early twenties, now I am a bit better communicator but still nobody really likes me and wants to hang out with me, I don't really interact with anyone, only in certain situations and temporarily, but I have literally 0 friends, male or female. 

Since this is the way it has been for my entire life, I have long ago accepted this and not really worried about it but I knew I was missing out on a lot, especially stuff like house parties, etc... But at this point I am pretty much over it and I would be happy enough if I ever had a girl, but that seems like an impossible task also. ",5
"So I had a bad night. Something I'm sure all or most of you guys can relate to. I decided that I would check out this sub to see if there was anything here that could help me. I saw so much pain and suffering and few hopeful pieces of advice, and i would like to add to this in some way. I have felt bad about myself for the longest time. No one tells you as a kid that there's gonna be low moments in your life and there isn't a guide on how to get through them. Sometimes I feel like I'm doing something wrong, like I shouldn't feel the way I do or say the things I say, but I realize that I'd never trade that for the world. I understand myself so much better now. I'm unique, funny, quirky, friendly, social and truthful. Not because other people say so, but because I believe that to be the truth. I don't wake up and slap on an adjective, I become the person I want to be and then I live my life. What I want to get across is that each of us have a really powerful choice (albeit a really difficult choice with a lot of commitment) to decide how we get to shape ourselves and our lives. I'm poor, I can't drive just yet (I'm 17 btw) and it's hard to get to work. I have a really bad relationship with my family, I feel like a failure sometimes and I have thought about suicide on multiple occasions but I never give up. It isn't in my nature. Tonight was a hard blow and I nearly didn't make it, but I'll never give up. I'll never perish when I can make the choice to be strong. I chose how I live and only I can make the change and see it through. Anyone can make a choice, but only the strong stay with it. I love myself and I hope whoever reads this can or at least will too.  ",5
Even though some of my friends tell me otherwise I still feel guilty of what I've done and unworthy of everything,4
"A Sinus Infection Ruined my Life. 

Dude. It's Fucked. 

I wasn't supposed to be like the way I am.

I changed a few details to protect anonymity. If you need to match me with a name, feel free to know me as Mitchell. 

I had it all: the grades, the friends, the talent... I had it all. 

I was the best at everything I did. I was that guy you hated. I was him. 

Then I had a sinus infection. My life was fucked over by a sinus infection. I wish I was joking. 

Well, I didn't exactly know I had a sinus infection. The doctors didn't know either:

I vomited multiple times a day; I suffered from extensive head aches; I felt broken because no one knew what was wrong. 

I saw gastroenterologists because of the vomiting. They couldn't figure it out.

I saw allergists because they thought I had allergies. They were wrong.

I saw countless other doctors. 

I then saw a neurologist (God bless). I had an MRI and a CT.

Just that alone was enough to ruin me (I knew that they were looking for tumors). 

Because of the scans, we found a sphenoid sinus infection. I know this is a strong thing to say, but I wish it was a tumor; it would have been easier. 

They gave me super strong antibiotics (without probiotics... :c). Basically, in short, the antibiotics fucked over my digestive system and created very fun trips to the potty. It lasted for a while. One complication over another. My body was compromised and malnourished. I was getting close to looking like a skeleton (I just read over everything I have written so far, and realized I missed a ton of things. Let's just say it ended up a lot worse than how I described it).

This all happened over a period of 323 days (I started counting at day 3). 

I attempted to step back into school and failed miserably. I now had social anxiety because of a few obvious reasons. 

I lost my hobbies, my friends, my girlfriend, and myself.

Overtime, the anxiety led to me learning and âdoing school' from home. 

Being socially isolated led to depression. 

Seriously, the tumor would have been better.

Let's skip through the nasties of depression (this is a subreddit about depression, I'm sure we don't need a review). 

I came out the other side of the long and dark tunnel into another long and dark tunnel. I had treatment resistant depression (I've seen multiple psychotherapists and tried almost every type of cocktail they could throw at me). 

I continued finishing up my high school career with a clouded mind. I was depressed all the time (anxiety gone, thank god). I couldn't focus on anything. I had no energy to do anything.

Let's hop to the last two months.

I asked for adderall to just help me focus on my school work so I could just keep moving on (until I figured out how I wanted to end things with myself).

Adderall... ADHD...? Nope! Adderall = Treatment resistant depression!

No joke. The adderall gave me energy. It gave me life. It helped my focus on what is ahead of me. It gave me the urge to go be me. I started to become -excited- about going out of my house and doing homework. 

This is where I am now. 

I'm doing homework. I'm talking to people. I'm being what I think I am supposed to be. Well... when I can... :c

Adderall is my antidepressant. It's the only thing that works. Even with XR Adderall... it only lasts for about 5 hours. I am only allowed to take two a day (insurance blows now). 

So, I only get about 9 hours a day to be... well me. Happy, energetic, and beautiful. Then I start to fall down the abyss that we all know. Some nights I fall deep. Some nights it's only a few feet. 

I'm not really happy me because happy me isn't sad half of the day. 

I'm cheating depression. It's always there and I don't give it the respect that it deserves. It doesn't respect me.

I have a feeling this will be the rest of my life. 

I'm lost now. 

I wasn't supposed to be like the way I am.

Dude. It's fucked. ",3

Anyways I offered to my new friend group that I would host a New Years party at my house and they like were really into it but oddly controlling. I invited 2 of my older friends but unknown to me my new friend group had problems with them.

"Hello. First of all, i apologize about my English. I'm 17yo and I do not usually speak english. I'll do my best for sure.
I'll present myself shortly : 
I'm a 17yo white boy in Western Europe, 1m85 tall. Diagnosed HIQ ( 144, with a IQ verbal/IQ perf rate = ~1,3 ) at the age of 10 and dealing with ego problems, i've been depressed the two last years because of hyper-empathy ( a fucked up word to explain that my exgirlfriend's rape's story traumatized me. ) and social awkwardness. ( I've got few friends that i've known since elementary school which i love, but furthermore, i have never been a sociable person. )
So, after those two years of moderate to severe depression, I've been going better the last three months, since i've definitely broke up with my toxic ex-girlfriend, but i'm recently going worse since i met this other girl. We met each other two and a half month ago. This night, I was crying so badly because of my ex when she came to me and gave me a hug. She took care of myself, she heard me, she told me her own story, and then we slept together. Since this night, we have been dating each other. 
She has been so nice with me all this time long.
Two months later, i'm feeling as if i'm not deserving her. By induction, i'm feeling as if i wouldn't ever been able to be happy with anyone due to my low self esteem. ( That was already a problem during my last love-relationship. )
I've already use to struggle with depression, but what panics me is that i'm in graduating class and I have to succed it if i wan't to have a nice CPGE ( preparatory classes to prestigious universities ) and thus i would more likely get a well ranked university. 
I'm feeling lost. I don't have any idea about what i should do, if I should leave her asap to flee my own problems, if finally works shouldn't have the priority for once and i should focus about myself, or if i'm not seeing the most important here...
Thanks to you if you read me, that was pretty difficult for me to write ""non-academicly"" in English. If i did loud ( or even slight, but it should contains a lot and i wouldn't take up too much of your time ) mistakes, i would be glad to learn and improve my English, by the way. Have a nice day or a nice evening. It's 4a.m. for me while i'm writing this. ",4

"So the thing here is I stopped caring about my reputation. I care nothing about keeping a good reputation and some of my friends warned me about keeping a 'good' reputation.

Do I have to 'fake' being a polite girl? I know it's because I have different cultures but I don't feel like it's myself or me.Do I really have to change myself? Do I have to stop doing this kind of attitude? What did I do wrong here? I didn't even realised when I stopped caring about anyone or anything, it just happened.

Does anyone else feel like this? Every morning I stay in bed for as long as I can because getting up feels impossible. Starting the day feels impossible. I'm trying to change my life and I am trying to be more positive. I'm even getting professional help now. But still getting up in the morning is so damn hard. ,2
"I've been with depression for about a year now and right now I think I am at my worst. The thoughts of ending it all are going through my head more than I've ever had it before and it's because I have a solution to my pain but that solution will only cause more pain for me in a different way. I don't know what to do and I feel like I need some help. 

My decision revolves around my religion. I am a member of the LDS church and have been all my life. I was raised with it and I believed in it to the full extent. However nowadays church is a pain to go to and anything having to do with god is like a pin prodding at me. Church has turned into a shaming session where when I do go I hear the speakers talk about certain things and I always come to the decision that they are talking to me and pointing out what I should be doing. Even in Sunday school I feel like that's happening. So to avoid this I go to church and play on my phone the whole time which is not the point of being their in the first place. So I feel like I go and ruin the next couple days for myself or I go and feel like a rude asshole for not paying attention when I'm in class or in sacrament. 

So the solution to this problem is obviously just not going but I fear that the things that will come of that will destroy me and my family even more. My dad is very connected to the religion and heir already seeing my falling away and I can tell he's disappointed. I feel like I'm failing him and that leaving will only make it worse. Not only that is there my brother who is unstable and has anger and control issues who I think that if I leave he will follow. That is not what he needs and I think the church is the best thing for him so the idea of him leaving is not something I want to see happen. Not only that but if he leaves my father will probably be even more disappointed not only for me But for my brother. 

I need to come to a decision here but both options are awful. I can either be selfish and leave while ruining my family in the process or stay and endure my pain and hatred of myself for the rest of my life. I have lost hope in myself and hopefully you guys have some idea what to do cause I'm sitting in bed crying over this situation. 

Thanks for reading, hopefully I didn't make you depressed in the process",5
And I just had a breakdown in front of my family and friends. Fantastic.,4
"Decided to go to my new primary care doctor in order to get a referral for my acute sleep apnea problem I've had since childhood. Decided because this was the first time seeing a doctor in several years, maybe I should get what is supposed to be an annual checkup(blood test, ekg, etc.). The first thing the doctor asked me was âare you feeling down lately? Are you depressed?â



I kind of shrugged and laughed âehh I don't think soâ. She smile and told me it was all part of the checkup.


I told her I wasn't feeling down, but I'm not too sure about my answer which is why I'm here. I'm going to try my best to provide all symptoms and events in order for you guys to get some idea of what I'm going through.



Let's start off with the doctor visit. Out of the blue, I started walking outside again; in the dead of winter no less. I liked to blame my tendencies to stay locked up at home on my laziness, but now I find myself taking a stroll around my neighborhood every once in a while. I never really thought I was a full blown hikikomori as I've maintained a job for a short period where I had to interact with customers.,. I live in a very busy part of New York so there are many faces to look at and imagine where they're all headed.


I recently applied for college as a returning student for the spring semester which is why I think it may just be anxiety or even college-mid life crisis because I am doubting my career path.



I need to prep for some of the classes as I have forgotten a lot f the materials.. it's been a good year since I've gone to college. I know I should be studying, but I seem to be pushing the schedule back. I even planned out my schedule on my calendar app, but I end up just deleting the notifications and telling myself that I'd do it tomorrow. I hate this part about myself because I feel this is what led me to fall so behind in school. Everyone of my peers who've I've cut contact with have already graduated and live a decent life, meanwhile I've quit my job as a store clerk months ago and don't know where the time went.




Activities? I stopped gaming but many people get into a period of malaise with this. I seem fill most of my day on reddit and watching shows when I'm not walking around outside.





 I move around the house aimlessly; idk what the deal with that is. I find myself walking into the kitchen and forgetting why I went there. I think I'm just watching what I eat. I've lost a couple of pounds which is great.



My sleep schedule is screwed but I am not forcing myself to say in bed longer than I have to. I actually hate laying down with nothing but my thoughts because my mind drifts into odd places that make me sad. I wonder what would've happened if my mother didn't have issues with the first child. That would mean I would have never been born; my parents had me because the first one didn't take.


Anyway I think about shit like that so I like to minimize my time laying in bed with nothing else but my thoughts so I end up watching shows on my tablet til I fall asleep. 


I've also never been good with sleeping near electronic devices since I was a kid. Just bad habits I think.


I haven't attempted or even fantasized about leaving here so I guess that's good. I have written an apology letter to my parents though and I'm scared to know what the intent of that was.




Well I hope it's not depression because I'm about to get on a medication that has a known side effect that can potentially amplify the sadness. This might be a mess to read through.",2

Seems like suck a depressing reality and that's all I think about on a constant basis, This is the root of my depression.

"I've never been for myself, but I have been often to visit my mom as a teen, and now I'm watching this show on Netflix called ""Don't Call Me Crazy"" about teenagers in a psych ward. I guess it's just the idea of no responsibilities/obligations that's appealing right? And no stressful changes of environment. Just staying in the same place all day with nothing to do. Jesus, that seems like heaven to me. (I know that's the crazy-brain talking.)",4
"Throwaway because SO knows my username. 

I'm a graduate student in a field I've always wanted to be in, working with a world-renowned adviser; I have a supportive family, am relatively attractive and intelligent, and a great SO. By all accounts should be thrilled with the life I'm living. Obviously I'm not or I wouldn't be posting here. 

My motivation is basically gone, as is my confidence in myself and my passion for the work I'm doing. All I want to do is lie around and watch TV all day, and lately, that's all I've been able to do. My goal yesterday was to make it out of bed before 12 pm. 12 PM!!!! I'm an adult, that's ridiculous! 

I was a vegan for moral reasons for a long time, was a healthy eater, cooked nightly, and was in great shape from tons of yoga and working out. Now, I'm lucky if I do some light stretching and cook once a week.

I can't focus on anything. Trying to get work done is like running uphill in two feet of snow holding a bag of rocks. When I try to concentrate it feels like there is a cloud in my head that information can't get through. It's so frustrating and exhausting and I just can't handle it anymore. 

I've always had obsessive thoughts, and had a bit of OCD as a teenager, but now they're just constant and are affecting every aspect of my life. I know they're not rational, and I know not to let myself get fooled into believing them, but when I'm as vulnerable as I have been lately it's a challenge. 

It's taken me months to accept the fact that I might be depressed and not just a lazy, unmotivated pos, even though that's what I feel like. I've struggled with making excuses for myself and my behavior all my life; my mother rationalizes everything she does and never takes responsibility when she isn't handling things the way she should, and I think I've overcompensated in the wrong direction. This acceptance is a huge, painful step for me but I'm proud of myself for finally getting here. I think I need to accept that I need help and can't combat this alone. This isn't something to be ashamed of, it's something to confront head on and something the great, supportive people in my life can help me with. 

Anyway, I guess this was more of an /r/offmychest post, but I figured this would be a good place to vent. If you're still reading, thanks for that. ",3

"Nothing Happens


Staring at the white wall I trace the rectangular patterns with my wet eyes and the pain strikes me again along with the voices. âGaby, you're such a fuck up why are you even alive?â I cover my ears while I shake my head repeatedly. I lose control. In a plane falling out of the sky what can one do but brace for death? Every negative happening that's ever happened is replaying in my head, spun around where I've become the problem. The angle of death. The one thing that makes sure everything goes wrong. I see this seemingly true image of myself and I feel disgusted. The voices start yelling ugly words at me digging at my festering wrists. They wanna see blood but I wont give it to them. My whole body shaking, little puddles of tears on the floor, eyes like a madwoman the voices start screaming. Banging my head against the wall until my fight for survival becomes a fight for death I slump down, my head throbbing with a sharp pain in my skull. I laugh.

 âIt's too quiet in this restroom.â ",1
"I'm tired of worrying my friends and loved ones by posting things where they can see them so I just made this account to talk here. Talk of self harm to follow, sorry. Also it's kind of my life story lol.

I started thinking about killing or hurting myself in high school- the summer between freshman and sophomore year I just took a fucking nosedive. I totally retreated into my head, cut off every friend I had made my first year besides literally two. I took an exacto knife from art class and started cutting my hips (because no one would see them there.) The only person who saw was my best friend while I was changing at her house. She's not someone who shows a lot of emotion, but I'd never heard her gasp like that or seen her as shocked and hurt as I did right then. To this day, she's the only person who knows I do that. (Also, somehow, she was willing to date me and we are still together 7 years later.) 

I barely passed high school (I think the only reason I didn't go to summer school is because they literally forgot about me.) I remember once admitting to the guidance counselor I hurt myself, and it was a huge force of effort for me to admit that. All she said was âThat's not good,â and I never saw her again. I have no idea why I told her and not the actual therapist I was seeing at the time. The therapist might have done something. 

Then I tried college. I somehow go into a decent art school. My freshman year was absolutely fucking miserable. No friends (well, one, but we never did anything besides hang out in our rooms), horrible roommate, tanking grades. I just stopped showing up to class at one point near the end of the year because I knew it was pointless. The small scholarship I had somehow managed to get (which I think was just a result of me coming from an inner city school) was taken away within the first semester. I had just thought I might not have been able to do traditional school, but maybe I would do well in art school. Clearly, I was wrong. Obviously I dropped out. I told my parents I was taking a gap year but...lol. We all knew it was a lie. Three years later and I have zero plans to go to any college at all. 

I constantly make jokes about me dropping out around my friends and parents. I've always done that; deflecting my pain with humor. I guess I think if I joke about it enough it'll stop hurting so much. What's even harder is I am still close friends with my one college friend- and they are graduating in a few months from what I view as my biggest failure. 

All my friends are going to college and doing well. My girlfriend is getting an accelerated master's degree. She's very school smart and has always done very well. I'm going with her to a networking party in a month or so as her plus one- I'm going to support her but I'm afraid I'm just going to start crying being surrounded by all these successful people because I know I will never be that. I'm so scared I'm going to drag her down for the rest of her life. She's so smart and driven and is going to be very successful and I am going to work a shitty retail job like I have now for the rest of my life. I know she loves me but every time she tries to compliment me and tell me that I have value I just get angry because I feel like she's just saying that. My brain shuts down when people try to talk to me about my future because I can barely picture myself being alive tomorrow, let alone in a few years. 

I never cut every day, just when I was feeling intense emotional pain that needed to be let out somehow. I've never made it a full year without doing it- but some years I've gone 6 or 7 months without. But lately I've been thinking about it constantly. I just keep a knife in my room now for easy access. I had a party with several friends last week. After they all left, I felt lower than I had in months. It was Christmas Eve, and I was just lying in bed sobbing and bleeding from my hips. I have several plans for events and trips in january- and yet I can't get excited for them or feel anything at all. I feel like things are going to get very bad for me (even worse than they have been) very soon. And the worst part is that it's almost a comforting thought.

"Sometimes i get these waves of immense sadness. I remember having them as a kid. It doesn't occur that often now as it did then. I noticed that it happens when i'm dressing up or know i'm going out somewhere. for some reason, that seems to be the trigger most of the time, sometimes it's not. 

When i was a kid, i didn't think of it much. It's like 'this happens and i'm sad for some reason'' and it lasted briefly. 5 min max. I googled these waves and experiences were pretty similiar to mine from what i've read. But people there seemed to be on some medication and i never was.

I was as young as six, when i remembered the feelings of these waves. It felt like pure sadness and dread. It would get me so out of nowhere too. My heart would suddenly feel too heavy and it seemed like it would slide down from all that weight it was suddenly carrying.

I kinda felt like i wasn't in my body either. Nothing too extreme but detached kinda. Like i was talking normally and moving normally too, but it felt like something was doing that for me and i was so small in my body, somewhere in the background, watching.

Just wanted to share that's it",5
"So like many of us,  I've suffered from anxiety and depression for my entire adult life. Pretty severe depression to be honest. 

About 5 years ago I started taking Celexa under my general practitioners recommendation ,   and it was incredible.  It made a huge difference in every way possible and it was like I was a new person.

Eventually I (stupidly) weaned off it,  thinking I was ""cured"" and went for about 2 ish years not on any meds.   Eventually I predictably fell back into my depression. 

Went back to the doctor.   We tried celexa again-   didn't work.   wasn't anything like the first time.   then put me on wellbutrin-  didn't really work either.    then we finally tried effexor-  same deal,  didn't notice any positive changes. 
I don't exactly remember but I believe we also tried upping the dosages of these meds also.  

i'm getting increasingly frustrated and unsure of what to do.   i've been struggling finding the right meds now for years.   I would give anything to go back to that ""clear, happy"" feeling I got from my first batch of celexa.  but i've not been able to find it.  

does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions for me?  what is the next step?   any other meds that I might recommend to my doctor to try next? ",3
"Long story short, I have long suspected that I have at least a mild form of depression. 

I function okay on the day-to-day and present ""normal"" and am not suicidal, but I go through waves where I become extremely upset (a.k.a. ball my eyes out about the state of my life every few months) and deep down I am pretty chronically unhappy with my life, although I try to avoid thinking about this very often because it just makes me sad. 

I come from a family of high achievers that doesn't believe in this kind of stuff (if i were to say I am depressed, they will just say you are lazy, in a funk, etc.) and I am broke/do not have health insurance (so therapy/meds out of the question). 

Is there an online test or something I can take to see if I have depression? Obviously I know it cannot take the place of a medical professional, but that isn't an option for me right now. 

Thanks for any help and I was so glad to discover this sub!",4
"... Trouble comes when natural winter melancholy turns into a deeper sadness that isn't easily shed.

"3 years ago I moved in with a drunk. A man who drank at least a whole bottle of vodka a day. He would do the most random crazy shit he would punch a flat screen tv countless times for no reason, beat his girlfriend and bruise her, head butt her mom and scream and yell. One time he forced us to leave with his girlfriend at 12pm in the rain and we had to walk down the road until the cops came and  asked if we were okay. Things like this happened all the time. My bedroom was right under there's and I was forced to listen to them scream at each other and his girlfriend crying and screaming ,things getting thrown, her being thrown around and then having sex. I lived with them for 3 years and the final year I noticed a difference in myself. My room was kept constantly dark I would sleep all night get up and go to school and then come home and go right back to sleep when I was up all I could do is read for hours or watch tv blankly. I started to be rude to my mom and my family members. Whenever they would come in my room I would yell at them to get out (I'm pretty sure they just think I'm a cunt) before all this happend I got into a relationship with someone I didn't want to be with because I was being reckless. the last year I broke up with her (I don't even like woman either but I still dated her) I started to eat way to much and I started to stop talking. I missed a lot of school to the point where my mom was almost brought to court. I don't know if this matters but my style started to change and the music I listened to. I had no energy or motivation. At the time I didn't know I was depressed I just knew I was unhappy. 

Right now I have to share a room with my brother since we are staying with someone until we find our own place. The darkness comes out when I'm alone, and rn I'm constantly around someone which threw me into this state of numbness. It gave almost the complete opposite affect I can't eat I can't sleep I don't want to do anything and I'm still unhappy. I miss sleep. I want to come home and sleep so that the days will go  by until we get our house. I just want to sleep forever

"Where do I start? I guess the background: I am in nursing school, and this past semester broke me, I developed anxiety, and my depression returned. I have been since medicated with prozac, and it helps. I don't feel nearly as hopeless, I don't feel worthless, I feel like me, before all this stress.

Well last night, about 11pm, I had an intrusive thought, that I should just die, and I should just get it over with. Now to be fair, I had a plan IF I failed second semester, which I did not do. I even just came home from the area I would do it in. I commonly have thoughts that wonder what my eulogy would be, but honestly I attributed that to my natural curiosity. 

This thought, it felt different, it felt real, and it scared me. I felt odd, my BP shot up, my pulse plunged, I felt short of breath but my o2 saturation was normal. I monitored it every 15 min, for an hour, and when it wasn't changing I took myself to the hospital. It was there that I realized what had just happened. 

You see, I am a migraine sufferer with a rare condition, my migraines are rarely painful, most just a headache, but the auras, they fucking SUCK. My first one ever mirrored a stroke, my second one I went partly blind for an hour, with all of them I had a change in how I talk. 

When I opened my mouth to talk, for the first time since feeling this way, I realized it was a migraine, but I was scared. I had a thought that I have had once before in my life, and it was terrifying to me. My voice sounded robotic, like something you would expect someone having severe asthma would talk like. My tremors were exacerbated where it was difficult to sign my name. They take me back, and all my symptoms are still there, and I am put on suicide watch while they page the psychologist. Here I am, 30 years old, some people consider me the most stable person they know, when I told them that I started antidepressants the general comments were along the lines of: no surprised you would be willing to reach out for help.  

So I sit like the fraud I am. Wanting to make sure I am medically OK, and mentally OK. I knew as soon as I had the invasive thought that I would not act on it, but it felt so real, and scary. Well turns out auras from migraines in depressed people can cause these thoughts. Fuck. Me. 

So about 4am they discharge me when I tell them that I am not going to act on my impulse, and that I don't have a plan, and I will see outpatient. I feel like a sham, I am embarrassed, It felt like that wasn't me there. 

Thank you for reading, and I hope we all can overcome this.",3
"TLDR One can often feel fine mentally, but be unable to present this to the world, because the body manifests depression so thoroughly on a physical level. The face and body present depression, to the point where its literaly impossible to smile or convey any genuine impression of yourself, even though you should otherwise be mentally fine.  


...


Example, I wake up in the morning, my mood is more or less fine and i feel ready to go to work and go about my day. I get out of bed and i feel a little stiff and achy, maybe dehydrated. 

Go to the bathroom and in the mirror Im like ""Oh no, what the fuck is that!?"" I look unbelievably sad and unhealthy, my eyes are hollow and look sad and weak, I dont recognise myself in this face at all. I summon up the emotions that made me quite confident yesterday, but they barely register on the face. Its impossible to smile, it looks like a grimace. 

I soend half an hour in front of the mirror trying to force myself to look normal and composed, but every time i turn back and catch myself again i see this shell emanating horrible vibes. 

Again, i didnt wake up feeling this way, I wasnt even aware of it until i became aware of myself physically by 1) moving around and 2) observing myself. 

You end up almost late for work because you cant convince yourself to leave the house. It might even be easier if you were mentally down, at least that would fit with your physical self image now. 

People at work say, ""Ive not seen you so depressed, whats got you down"", or ""I think i know what youre sad about"". But for all that, it is nothing in particular you're down *about* - it is a physical thing. 

You just want your face to cheer up and your shoulders to relax so you can be yourself, but its physically impossible. There are no tricks or thoughts that will lift you out of it. The subtlest or most powerful *thought* doesnt matter because your body is not physically expressing what is happening inside. 

We always talk about depression as a *mental* illness but in my experience its the physical factors that predominate, and to such an extent that the ability to deal with it mentally *almost doesnt matter*. You can have your thoughts in order but what your body is presenting to the world physically is an impossible barrier to overcome.

"For years, I have battled depression. I have battled suicidal ideations. I thought to myself, hospitalization and IOP would do the trick. Would get me out of this state. However, I realized a few days ago, maybe a week, that IOP doesn't give a shit about me. They just care about my insurance copay.

I am tired. I realized that I will never get better. My life is shit. I don't care about my job, I am barely hanging on to my life in general. I am losing friends by the minute. Why the fuck does my life even matter?

I just wish I had a gun, a rope, something, to end this misery. That's what I am right now, miserable. Not just now, for the past week, I have been miserable. But, the fact of the matter is, I don't want to get better anymore. The only way people know how treat me is to hospitalize me or IOP me or PHP me etc... These solutions clearly don't solve the problem.

Maybe this is my farewell note to the world, I don't know. I just need an exit strategy that limits the fallout. I don't want to shoot myself because that's too nuclear. I wish there was a full proof way of OD'ing. That way my family (the last vestige of people who care) would be able to see me at peace.

"I'm 6'4"", 36 years old, and have the typical dad bod physique, so it's been as long time since I've taken a bath.  It's just not practical in the least. As I type, I've got maybe a third of my body actually submerged, and that's just how it goes for large people in a typical tub. 

Anyway, that's not at all the point of my post, I just wanted to give some frame of reference for my state of mind. Today I've reached a new low, I feel utterly hopeless, sad, and lonely. So much so that some primal urge to crawl back into the womb prompted me to draw a bath in an attempt to find some basic comfort. 

I'm married and have a 6 year old daughter; my daughter just knows that mom and dad fight a lot, which is bad enough, so I'm trying to spare her in any way I can manage. It's impossible not to let depression impact a close family relationship, even when it's the single most important relationship in your whole life.  My wife has struggled with depression herself, but she's little help in this situation, and often only serves to make it worse. 

As I sit here in the tub, mostly exposed to the cold air, partially submerged in rapidly cooling water, I'm trying to figure out how I even got here. Did I really make such poor decisions in my life? Is everything that has brought me to this state entirely my fault? And that's when it hit me; the ultimate analogy for life as it applies to my current situation: Life is a journey. This is not a new metaphor for life, and all of what just occurred to me has likely occurred to many others, but it was an important revelation that I at least wanted to share. 

Life is a journey, we all have to make choices that determine where we'll end up; our ultimate destination. I have always known that I've made poor decisions in my life that have put me on a more difficult path, but I've also had circumstances outside of my control that have also had significant impact. Some people are fortunate enough to have support and guidance in their journey, from people who have done well or been lucky in their life choices. That's wonderful, I envy that tremendously. 

For those of us who didn't have that benefit, it means flying blind a lot of the time. Imagine that you are driving somewhere really far off that you've never been to before and all you've got is a super vague map with most of the route completely missing. Sure everyone's life is like that to a degree, but some people have those they can ask for directions, people who are invested in their successful journey. A lot of us don't have that, so every turn is a roll of the dice. Some get it right, some get it wrong, some find immediate disaster. 

I feel like the last fifteen years or more, aside from having my daughter, almost every single decision has made my journey more and more difficult, and taken me further from where I want to be. I feel like a refugee in my own life.

In the analogy of life being a journey, there is no going back and making course corrections. I can't go back to the intersection of Work and College and make a different choice despite the circumstances, I can only try to keep going towards my destination and hope to find that intersection again. You can only move forward, there is no going back, so it's easy to just get completely and utterly lost. 

Now, as I've said, I know I'm here because of my own poor decisions, but is it fair that I be stuck here indefinitely? I don't have people I can ask for help. I don't have resources to pay somebody to care about my well-being.

I am in the middle of a place I don't want to be, scared to death, and have no idea how I'm going to get out of here.",5
"My depression has been up and down over the past 2 years. I've hit my lowest lows, but bounced back towards the highest highs. Recently it seems like I'm slowly going back down, and there's no incline in sight. If everything keeps going the way it is, I'll be farther down than I've ever been. When I was at my lowest, I was pretty ready to take my life. I felt almost a sensation of peace over myself knowing that soon enough I'll never have to feel this way again. I ended up not going through with it, and I talked myself away from those feelings for a good while, and I was feeling good. 

Now I have a kid on the way, almost halfway to the due date, and I'm going back down in the rut. It makes me feel like a complete piece of shit, but knowing that I can't just end it anymore is making it harder to deal with. In the past I've always had suicide as a plan if all else failed, and it made me feel a bit better knowing, if anything, it could all end. But with a kid on the way, I don't dare even think about it. I wouldn't want to have her resent me, or feel guilty in anyway, and now I can't seem to get over this feeling. 

On top of it all, my wife knows of my depression, but overall it feels like it's just a burden to her. I don't even want to talk to her about it anymore because it makes me feel like I'm just complaining and loathing in my own self pity. I'm just stuck where I am, and I hate it more than anything. 

As is, I don't have insurance, or really any money, so I can't seek out medical help. The only other people who I know that have depression is my mom and a friend. But my friend just makes jokes about it, and I have too high of anxiety to talk to my mom about it.

I guess this wasn't really going anywhere, but I needed to get it off of my chest, so thanks.",4
"The past two years have taught me never to hope. Hope is a very big mistake to be making. Every single time I have hoped for the best, or looked forward to the future, it has been taken away without any real reasons and denied. This is not me. I used to love waking up in the morning and I used to love going to school, going home, going to bed. I loved EVERYTHING because I was looking forward to everything. Now what? Days are a fucking blur and all I'm thinking about is the next time I'll be suffering, whether it be dealing with terrible bosses at an underpaid, over stressful job, dealing with angry people, or worrying about not doing the shit I should be. I used to be on top of my shit, and now I feel like I am helplessly behind. I want to hope, but I will hate to see myself be wrong again. I want to hope this year will be better, but I remember making that same promise last year for 2016. It was not better, just same shit different year. I don't really want to hate my life, but I can't help it.  I don't think I'll be able to save myself, but I don't know who even could. Thanks for reading my thoughts, just looking for opinions about this, or even confirmations of someone reading it. ",2
"Hi , I've struggled most all of my life with terrible depression ,anxiety, low self-esteem, suicidal thoughts. Ive reached my 30s now and some life events have led me deeper into depression. I kind of kept hope that my mental problems would be easier to manage/improve over time, but it's not anything like that. I don't know what to tell myself to find hope to keep living, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you ",5
"I wonder what it's like to have healthy relationships and a good self image. It really sounds nice, but I'm stuck in this hellhole called depression (and anxiety).",4
"Well today I went to work at 6 am, and from then until around 10 am I was in the worst mood I had in a long time; I felt like I wanted to die so badly just to stop all the problems I have. Several times I had to go to the bathroom just to silently cry my eyes out for 5-15 minutes.
So my mom and step dad pick me up and take me to lunch, things are okay, I'm calm and...
They tell me that they've somehow been spying on when I'm clocking in and out and they want me to clock out when they want to not when the managers want me to. That's how they are-I can't do things my way cause I'm an immature autistic 23 year old who's only staying with them because they offered me a place to stay while I build up money and looked for housing. I've been pressured to take a 2nd job in October because they hated how I don't get 40-60 hours a week at least; they don't want me going to therapy unless it's immediately after a work day so my therapy doesn't conflict with their âvaluable timeâ, and I get praised for doing things their way but scolded for doing things my way. Nothing I do pleases them in the long run; in fact I don't even have the choice to go to the ER to get evaluated (because I've had suicidal like thoughts all day) or even quit one of my jobs.
So yes, 2018 has begun and I already wish I was dead",3
"So yesterday, I asked all of my friends if they had plans for the New Years Eve as I had nothing to do. They all told me that they were not going to do anything and just gonna chill out with their family. So I thought, alright since all my friends aren't going out then I might as well just stay home with my family too. Shortly after the midnight countdown, I checked my snapchat, and what did I see? All my friends were partying it up and having fun without me! I was so fucking pissed off and sad. This wasn't the first time they did this and this was the last fucking straw, I am never gonna talk to them ever again. But now I have no friends at all, how can one recover from this and make new friends? I need some advice please.",4
"I think the relationship btw money and ur mental health is just direct! If i have so much money i guess i wouldn't be so damn miserable!

I guess peope are right, if u ain't making money u ain't living!
I am just so jealous of rich people that how much they can do and enjoy their life with.

Let's just all admit that happiness is really purely depend on how much freaking money you have, we need to stop telling people or ourselves that money isn't everything, this kind of denial mentality is so toxic!

The more and sooner we realize it's the fact the sooner we will be able to end our lives. Don't u agree with me?
It will never be better, it's just not! It's been so many years, things won't get better, period! We need to face it! I just don't have the balls to end it right now but it is the only way to get out- DEATH. 

I hope we all eventually have the guts to do it, new year's wish-I just hope I can die this year, let me outttt! I can't stand not one second! I need to die soon! I need to jump to the rail or something!

"Just another New Year post to add to the mix.

Spending it alone. I know there are parties around where I would be welcome, but I'm tired. I can't deal with wearing a happy mask today. So much bad stuff has been dropped on me in the past week or two that I just can't.

And here comes the New Year. I know it's just another day. An arbitrary start and stop point. But I still cant help but think about how it's a bad omen and since I'm starting it bad it's just going to be a bad year. Optimists might say ""hey, it can only get better from here."" Never seems that way to me. There is no ""rock bottom,"" just more falling.

I'm tired.",5
"Backstory: I'm 21. My dad just turned 73. I have the typical father / daughter relationship every girl wishes to have. I was spoiled growing up. Yes, he's old. Yes, I was an accident. Yes, my parents are still together. Let's continue. 

Last year was big for me. Was promoted as the youngest employee company wide to have my position. I moved out. Travelled a LOT. Last year I also learned my dad's cancer had spread and it was a lot more serious this time. I was on my own, living my own life, for 6 months. I realized how bad things had gotten, and I broke my lease and moved back home to help assist my parents with things around the house. In May, he stopped treatment. He was given 6-9 months. We are now at the 9 month mark and he's on his way to a hospital bed in our living room. Meanwhile, my mom is a chainsmoker who is  coming down with pneumonia. 

Back to the point. My father is old, and has lived a very good life. I cannot be angry that his time has come. What I am angry about, however, is the fact I am now lost. Here comes my thought process.

Watching my mother take care of my dad in ways I would have never thought possible, how will she handle this when her husband is no longer on this earth?

He will without a doubt pass in my childhood home. When is the appropriate time to move out again? Will my mom be okay to take care of herself? 

I'm taking a lot of time off of work, and my boss is okay with it under the given circumstances. What if I'm not ready to return?

My mom lost her mother during the summer of 2015. Now she's losing her husband Spring of 2017, if he makes it that far. As far as family goes, it's just me and my brother, who has a family of his own. 

She's the type of mom who will spend hundreds of dollars on presents if it means not having to keep in touch daily / be a babysitter etc.. Not because she dislikes us, but because she has always been an independent, introverted.. er, bitch. When she does connect with you, it is something to be adored. She has a very unique way of showing love and it's the only love I have ever known from her. 

I keep having to remind myself that I am 21 and have my whole life ahead of me, but is that selfish? I'm not looking to abandon her after this is all said and done, but I ~feel~ like I need to return to my life as soon as possible. It's taking a toll on me mentally, and as a result, I'm isolating myself from friends and social gatherings. I just have no desire to do those things anymore. Some days its hard to get out of bed because I can't do anything. It's not that I don't WANT to get up start my day, I just lay there and think, ""whats the point? I don't need plans."" That's new. My parents are in the other room together 90% of the time, while I spend my entire day in my room trying to find things to distract me from my current life. I don't like thinking about the future because I feel exhausted trying to make those thoughts seem realistic. I'm either very irritable or so quiet that I don't think I can talk. The thought of going back to work to make money to resume the life I had seems unpalatable. 

I guess what I'm saying is, I'm stuck in a very large rut and I don't know what direction to go in, I just know that I need to get out of it.

TLDR: My dad is dying of natural causes, I put my life on pause to spend time with him, I realized that my mom might not do too well alone, and I don't know how / when / if I will go back to my life before I moved home or how I want to resume my life to move on.",4
"2017 has been such a shitty year for me and i hope 2018 treats me well. i'm so tired of being depressed all the time but i can't help how i feel and it's such a pain to see it affect my everyday lives. i've grown distant with my friends and i'm going to try to not do that anymore because i value them so so much. i'm going to do my best to change for the better because my personality is just...pushing people away from my life and it's sad to notice it.

here's to 2018. i hope you all have a wonderful new year's. ",4
"I might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out. 

Most of the time I start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends (as if) and an interesting life, like in a cartoon adventure or something. Sometimes I even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that could've happened. 

It's starting to become more and more frequent and I'm finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head. Then reality comes crashing down and it feels horrible when I realize my crazy fantasies will never happen. 

It's just so much better in my mind. Anyone else?",1
"She was abusive, and a huge contributor to my worsening depression. But for some reason I stayed with her for 5 years because she was my first.

I go to bed and I can't sleep because I am just always thinking about all the bad stuff she has done to me. She didn't let me have friends, she didn't let me socialize, she GPS tracked my location and I was convinced even by her family that It was normal. I couldn't go to a fast food restaurant without her screaming over the phone telling me I'm out with a friend or I'm cheating.

She changed my life for the better tho...she made me fight to better myself and my future. I wanted to start a family with her and have a home one day and give my kids a better future.

All my dreams gone....I am lifeless....",4
"In other words, just another New Years Eve. ",5
"Always when laying awake late at night. Moments of existential nihilism and realism. Realizing how shitty the whole concept of life is. And just any kind of realistic negatively in general. Usually about my personal life, and how much of a failure I am. ",5
"Every day just feels the same, get up, go to school or go to work, get home, go to sleep, wash rinse repeat. Im feeling drained, depressed, and overwhelmingly bored. I have a few hobbies and a few friends, but the only thing that brings me comfort is sleep. I know i've probably experienced only a portion of what this life has to offer, but the rest will probably disappoint me anyway.",5
"I am making this post mostly because for the 1st time ever somebody has called the police on me reporting that I was suicidal.

I often times hit a point to where I am broke every month and I talk about wishing I could just leave earth painlessly and times where I just randomly break down because I am sick of having almost no human interaction and at the age of 30 I haven't even had so much as a girlfriend. So I am constantly questioning my worth and life based on that alone.

But the cops came by my house just a couple of minutes ago and asked if I felt suicidal, and I told them no, because honestly right now I feel ""fine"". Fine in the sense that I feel I can function normally and at least for the rest of the day and probably just stay in my room and read or play random computer games.

So I ask, am I even considered suicidal? While I do constantly think about what would be the repercussions of killing myself(My family kind of depends on me financially atm) I have never actually made the attempt to kill myself(Honestly just too scared I think). I'm really just curious on if I am considered suicidal or if I just need to find out how to not be a piece of shit at life.",5
"when I first started really struggling with depression I had a lot of people tell me that it gets better or things will change, yadda yadda whatever. Well I've made some great friends, found success with women, got two well paying internships, and I still want to fucking die. Its all bullshit. What do you do after 7 years of trying to make it better? I started working out, stopped smoking, got help with ADD. none of it has helped. I thought bettering yourself was suppsoed to help? All I can think about every day is when I am going to kill myself. All i want to do is go to sleep and never wake up. To be honest im surprised Ive made it this far. The truth is I am fucking terrified and Im not sure what to do.",5

"I've got an obsession with time, so much so I think I'm losing my mind. I don't really know if it's because I'm depressed or not, but just today I quit my job because wasting away for a full 8 hours a day feels like I'm being enslaved by corporate juggernauts.   

Monday through Friday it's Wake up, bathe, dress, eat. Drive an hour in backed up traffic to get to the job responsible for this life sucking routine...Shit, I'm 10 minutes late. Boss is gonna threaten my lively hood for such a simple mistake.    

""Stop crying, at least you get paid. You should be grateful for those hours and all that money you made"".  

Yeah that's what my parents say. I can understand the reason but I just don't see it that way. Dress the part, smile and Kiss ass at a job that you hate in hopes for a promotion, 4 years go by and that door still hasn't opened. I hate it. I'm looking at the clock and its 2:28 AM, I've been up all night drinking and thinking about the day life ends. Hopefully soon.    

I'm only 25 yet It feels like I've reached the end of the line. Life is just a constant struggle of standing in line and trying to survive. No girlfriend, kids, friends, a broken family. It's just me, myself and I and Mrs. Brandy. I've contributed nothing to society and why should I? Society has given me nothing but pain and disdain for everything around me.    

Some stupid motherfucker gets in front of a camera and shows the world how stupid they are for 5 minutes. Now all of a sudden they have millions and have the fucking balls to say that they started a business!? Yeah society loves that shit. Hitting subscribe, follow, retweet, Keep feeding and endorsing it. I went to school, college, got a job and in the end I'm just another nobody with nothing to show for it. That shit gets to me.  

I feel uneasy posting this, not out of fear. I just don't usually share my problems, because hell nobody cares. Don't try and tell me things will get better, I'm past that. I've accepted the fact that most of us are destined to be trapped like rats in a maze for some sort of sick experiment. No matter what route you take there is no exit....except one. I've taken way too long to type this shit. It's 3:30am and I got work at...nevermind I forgot. Guess I'll just go to sleep.

"Hey guys! I'm new here, and I have been hesitant to speak on this. My depression started around 3 years ago during my sophomore year in high school, and I've tried to suppress it as much as possible, but unfortunately it still plagues me in small instances while being in my second semester of college. One of them that I can't seem to shake, is not being interested in literally anything. I used to love video games, now I can't play one for 5 minutes without getting bored or annoyed. I used to love skateboarding, and now I can't stand to go out and do it. Can anyone give me tips or solutions? ",4

SOOO FUCKING EMBARRASSING btw. Prior to this moment I fantasized about dying a hand full of times this year, it just hasn't been the best year for me with a lot more terrible lows than ups, but at that moment when i realized that my life is so precious and delicate and at any moment it can all be gone forever without showing any warning. I now understand that the possibility of taking my own life would be the most brainless decision I could ever make and I am thankful that I didn't no matter how bad shit may be in my life. I know shit can be tough and I know that the pain hurts but nothing can hurt as bad as being gone forever. Today was probably the best day of my year because I didn't die by death from chicken and waffle. I don't want to push my ideas on anyone or anything but I hope this can help someone out.

"You promised to never leave me, literally a day before you left. You promised me you loved me no matter how much I bugged you and asked you over and over if you really did. You wanted to spend Christmas with me, yet a day later you left me. 

You promised you'd stay. You were mine and I was yours. You were always my one to talk to, my only one to talk to. The only one I could be myself around, the only one I've ever loved. For once in my life I didn't feel this horrible feeling I never wanted to come back.

I'm nothing but a distant bad memory to you, and the most you wanted from me in the end was pleasure. How fucking dare you. We haven't talked in 3 days, It's killing me inside. The most we have ever not talked in over a year.

As many letters or messages I write to you, to Reddit, or to even myself you will never want me. I will always want you, desperate for even just a message from you. I want you to miss me and love me again. It's all I will ever want.

You wanted me for so long, you fought for us, you wanted me. I'm guessing it's my fault. I wore you down, I'm so so sorry. I'm sorry to myself for making us end up like this. I love you so fucking much. You took money from me, oh well right? Too bad that money was worth more than I ever was. I will forever regret trusting you, maybe we would still be together.

I want the pain to stop. I want you to get out of my mind. I want you so badly and it's eating away at me. I will never get better. I never want another guy to love me or to care about me just to leave me like that. I never want to get hurt again like this.
I lost the only person who made me happy. I fucking hate myself, but I guess that's what you wanted. We both made mistakes but I am always the one to blame.

Please miss me.

I was broken before and now I'm shattered. 

I will never trust or love again. No one will ever get to make me feel this way again.

I love you, A. More than you could imagine.",4
"Over the past year I've lost the majority of my friends. It started off with a health issue that I obviously couldn't prevent, which somehow made me lose most of my friends in high school. I then thought I was alright as I still had a couple of very close friends. I was outgoing, and some other people still seemed to like me. But almost immediately after graduation everyone stopped talking to me. And now in college I still feel so upset and bitter about my high school experience that I don't know how to open up to new people. I'm quiet, introverted, and can't connect with the people I meet. I've met a ton of seemingly great people that right after meeting me escaped becoming my friend. So now I'm lonely in college, my depression is creeping back up after years of carefree happiness, and I've taken to the Internet and video games as my safe place. It's a life that's depressing, but I hope that one day I'll stop feeling so numb and alone. 

One of my closest friends recently just stopped talking to me. We used to play xbox all the time together. Now she hardly answers my texts, giving the simple ""busy"" excuse. I've spent too much time trying to be supportive and loving when other people won't give me a minute of their own time. This is only one example of why I've become only a ghost of my typical self.

I guess, has anyone ever dealt with this? Are you dealing with this now? These types of things only seem to happen to people with depression and other mental illness, which is one of the cruelest things imo.

"hey guys, this is something that i dont really do. Usually i use reddit for giggle and shits but now that im so depressed and desperate and i have no one to talk to i come here hoping i can pour my heart out before it pours blood out from sharp objects.

there's this girl, my best friend. Known her for like 3 years and i never thought i could love her so much, for in the past i saw her as annoying and stubborn and whiny but as time goes by i couldnt help but fell madly in love with her (without her knowing). I did make a move last summer but she straight out rejected me. We had a big fight and didnt talk to each other for like 2 months, worst 2 months of 2017, wanting to kill myself all the time and constantly being cynical to everybody. 

But we bumped into each other again at the end of November i think and she cried a lot and she hugged me saying she missed me so much and it was like, the warmest hug i've ever had in my entire life and at that moment i realized i dont want to lose her again, it kills me without her, inside and outside. 

But it's happening again, one night when a friend asked me how i was doing (he knew about my feelings for her) so i told him i still had the same feelings and he said that i should give up because she made it clear to him that she didnt want to take a step further with me. So i was very upset that night and i told him i couldnt because i was in too deep and i couldnt back out and nobody could help me back out and that he shouldnt care, nobody should care because i was dead, i was dead from inside to outside and nobody could help me. Only i could help me but i didnt want to. 

So my friend, i dont know what the fuck he has been thinking, thought it would be somehow of a solution to just tell her how am i feeling and you know what, she got all cold and wouldnt talk to me for weeks. I knew what was wrong but i pretended i didnt know anything. I dont want anything to mess with my head rn because im having an exam in a couple days. But i cant stand the harsh and dry tone when i wish her a nice christmas and new year and thank her for her christmas gift, i tried to ignore it and played it cool but deep down i just want to fucking kill myself to see if she cared. 

she said that we need to talk after my exam and i fear that i might get rejected again and it could also seriously damage our friendship too and i fear that we might break it. I dont want to loss her, she's the reason why i stopped thinking about killing myself buf i cant stand just being her friend. I sometimes think am i those cringy love desperate ""nice guy"" neckbeard who hates women because they reject them on the internet but i think im different. I've known this girl for 4 years now and i cant help but love her for who she is, not just some random hottie to DM on the internet. 

you guys can call me a wimp for whining over a subject that people constantly laugh at (the friendzone), i dont care, i just want to write something down to empty my thoughts for a while because the one person whom i always talk to when i have problems is now cold to me. Pls dont say there are other girls or there are many fishes or stuff like that, im told that and i also tell ppl that a lot and im sick of it. It's like when you're dying sick and the doctor tell you not to die and you can miraculously live. I spend too many brain cells picturing the hanging noose and pills and the razor and i smoked a lot (started smoking when she rejected me for the first time) and my chest hurt and i couldnt sleep well at night and i cant smile anymore.

"I had a failed suicide attempt on Christmas, and since then, I've been âgladâ to be alive but so violently depressed
My birthday, the 26th, was spent working and alone. Nobody remembered it, as always. My New Years is also going to be spent alone. I'm out of my anxiety meds, and have to wait until January to get more. I want to cry all the time. Even trying to get myself to wash my hair is hard. I can't even do that most of the time. I can only sit here wishing I was crying, but nothing is coming out. It's just tough right now guys. I haven't had interaction with anyone other than coworkers, and my parents for weeks. My mother, who I take care of, doesn't believe depression is even crippling. She takes it as a stunned toe, âjust walk it offâ. I'm ready to feel normal again. I'm tired of wanting any kind of attention just to feel loved for even a split second. I feel so absolutely useless in this world, but I'm too exhausted to want to kill myself again. It's more of a âI'm glad to be alive I guess but if something killed me right now I would be okayâ  My life is a mess

That sad part is that things could be worse and probably will be in 2018. Happy New Years everyone! Best of luck to everyone that's trapped in their own mind.,5
I just need a little advice on dealing with this transition into single life,0
2016 wasn't one of my best years rather it was one of my worsts. I feel like shit and I have a splitting headache. Good way to start off the new year I guess lol let's just see how this year goes. Hopefully better than the last,0

"So I've got this friend that I talk to about everything. He knows more about me than probably any person on this earth. And he's super suicidal lately. 

I called 911 on him a few days ago for what could have been a suicide attempt. He was alright but idk. 

It's just scary man, like not knowing if he's gonna be there the next morning you know? 

And I just got hit with this realization last night that there's literally nothing I can do. I can be supportive but aside from that, I can't say or do anything to change his mind. And I mean it's stressing me out mate. 

Anyways idk why I'm saying this or what I hope to achieve by it. But yeah. Thanks guys. ",4
man i fucking hate talking to people because i just feel disgusted with myself for being a waste of space and not being able to hold a conversation i hate having friends / knowing people because they give me so much anxiety and worry that theyre all gonna gang up on me and make my life miserable,1
"I feel as if depression has turned me into some sort of subhuman creature. Every time I talk to one of my friends, they tell me about their days stuffed full of classes and going out and traveling and somehow still fitting in basic care of themselves and their homes. They talk about living their best lives, and how they are in their prime. I feel like I am talking to a completely different species. 

It takes an incredible amount of mental willpower to get myself out of bed in the morning and feed myself. I can't fathom having the energy to work, go to school, take care of myself, dedicate time to friends, hygiene, cooking, cleaning, planning, and more all in one day, every day. But everyone I know around me my age seems to be managing such a busy, full life.

I feel like a devolved form of them, only having the mental and physical capacity to handle a small fraction of what others continually accomplish daily. Just wondering if anyone else feels no longer human as well.",2
"It's kind of hard to describe. But every once in a while, it hits me harder than usual, where I'm just laying in bed all day, and everything of who I am Is gone. But I can vividly feel my 8 year-old self laying in bed with the exact same feeling, and my 11 year-old self and so on.
It's like a unified depression of all of pasts and futures combined. Like I somehow merge into one single being. And it's just a feeling of utter hopelessness. A feeling that everything is changing for the worse. The good things are all gone. All the people I loved are no longer the same people, or have just simply left my life forever. I see people like my parents and family ageing. People are getting married and having kids. Those kids are getting older. 
I feel like I want to die, and rid myself of this misery that I've experienced my entire life. And I've had a pretty good life, I really can't complain about anything. Other people have it a lot worse. 

I'm only 22, but I feel like I've somehow lived a hundred lifetimes. I used to be religious. Or at least I was forced to be religious. But I realize that even if God and heaven existed, I don't want to go to heaven. I'm only 22 and I already feel like I should be packing her in. Like I've lived long enough, and am exhausted. I certainly don't want to live for an infinite amount of time. It would be hell. 
Everything in the world just feels so heavy.

"this is something i've never been able to tell anyone because i feel like they'd think i was a bad person. that they would think i'm a selfish, self-pitying person. and, to be honest, i feel that i am.

i see things like 'how to get motivated to ____' and i think, i dont want to be motivated. i dont *want* to get over this, i just want to be alone and pretend that i dont exist.

i think it has to do with being comfortable with being depressed. i've always been consistently sad, and i feel that its a part of me now. i don't know what i'd be if i wasn't depressed. ",0
"I hit up a friend i haven't talked to for a year due to my depression and he just ignored me. Less than a month ago we ran into each other and he told me to message him. 

I don't expect people to wait for me with opened arms. I hate being given false hope and false sense of some happiness. Now i am filled with guilt and stuck feeling like crap. I deserve to be alone.",5
"I have only been taking them for a few weeks. I have the same thoughts I had before that used to make me super sad and anxious, but now it's like I'm neutral about it. For example, jumping to conclusions about someone not wanting to be my friend for some stupid reason. Well now, I still think ""they must not want to be my friend"" but instead of going home and crying about it I just kind of shrug it off.


Is this typical of anyone else's experience?",4
"This year has been complete hell for me I turned 22

I lost my girlfriend of 4 years she broke up with me by handing me the custom necklace I got her..

I fell thousands of dollars in debt from helping her with everything she needed from phones to car payments.

I met my best friend fell completely in love with her thought she felt the same way so I asked her out she turned me down. everything was fine (I just loved her company) until 2 weeks ago she started dating and I never really see her anymore and is now about to move away.... 

I'm stuck living with my parents who tell me how everything I do is wrong how I should have a 50k+ income how I should have moved out 2 years ago becomes it's easy to afford to live. I can't afford to move out alone I truly thought she loved me and we were simply going to get a apartment we even talked about it a lot to the point we looked at some..

I'm ending 2016 thousands in debt alone and depressed knowing there will never be anyone there for me when I need them my few friends I consider family and I would do anything for them (from buying tires to food to giving them a ride) and I like to think that they would be there for me... but this year has shown me that's not the case that non of them truly care about me...

I've been sleeping all day after work crying slowly realizing I have no one even as I write this I'm realizing that.

"Depression functions in a way where our percieved ""rock bottom"" always happened somewhere in the past month. The truth is, depression gets worse overtime. That rock bottom that people claim to hit is just an illusion. You are depressed for ten months, feel like you are over it for one month, then sink. You keep sinking farther down into the earth until you reach fucking hell. You keep getting lonelier until  you start getting confused whether you're saying stuff in your head or out loud. You grow to be more disgusted by yourself. Your ugly face, your ugly mind, all your fucking failures, and your stupid fucking ego. You feel more and more guilty, regretting every fucking desicion that you make that makes you the stupid failure that you are. You start to cry so much that you can't cry anymore. Soon people don't help your loneliness, compliments don't cure your disgust for yourself, and success doesn't cure your guilt. And the funny thing is, even that isn't rock bottom.

Fuck all of those stupid idiots who say it will get better, it only proves how fucking unaware they are to the logical decline that is the essence of depression.",5
"I am sorry for the rant, I just feel the need to get this out. 

Today I had to stay home from work because I am too stressed and sad. Last night I had a mini meltdown and tried to just leave and go to a hotel , but my husband was able to talk me out of it. I didn't have a plan, I just wanted to get away from everything and have one night away from it all.  I have trouble sleeping at night because work stresses me out so much. I applied for other jobs and already got those rejection letters in the mail which only made me feel even worse.  I feel trapped in a job and a life that I hate. I just can't seem to get happy. I have an amazing husband, a good family,  a decent paying job, I see a therapist, but nothing seems to work or make me happy. I feel like a passenger in my own life. Like an extra in a movie. Sometimes I feel like it wouldn't't even matter if I were gone because I don't even feel like I am here anyway. I feel so detached.  I know I am depressed, and I am trying, but feel like I am being beaten down to the point where I just don't want to try anymore.  I'm tired. I am so tired of trying only to fail.",2

I'm tired of being bullied on a daily basis by the people who should make me feel safe.

As I write this my mom is laughing in the kitchen because my brother said something that made me cry. Making me cry seems to be their favorite game. 

Going out makes me anxious and being at home is driving me nuts.

"If I wanted to describe my life in one word it would be ""confused"".  Nothing in my life makes sense, i've been searching for somewhere to belong and can't find it. I'm lost.
-Culturally I don't feel like I have any sense of national identity. I'm British but I don't feel tied to that culture or any other.
- Ethnically i'm mostly white, however slightly not ,so i've never felt at home in white society. I also notice many things about white society that are problematic.
- Sexually i'd say i'm mostly straight. I've only ever been in love with women and sexually am only interested in women for the most part. However, I do sometimes feel affection and aesthetic attraction for some men, sort of like a crush but not sexual? This is another reason why i'm lost.
- I don't like or relate to any of my family.
- I don't feel tied to religion or atheism.
- I've never been in love and can't seem to build connections with anyone.

I feel so lost. I don't feel like I have an identity. I don't belong. I've always been depressed but I have no idea why. How can I find answers?

I would go to lengths that would have serious effects on my life just to help this person.

To cut a long story short, I've had this crush on a girl for well over a year now. Not a day goes by when I don't think about her and checking her social media accounts has became part of my daily routine. She lives overseas and there is a significant age difference, I'm 15 and she's 20. 


For a few hours after I wake up, she's all I think about and it causes a nauseating feeling in my stomach. (Also, has anyone else been through this or know what it is?)

Unlike most crushes, I recognise her flaws. She's passive aggressive, a humble bragger, a control freak, a spoilt girl who grew up in a mansion. But she's not an awful person, far from. I relate to her in so many ways. That's how I can see through her little act. She's insecure about her appearance and how people perceive her and has admitted to being depressed in the past. 


I only know her through her social media presence. But I'm certain I would make her so happy if I were her boyfriend. I'd take care of her, let her cry in my arms and vent about her problems all night. I'd take care of her.


I suppose some things aren't meant to be, we live in different countries, we're different ages and she doesn't even fucking know me. Despite this, I can't just get over her and move on. I can't even distract myself, all I think about is her. Like I've said, I've been this way for years. Is this fate trying to tell me there is a chance or just my depression trying to beat me down and get me to get my hopes up?


Anyone been through anything like this or know how to move forward? Also, sorry about the cringe-worthy ""I'd be good the best boyfriend"" speech I typed out earlier. I know it's so clichÃ©, but I think it needed to be said. 


Oh, and happy New Years!",4

"Hello everyone,

I'm a long time lurker on this sub. Like I mentioned in the title, my life has been nothing but a mess for the last 4 years. I failed university in my last semester and never managed to finish my degree in 2013 and the entire 2014. I started working in 2015 but by early 2016 I self-sabotaged myself out of a stable job due to depression from a break up with my then girlfriend of 5 years. 

I have been living like a parasite for the last 2 years - living with my parents without paying anything. My self-esteem at the moment is so low I was about to delete this very post just because I felt bad typing all of that out.

Nights after nights I go to sleep asking myself - what do I even live for? Helpless, frustrating, disappointing, sad, angry and sometimes suicidal are probably what you'd use to describe my inner thought in recent years. 

I don't know if any of you experience this but in my mind there's this voice that constantly talks down to me. ""You're a useless piece of shit"" is probably the number one thing that it keep reminding me. I never tell my parents that I'm depressed. Or that I failed uni. Or that I had a girlfriend and broke up with her after 5 years. I lied to them when they tried to talk to me about those things. I just couldn't help it. At this point that voice in my head is probably my only friend.

I don't even know if anyone cares at this point. I'm just rambling and writing random things that probably don't make any sense. But I want to get it out somehow. I decided to not delete this post after all. 

So yeah, just want to talk about my random miserable life on the Internet with strangers for god know why. If you guys have any thing to share about your life as well I will be here reading. Probably.

There's really no chance of my romantic situation ever changing though... So I'm back to sitting alone with no hope, just me and my shitty brain I don't even want.  I don't know why my depression is so bad today, not sure if it's the new year and the prospect of going around again with the same old bullshit of being rejected or the amount of happy couples I saw today.  That always gets me... Seeing people happy, just wishing you could feel things like love, affection, closeness with someone...but knowing that's the one part of life you are permanently gated from.  All I want to do is die but I can't so I guess lifetime of misery it is..",4
"Just down right now and allowing my mind to wander off. Is there really a point to life? Speaking from a non-religious standpoint, what is the point?

"I know this sort of post isn't original or whatever but here it is. 

It's New Years Eve today where I am and honestly... I don't think I could care any less. 

I'm so tired of pretending to give a shit about everything. About people about things about university and assignments. Mostly I'm tired of other people pretending to give a shit about me because they don't. That's it. They don't. 

My family say they care yet constantly bombard me with all of their problems expecting me to have a magical solution. My friends are going through their own shit and whilst they try there's nothing they can do for me. My girlfriend well... that's something else entirely. I know she's not happy. I know she'd rather not be with me. She's been down this road before got the T shirt she shouldn't have to deal with my bs too. I love her so much I don't want to put her through this. 

But the issue is I can't ever see myself getting better. It feels impossible. All I want to do everyday is stay in bed. I want to sleep all of the time. Half the time I'm not even physically tired I just... everything is too much effort. I can't win. I really can't. I've been trying for years but it never gets better. Not for people like me. We're destined to suffer and bleed and cry forever. What sort of life is that?

I don't think I want to see the New Year. I just want to end it all. ",2
I have major depressive disorder. I'm going through an episode. But this time I seem to be getting really mad at my boyfriend for seemingly no reason... he hasn't done anything wrong I've just been so frustrated with his existence lately but I don't want to be without him... this scares me and I want to stop feeling angry at him and go back to feeling nothing but love for him. Help?,4
Hello. I am feeling sad because I can't stop worrying about everything. Dying alone. Running out of money. My health. My loneliness. My car. My family. Retirement for goodness sake. I'm 27. And it's making me miserable. I can't stop worrying about everything. ,2
I genuinely don't know what to do. I get excited every time I get a notification. I'm tempted just to go put gas in my car and drive around so I don't have to think about how little people want me around ,5
"I know I've probably said this countless times before, but fuck, when I think about the way that I act and speak I just get filled with this hatred and hopelessness. I can't stand myself, I don't know why I'm like this but I'm a god awful person to be around. 

I can't keep up a conversation to save my life, it seems like no matter what I'm just repulsive in every way. Nobody wants to talk to me for more than a few minutes, the amount of times I've been left ""on read"" as the cool kids say, is too many to count. I don't know what I'm doing wrong but at the same time I'm painfully aware of how awkward, unfunny, negative and all around incomprehensible I am. I can barely string together a coherent sentence.

It's like every time I try to talk to someone my mind just blanks and I don't know how to reply, no matter how much time I spend forming my response it's always hard to read trash. I can't do anything right, I'm mean, sarcastic, unfunny, awkward and just plain stupid with an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the worst time. 

I'm just so hopeless, I'm so tired of being me and living with this irredeemable trash pile for a brain. It feels like there's nothing I can do to change or improve, no matter what I'll always be this rude sack of shit that's hated almost universally by everyone around them. I wish I had the balls to end it all and save the world from having to deal with me, I'm so damn selfish for keeping myself alive like this. ",5

My life has been constant ups and downs, from abusive parents and partners, to self sabotage and circumstances out of my control that almost ruined my life... 

When am I going to stop being punished....? I'm a good person.. I try to be... why do I keep getting handed sour lemons when I try so hard to be happy and make good lemonade? ",1
I stopped when I got pregnant but I had to weigh the risks. I haven't been myself in months. I'm miss having hobbies. I miss enjoying my old hobbies. Nothing appeals to me anymore. Nothing brings me joy. And I'm tired of feeling this way.,3
"I'm sorry if this post ends up being long, I'll try to keep it short but please read to the end if you can. Basic background information: 20 almost 21-year-old male, I'm currently studying computer science (in my 3rd year in college). I actually took the 2017 fall semester off because of how uncertain I felt about actually studying computer science and I just felt terrible in general due to anxiety/depression. During my time off I worked to save up some money and sought help for my issues. Been going to therapy and got meds for anxiety but nothing for depression. Everything was going relatively well/getting better until I had to go back to school. My thoughts of self-doubt began to creep back in and everything just feels joyless. This always seems to happen when I feel stressed about change or literally anything else. I've lost a lot of interest in things I usually enjoy and just feel down. I feel like a failure because I'm thinking about changing my major with a year left. It'll most certainly add an extra year to my college career (I understand that this is actually somewhat common but it still makes me feel bad). To make it even worse, while I'm feeling uncertain of what to study, I genuinely have no idea what I'd study instead cause I'm so damn indecisive. I don't know where else to turn. Computer science seems cool to me but the work seems so joyless because most positions are desk jobs from what I can tell which makes me feel depressed knowing that's what's waiting for me when I graduate. I've spoken to guidance counselors, visited a few places to do job shadows, and done countless hours of career research and I'm just feeling so done with all of it. Can anyone offer any suggestions to me or has anyone ever been in a similar situation? I can give you more information if you choose to reply and need more insight. I'm just tired of feeling this way. I want to find my true passion and stop feeling like shit all the time.",2

I just wish I wasn't so I could end it but no I'm a pussy so that's not going to happen. I'm just at a point where I can't be fucked and I guess this is how it'll be.

"Man lets see some of my highlights: 

-Started the year of doing lines of yack and smoking weed with people I thought would be my life long friends and overall brothers after all we had done and shared together.

-Met a beautiful girl online who I fell in love with. She was a first for me. Had a great amazing relationship at first but eventually our differences became too great and my depression mixed with her whole nonesense and bs kinda led to our on and off thing and us ultimately breaking up in september for good. I was devastated and depressed as fuck for a long time. For some reason checked her ig a while back and saw she moved on fairly quick and she's happier which kind of kills me inside a bit but overall at this point I'm happy for her and hope she finds what she's looking for.

-Almost didn't graduate cause I was too caught up in slacking off doing drugs and bumming out with ""friends"". But after a shit ton of detention (a grand total of 149 hours lol) I managed to get my shit together. My teacher Mrs. Nelson cried because of my actions and ultimately made me take school more seriously at the end and may just be the reason I graduated, Thank you Mrs. Nelson and I'm sorry i let my issues prevent us from having a really good relationship.

-Got sued cause of a stupid accident by a scam artist, but my insurance company handled it so I guess it wasn't to bad just really stressful.

-Tried killing myself a few times. One time I emptied a tank of gas on myself and almost lit myself on fire but the cops came and I was taken away to a psych ward. Met some crazy motherfuckers there but learned alot about myself. Once I got out of that place I needed a job after quiting my last one so I started pushing. That lasted a short while before I got my act together.

-Started college and went for a month before dropping out. 

-Got arrested after my dad called the cops on me after I hit a wall with some plyers lol. He stretched the truth a shit ton Got charged with felonies and now I'm facing jail time. Been going to anger management and rehab and now I'm starting to face and handle issues better than I would in years past. 

-I was homeless for a while. This taught me the importance of money, homes, and life. Being out in 20 degree weather without much to your name can make you want to bust your ass off harder than you ever could have thought imaginable. 

-Tried to jump off a bridge a few weeks after my arrest. Got stopped by the cops. I was drunk and called my friends because Idk i wasn't good mentally. I was tired, sad, depressed and just overall unable to continue with life at the point I was in life. Lost alot if not all of my friends at the time. About 80 percent of them actually. We still say hello and talk from time to time but its not like it used to be. Can't say I blame them. 

Now moving into 2017 I just want to get back to living a life of normal day to day monotony with its perks here and there. I want to get a car and pursue my passion of automotive engineering and working on cars. I don't care about the bullshit as much and I'm just ready to move on. Hopefully I don't spend my bday behind bars. What were your highlights /r/depression? ",3
"Hi guys, long time reader first time poster here.

A year ago I moved into an apartment in a brand new city. I remember being so excited for all the things I'd be able to do. I'd get a job, get to a gym membership, and even join a few social groups.

Well, after a year, nothings really changed. I applied for a lot of jobs and ended up going to a decent number of interviews. Nothing ever came of them and after June passed me by I lost my nerve to even really look anymore.
     I did end up getting a gym membership but I've never really used it though. I know I shouldn't procrastinate like this but I'm never able to find the energy.
     I haven't been able to find any groups or friends while I've been here either. I've looked but the only groups I've been able to find have been smaller groups that cater to people a lot older than I am. 

It's been getting harder and harder to find motivation to get out of bed or go outside for a long time now. As I don't have a car, I'd have to take the bus to go anywhere which would eat up most of my day. I haven't really been able to derive any sense or pleasure from much anything these days. I'm just letting the time pass.

Next week, I'm starting university and I'd like to enjoy this time of my life. But I know that it'll probably end the same as all the years I spent at community college did, with nothing of significance happening and not making any friends.",2
"I've had the ""there's so much for you to live for"" talk too many times. Everyone's advice is all the same. It's all so trivial.

Eat healthy and exercise! I did. I started at 240 lbs. Got down to 180. Then I went on meds and went back to 220. 

Talk to people! I did. Now they don't talk to me or they're weird around me.

Get professional help! I did. They either didn't know what to do or they told me to go talk to someone else in my government's healthcare.

Take time for yourself! Ok I'm staring at a wall and my thoughts are racing now what?

Journal! Tried that, ended up with me just bitching about my problems to myself. Wasn't very helpful

Focus on your hobbies! Hard to do that when nothing interests me anymore.

Make goals and follow through! Ok I did them now what?

Take medication! I did. For almost a year. All it did was either do nothing, give me horrible anxiety in which I couldn't move, or didn't help and just made me gain weight.

Also great to hear that depression never really goes away it just gets easier to manage. What's the point? Living life for the sake of living just seems pointless to me. There are so many people who'll say there's so much to live for or that it gets better. What if it doesn't? I don't really have anything to live for except for my pets who depend on me, but they won't care if I'm gone. It gets better is the biggest lie I've ever heard.",5
"I feel empty inside. Like I float from day to day, moment to moment. I don't really feel anything anymore. Just this emptiness and hollowness in my chest, right on my heart. I feel cold when I look at people, and I feel nothing towards the things that used to bring me such joy. Will this last forever? Because this is not the forever I wish to have. I am numb. I have nothing left. Sometimes I feel a part of me reaching for the happiness I once new deep down. But every time it escapes me, I feel the void deepen. How long will it be until I can feel something other than complete emptiness? I can't take much more. Thanks for listening.",5
"names where changed and the grammer problems are because of a reading problem i have but try to read it to your best abilities 



I was born from a 15 year old mom and a 20 something year old rapist dad yeah starting even before my birth shit was messed up, when I was born it was april 22 2002 in berlin vermont surprisingly it was cold in april snowing even. So lets move to one of my first memories one day when me and my mom lived in a trailer park someone slammed a door and a glass painting fell and it went through my foot. Later in my life me and a step brother of mine where fighting and I fell through a glass table causing glass to go through my skull causing more pain from an early age.
 So later in my life my mom began to date a man named dan he as a cook in south carolina so when we move there I had my first experience in a long line of male role models due to the fact that I had no dad growing up or a consultant father figure so I developed a distain towards them but not till the second one. So my mom had a bad case of ptsd and probably bipolar disorder cause she would change from happy to pissed on the matter of seconds and this would often be in many of my memories.
 After one big fight between mom and dan they broke up and I was sen to live with my grandma but she left me with someone else till I was 6 when after that mom and dan got back together and I moved to live with them in florida. We lived in an apartment building and me and dan began to develop a father son relationship he was nice to me and taught me how to read better and build with legos and was overall an awesome guy ( at least what I can remember) but all good things must come to an end around age 9 mom and  dan broke up and me and mom moved to vermont once again. 
During the time we are we moved back me and mom lived with friends and family for a short amount of time till we became homeless for a good amount of time during the winter. And it had a major effect on me academically and emotionally. I began to develop a reading disorder and Oppositional defiant disorder which caused me to not to develop any kinds of friendship and social ties only loneliness it got to a point where the other kids saw me a scary and unstable and the school thought it was a good idea to lock me in a small room alone with only a desk and a chair and a packet of work for 7 hours a day. I became isolated and depressed at 11 at 11 years old I began to think I was not deserving to live on this world. But something around this time changed in me the boy who once saw the world ash happy and okay had changed in to a semi sociathinc ball of emotions of sadness and anger to a point where life was bland and grey.
I felt alone completely and in honestly around this time my reading disability went away but my o.c.d went away but I still was depressed and sad.mom was busy but always made time to give me affection and strict guidelines and I wished I could feel the joy of my adolescence in these times but no it was nothing but dark.
 on day after a teacher yelled at me for my different actions in the school compared to the other children I decided to act the way they wanted me to be I smiled and laughed and spoked and behaved but it was just a mask I wore so the real me would die alone in his ball of emotions, but he didn't after a solid year of wearing a mask of happy I began to convince the other people around me that I had changed  and it worked I was let out of the room and made friends with the other kids, and it almost fooled me into thinking I was happy but no I could tell that no matter how I acted I can't hide how I felt inside. Later in my life I moved to ca with my mom and her new bf and he was a grade a asshole, he made me actually try to commit suicide and my mom finally found out when I decided to jump 3 stories of a balcony and she stopped me. But steve had done the one thing no other father figure had done he got my mom pregnant with my little sister bella and that is the one good thing he ever did in my eyes cause that baby was wonderful funny and overall an awesome addition to the family but all good things must come to an end.
Steve one night found a will I wrote cause I was scared he would hurt me and he locked me up in a padded room for 2 days and that cause my depression and loneliness to come back and fucked me over . when I got home he beat the shit out of me till I started to bleed from my skin, and with that my mom gave me a gift that I will never forget âdo you want to go live with your nana, or stay here with meâ and I love my mom I truly do because she is the one coinsastant thing in my life but I couldn't stay here with that jackass and I left so much out of the story because I don't have the time and the focus to recount the entire story but on that day I took 3 planes here and begun to live with my grandma. Do I regret it sometimes but overall I am happy and semi sad at times but I am okay here

"Over the last year I have felt like my life was just getting worse and worse. I left my fiance in November of 2015, which is a long story but it boils down to I always felt like I was never enough in her eyes. I felt like she was emotionally abusive, so I left. For a time I seemed to be happy. I had just gotten out of the military (note this story has nothing to do with trauma from the military) and I moved back to my home town so I could finally see my friends and family regularly again. All seemed like it was going well. I got a job at the local hospital, I'm currently living with my sister so that's helping with money. I just feel like I'm a shell of the person I was before I met my Ex. I don't know how to be happy anymore and I don't even remember what it feels like to experience true elation for something. I use to love writing or reading, I can barely do both anymore. This is the most I've written, and meant it, in a long time. I took some of those online tests, just a minute ago, to tell me if it was possible that I was depressed. Everyone of them said, ""You are likely Severely Depressed"". This feels like I'm just ranting but I needed to tell someone this and this seemed like the only spot to put this down.",1

This is almost directly related to my social anxiety and lack of self confidence,this has been making me more and more scared to talk every minute of the day,I am now training myself to take deep breaths and slow down my speech,and have the whole sentence I want to say displayed in my brain before I say it,but even if I do all 3,there is still a 50% chance that I would mass up and look like I am going to vomit,and I can't just take random deep breaths and sudden slow of speech in a presentation,right?

I have a feeling these past months thinking my dad will die soon. I feel it's going to come and I won't be able to make him happy. I can't make him happy. I feel he's been depressed for so long. I don't know how to make him happy.  I have tried everyday to think about positive things and how I would make him happier, but I can't. My mindset is not right because he makes the family (my mom and I) unhappy everyday. He is always grumpy and I don't know how to cheer him up. He doesn't want to do anything. I don't feel like trying anymore.  

I know he's dying soon. I am so sad because of it. I am so sad I don't get to spend enough time with him to make him happy. I'm sad because I disappointed him for not working and wanting to study. He wanted me to work instead of study. But that logic is flawed. Because I need to finish school so I can get a better job. For him. But he's dying. And that makes me so unmotivated to do anything.

"I honestly feel empty all of the time. I'm super insecure and I don't really love my family, which I feel a little bad about, but I just don't. I've had to move my entire life so I don't really have any friends so I just sit in the dark all day. I really hate school, not because I'm not smart or anything, but I just have to go and see people who actually have friends/people who care about them. I go to a Catholic school and I don't believe in god so every time they pray I feel like laughing at them which just illustrates how awful I really am. I want to transfer to public school but I know I wouldn't be able to make any friends there anyway. I always have to sit with the foreign exchange students who can't even speak English (I'm american) because they are the only people who tolerate me. I think about suicide all the time but I know I probably won't kill myself because it won't change the fact that I live a completely meaningless life and Ill just fade into the void after I die. I really don't see why anyone would try to become friends with me because I have super shitty social skills, which I happened to inherit from my parents. I've been to a psychologist and it really didn't help. I have one person who I can really talk to but I want to not have to because I feel like I'm just dragging her down with me whenever I talk about how much I hate my life. The only thing that makes me feel a remote amount of happiness is money, and I honestly could care less if I lived or died at this point.

Its always been really hard for me to describe this experience but its the one thing that makes me cry almost every time, depending on how close the person is to me. and it happened again recently. its horrible how it feels.

basically not even having  confidence in your own traits and then being told you're the thing you DONT want to be and thought you were 100% not... like you FINALLY have a shred of happiness about youself but then youre told you dont even have that

I feel like every word I say is just going to bother them. I haven't been to a therapist or doctor due to my parents not believing me, hence not having any medication.

"So the best I have ever felt while on antidepressants is for like 2 or 3 days after starting (didn't feel like sleeping for ever, had some evergy, had some motivation). Then as the medication levels out I feel like crap again. This has only happened with 2 meds that I recall: cymbalta, an SNRI, and wellbutrin. The same thing happened when my doc increased the cymbalta dose. 

So what I am asking is can anyone explain this? The only logical thing I can come up with is placebo effect because you should maybe start to feel better after 4-6 weeks but I only seem to get better for 48-72 hours and then go back to feeling the same as before that. But if it was placebo, why has it only done that with those 2 medications?

The only other thing I can think of is that I have a different underlying condition that keeps counter acting the meds, but I feel like I'm just grasping at straws, but I'm sick of trying medications and the only relief I get is not wanting to die 24/7. I mean I still feel hopeless, worthless, and have passive suicidal thoughts most days.",3

'Hello, you've reached the Samaritans - how are you tonight?'

Anyway I ask because I wonder if it's typical for people without atypical depression or if the heavy feeling is a big sign that my depression is atypical. ",0
"I feel like there's a great war in my head between what I know is the 'best' way to live, and what is the 'easiest'.

Every day, I just sit inside, playing computer games. I'm struggling to do anything else at all. I could study for the upcoming exam that I have, but it's uncomfortable when I don't understand something - it gives me a headache.

Every single day, I tell myself that the next day is a 'new start' and a 'new opportunity' to better myself, but I NEVER DO.

Never. I feel like I need someone to threaten my life or... something that shakes me out of this comfort zone.

I'm well fed, clothed, I've got shelter, electricity, 'enough' money to be comfortable. 

Yet I'm extremely depressed. I know that I am disappointing myself and I know that I am capable of so much more.

"I'm 18 years old, been struggling with depression for about 2 years but it really surfaced the last few months.

I live together with my 3 best friends because my home is too far away from school. Turns out one of them stole about 750-1000 eu from my room + A LOT of weed.

I sell weed to get by because i was blown away by how expensive living on your own is. Now all of my money is gone and i'm 1300eu in debt by my dealer.

My gf was the only one  trusted and i (still) love her dearly. But unfortunately she broke up with me just now because she can't be with someone who has such a negative self image of himself, and because i was never there for her (i did everything i could but sometimes you just can't do shit because of the depression and she doesnt believe that). She also said that i am selfish and that the whole relationship revolved around me, wich was the saying that hurt me the most.

I completely lost track of my own to get her to feel good, but nah she wouldn't have it. Commenting on my best friend who is jobless atm but worked HARD everyday on roofs and such for 2 years, saying he's a loafer with no ambition and i will become the same as him got me running to my car, bawling like a little kid (wich is something that nearly never happened in the past 5 years, i'm pretty 'cold-hearted'). 

We just returned from a super nice city trip where everything was as good as it could get, wich gave me hope because i tought that might be the spark our realtionship needed (we've been struggling in our realtionship for about a month) but i guess she didn't think so...

Everyday i have this urge to just drive against a pillar or off of a bridge but i can always come to my sensen when i think about my parents, who support me A LOT.

But lately even that doesn't do the trick. I wake up and think about the best way to kill myself.

So; i try to escape. Benzodiazepines are my love now, but i know i gotta quit that shit asap. Unfortunately this can't be done atm. 

I'm too weak to do it sober.


I don't even know why i bother writing this because no one gives a fuck about me (except for my parents probably) and this'll get buried anyways.


I looked forward so much to celebrate my bday (14 january) with my gf in a cosy restaurant and its all gone to shit.

I've been numb for so long and I think a lot of people are they just ignore it. I don't want to ignore it, I want to be alive again. There's this fog in my head that I can't get through.

"All my life I've been boring, pathetic, awkward and socially incompetent. I'm so fucking sick of being the outcast in every situation and just that weird quiet girl. It's not like I don't have friends, but there's always seemed to be a limit to the extent I can connect with someone. I always end up overthinking every little interaction I have with someone to the point where I fuck it up more than I would've if I had just been myself. And over the years I've gotten so caught up in trying to be perfect that eventually I've forgotten how to just be me. 

Recently I've been talking to some people in my year on instagram. And I guess I developed a sort of âfriendship crushâ on them. They seemed so interesting and they shared and appreciated my outlook. I never really thought I'd meet someone with the same interests and opinions as me until I started talking to them. 
Something happened today which fucked everything up. They posted a picture of them at a party and I guessed I just realised no matter how much I THINK I'm connecting with them, there's no way of our friendship advancing. I've always been an outcast and I always will be and they're just as shallow as any of the other popular kids. No matter how much hope I have for finally relating to someone, most likely situation is that it's all in my head and they're just laughing about me behind my back.
I'm probably hugely over-thinking this but I can't get it out of my head and it's tearing me apart. I still want to be friends with them but I guess I'm just realising any hope I had was just pathetic me being oblivious to the fact that they don't have any interest in me. 
I guess I just needed to get that out. ",4
"Help? I'm just feeling really shitty at how I seem to have spent the majority of my time recently lying around not doing anything, letting my room and shit get into a mess and just been consumed by negative thoughts. I'm also worse at a particular time of day.

Like I've barely done anything productive this month and I hate myself for it, and I hate the fact I can't try hard enough/be bothered to help myself out of this.

Some days are better than others, yes, but at the end of the day I just can't do it. I'm 17 and wasting my fucking life being lazy and doing nothing, the new year has made me realise. I want to make resolutions but I know I can't keep them so I'm not bothering.

Any help/advice?? ",5

"Got married at 25 to my ex (then 23) after four years of dating back in 2014. She called it quits by March 2015 after less than a year of marriage. She moved out in April 2015, and I've had very little contact since last Summer. She finally got around to having us exchange divorce paperwork a few months back, and on Jan 12 we'll be having a quick trial for a no-fault divorce.

This was never a separation I wanted. I went from marriage counseling directly to weekly individual therapy last year, though I had found it unhelpful and stopped going after a few months. I feel like I annoy my friends when I try to talk to them about this, and there's always stuff going on in the back of my mind about this. I just want out of this mess, but I know in two weeks that even though there may be some legal closure, emotionally I'm not optimistic that things will be final. As a 28 year old guy, I hate that so much time has past and I still feel stuck and like shit. How do I get through this?",4
"My teacher asked me if I was suicidal. Without any preliminary. I answered nope while swearing inside. It's so annoying. Then she told me I must feel miserable and pain all the time, I am a brave fighter. Well, I would have felt more miserable or annoying , but since she'd expressed her sincere sympathy in that way too much times, I've become used to it.
""So there must be something or someone supporting me."" , she said. To this I answered nope again.
She seemed felt ambivalent, she asked me, "" if that's so then why you're sill alive. ""
Oh, tbh despite everything that's an interesting question  because I really can't come up with a good reason at first. I have no real friends. I feel lonely all the way, but I would be disturbed if someone talked to me. So technically I don't want someone keeps me company even though I feel lonely. Besides my academic performance have been getting worse and worse since the depression developed. My family see me as nothing but a pain in the neck. I can't be more useless and rebarbative. So why I haven't taken my miserable life though? Hey, after spending one day in comtemplation, I had figured it out. Can't wait to share it with my teacher, maybe she will realize she is shortening my life then.",5
"The last few years of my life have been really difficult for me. I've been dealing with a couple sexual assaults that all happened during the last 5 years. And its just really bad timing because these past few years were supposed to be me learning how to adult and shit. So instead of learning how to cook chicken or graduate college, I've been sleeping a lot, smoking weed. Trying, failing, and succeeding at coping.

Anyways. My parents do everything they can for me, but they have their own problems too and they aren't the most educated or successful people in the world (career and finances- strictly speaking). So sometimes I get a bit frustrated with them. So a couple weeks into December, and my mom tells me I have to sign up for healthcare because they are dropping me from their plan. I applied quick, but I guess since it was so close to the deadline and lots of others are doing the same, the state still hasn't followed up with me. (I was notified that I qualified, and that the next step would be to wait for a rep to contact me). 

My therapist will be back from vacation next week and I've been hanging on a thread without her. But I just realized that I might not be able to have an appointment with her if I don't have health insurance.

So right now I'm kind of in a pre panic attack state. Typing this all out kind of helped in a weird way.

"After years of different therapies, tens of therapists, the usage of nearly all anti-depressants, support groups, pursuing hobbies and practicing mindfulness etc etc...

What if I am just not meant to get better? What if it is impossible? 

My reasoning for thinking this is that what if my brain, on an evolutionary level, was simply not made to cope with all this stuff? Of course many centuries ago it really was survival of the fittest. If you were weak (mentally or physically) - you died. Nowadays with all these therapies and medications, I feel as if it is messing with my brain as it doesn't know how to cope with everything that happens and the medications that affect it.

I know that brains have the ability to evolve and change its mind paths through neuroplasticity I just feel as if it is impossible in this case.

"Hello.

I'm not depressed, but my friend is terribly blue. Their life is crumbling and I can't bear to see them like this. I care about them very much.

I don't want to reveal much information and I hope you understand.

To summarize for you all: 

* They were involved in some deep stuff.
* Some time back, they got their house broken into and while fighting the intruder(s) off, they received an injury in their head.
* The injury increased the mental illnesses they had, one of them being Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
&gt; And this resulted a rise on violent seizures, traumatizing flashbacks, haunting voices that returned to the time they were in that deep stuff, not to mention that they can barely get out of bed.

* They tried contacting with their family and friends, they tried going to professionals for help for their bodily and mental dysfunctions, but to their dismay, they (the doctors) gave up in the last moment.

* Their friends just turned their back on them and they treat them unpleasantly.

I'm one of the few friends they have left and I'm distant from them in location and I don't think there's a chance I would be able to be with them.

What can I do?",4
I was prescribed Mirtazapine some time ago because of depression and insomnia and I have been taking it for a month now. It only makes everything even worse and I think about quitting it or trying something else. Any advice? (the last time I posted something here I actually got some good advice),3
"I hate to sound like *that guy*, but does anyone here receive any professional help? I went through this shit phase once, but I've got my shit all cleared up now. Yeah, I'm still alone or whatever, but I've learned to accept it while discovering a chemical imbalance in my brain from a trusted psychologist. I mean, with this generation it's like 50% are angsty teens, upset over simple things who glorify this shit then there's another 50% who seriously suffer. Who are mentally ill. It bothers me that this sub even exists, knowing there are so many people who need help, turning to an inappropriate source. I understand a support group, but I've yet to see anything empowering here. Just shit that'll make even the sanest, happiest person kill their fucking self. 

I suggest opening completely up to someone with a degree and credentials to aid you, not a bunch of kids on the internet. There could be something seriously screwed in your psyche and you may need medication or another form of treatment. There are also infections/diseases (and types of cancer, even) that can cause severe depression and addictions in people. Most don't find out 'til too late, when it spreads or whatever. Just a few words from my head... I wish you all a great 2018! My PM is always open!",5

I've not talked about this because I don't want to put pressure on anyone, it's a miracle if I even hit enter and don't delete this message before you get online, I don't have any friends I can tell this, even you seem pretty fucking emotionally dull, our entire friendgroup isn't even emotionally attached.

"I'm currently underemployed as a sub teacher, but hardly do that.  I've let my mental health get out of control, as well as a string of bad luck that exacerbated my problems that was out of my control more or less.  I feel really committed to turning my life around and not feeling mentally ill or bad or whatever, but I don't know when to say ""Today was a good day, you did laundry, took a shower and shaved, took 1 sub job this week, and applied for one job today, exercised for three mins, meditated for 10"" 

and When to say ""that isn't enough, you can't survive this way.  You need to set the goals higher, and you should/can set them higher""

I guess, if that makes sense.  How do we set goals, do you need to practice feeling good about those goals?  As any goal achievement a good day?  I guess it's OK to feel bad about low goal achievement(IE, I shaved today, today was a good day, that feels more insane to me than thinking about killing myself)  and that you should practice feeling good goal achievement, no matter the amount or degree of goals achieved?

Is it about effort?  Can effort be enough?

"I live with my two cousins (sisters A &amp; B). One cousin I'm cool with, A. I used to live with her and just moved out due to me needing a closer house to my job so now I live with B. I've been struggling with depression most of my life but I hadn't really accepted it. To me I was raised that being depressed or bipolar or whatever is just an excuse and that I should just be normal. I have a habit of just eating everything so B confronts me about it when we go to Wal-Mart. Makes a huge lecture in the car about how ""I'm eating everything and what is wrong with me"". She's not lying so I just start thinking, *is this really how my life is going?* On the drive home, I was quiet and A took notice but dismissed it. This was two days ago.

Earlier at A's house, A and I were in the kitchen and I started talking about how I felt. B was at work. Then the conversation went to me talking about what made me sad. How I feel like I suck the joy out of others. And how I saw a video about how one guy wanted to end it, so he's basically just eating himself to death. I told her that I feel like maybe I'm doing that too.... Eating to fill a void.... I told her how I miss my family (I moved out of my dads house and he's on the other side of the country so I can't just go down the street) and how I just am generally sad, dropping out of college, etc. How eating makes me forget how I feel and I feel at peace. How I'm too scared to actually do anything so I feel like I might just be letting nature take its course. 

Her face scared me. I never have told anyone about how I felt, except for y'all. (I post sometimes.) Her face just looked like I had told her I murdered puppies or something. Part of me hated that I told her, that I was weak. But another part, and the reason I post this, feels free. I feel good that someone knows. I don't feel alone. 

She's gonna help me lose weight and focus on music to try to find something meaningful in life. I feel good. I accept that I do suffer from depression. I was diagnosed before but as I said I didn't take it seriously.

"So I've had a rough set of years, probably close to 6 now. Early on I lost loads of weight, lost myself in darkness and music, never had lights on, stayed in my room nearly all the time, slept a tonne and just isolated myself.

I've spoken to people (professionally etc) and tried pills (which I hated and stopped very fast) and I've been forced to hospitalize myself, had a psychosis evaluation, spent hours on the phone with samaritans, heard voices, panic attacks, paranoia, nearly went for CBT, been down a huge road of referrals, sliced and burnt myself, suicidal thoughts invade my head 24/7, lost all my friends, my anxiety hit the roof. Blah blah blah you all know the drill

Over time I have been getting better, little things change and slowly I feel better in myself 

These past few weeks though man I've just felt so okay, not upset at all, no telling myself to throw myself off a bridge, no urge to harm myself (how awfully embarrassing) and just generally been smiling a bit more

Thing is I don't want to feel better I think..? Now I have no reason to be my boring as fuck self. That's just who I am, a boring lonley gross waste of space. You know when you can feel a massive load of tears just behind your face waiting to come out at any second? I've had that for a while now, both a mixture of happiness and sadness

I just want about all the mistakes I made this (last?) year.

1) I took a semester off from college because I failed the semester before that. It was a big mistake that I'll now have to make up for. It strained many family relationships.

2) I didn't reach my fitness goal to finally do a pull-up. In fact, I haven't worked out the entire last month since thanksgiving threw me off my schedule.

3) I attempted suicide.

4) I failed at my attempt.

5) I went back to college and still fucked up, albeit much less so.

6) I barely got to know anyone new.

7) Despite the many compliments I receive at work, I feel they are fake and undeserved. I'm the owners son, and I know I'm a great guy, but I will always have the lingering doubt that people are nice because 'they have to be' and I'll never know who's honest.

8) Despite these compliments I'm still a kissless virgin

9) I'm so goddamn lonely.

10) I'm so lonely. I just want someone to be with.

11) I have plenty of good friends and an amazing, extremely supportive family, but for some reason, I'm still so fucking lonely.

12) I just want the lonely to go.

13) I want someone to hug me without me asking for it. I hate how I have to keep looking for attention.

14) I sent out happy new years to my closest friends and they haven't written shit back to me.

15) I'm really tired.

Alot of good things have happened this year; don't get me wrong. I've come to know a lot people and realized just how supportive my family is. But mentally, I just can't shake off this incredible feeling of worthlessness and loneliness.

"Another NYE alone..That makes 5 in a row.  Some were due to work, others my depression.  Just last week, my girlfriend of 2 years left me.  She left me to have an affair with her MARRIED co worker.  She told me she had no more time to waste on me and that she had moved on and did so a long time ago.  She just stayed with me because she felt bad for me.  These are all her words.

I know you are all probably thinking...""here comes some guy who just got dumped and he is feeling depressed so he comes here to bitch and complain.""  That is not the case.  I have had depression my whole entire life.  Im 28 and have been under serious treatment for about 4 years now.  

I have had my ups and downs, but mostly downs.  I was an alcohol and drug abuser but finally quit all of that to try and get better.  This was the first real relationship Ive ever had.  Even in HS and in college I never had someone just to call mine.  

Suicidal thoughts have swirled in my head for as long as I can remember.  At the height of my depression I began to self harm.  Nothing life threatening, but enough to draw blood and feel pain.  While this helped feelings subside a little bit...i always wished I had the balls to dig that razor in as deep as I could and just gashed up my arm.  But I am too much of a coward.

I want my life to be over...Im sick of hearing ""things are going to get better"" . ""try this new brand name medication that costs 500 bucks a bottle.""  ""youre a great guy just give it time""

I have not seeked medical advice as I dont know where to start and what to say. I dont know what made me this way and I just wish it was as simple as popping to the shops and buying some pills to make it all better. There is more important things in the world than me and I dont want to waste anyones time.

I used to cope by keeping myself busy and pushing myself to do anything and everything to avoid having to sit with just my own thoughts for company. But its beating me and the motivation to do anything is becoming none existent, it's like I want to but I cant push through the voices in my head and the pressure on my chest.

My friends seem to be becoming more and more distant with little understanding on whats going on with me but too wrapped up in their own lifes.

A hand full of my work collegues seem to be going through a similar thing but can come off quite judgemental and I honestly think if I confided in them they would just think I was after attention and 'jumping on the bandwagon'. And the other hand full slag off depression as if it doesnt exist or they are worse off as if its a competition.

My family have their own issues and I feel as much as they would love to help they need to focus on themselves and each other.

My boyfriend is the one person I thought I could rely on to speak to and make me feel at comfort if not better when im at my worst but nearly a month ago he nearly broke up with me. I fear its gotten too much for him. He has since said he didnt mean it and you dont realise what you've got until its nearly gone but its broken me.

Nobody thinks self harm when it's just bruises. But now he's weighed down with my bullshit as well.,5
"I don't think Im enough. I was never enough. I was never the best one, the prettiest one, the smartest one. I was always that goofy girl that laughs at everything. That girl with no talents. That girl that nobody has a crush on. That girl who is used by her ""friends"".

Why do the worst things always happen to me? So many people I cared about left. I forgot how it feels to be happy. I just want to end it all. I just want to die. Nobody will care. Nobody ever cared about me. Noone cares about my feelings.Why? I care about everyone, Im always there to help, always there to listen, to be a shoulder to cry on. But when I need a hug, or someone to listen to me, everyone is ""busy"".",5
"I'm 18 and have never really been able to make any friends.  I spent this new year alone again.

Hearing about my parents talking with old school friends about who used to go out with who, and asking me how my 'love life' is going keeps reminding me of how unlikely it is I'm ever going to function in society.  My parents met and started going out when they were younger than me and I'm still a virgin.

My ssris don't cure my loneliness and only help in a superficial, enough energy to get out of bed sort of way.

Idk why I'm posting this but I really just want to die, I have since I was 11 and have thought about it just about every day since I was around 13.  I just don't see anything to look forward to in life.  Every day I wake up and force myself to go to the gym, then sit around all day trying to find something good to watch or get enough energy to do something productive, then lie in bed and can never fall asleep within 6 hours.  Even youtube sucks now.

I'm so sleep deprived and lonely, hopefully I'll just die from a heart attack or a stroke or something.

I don't know what it is that I'm doing wrong, it seems to come to most people so naturally - socialising - but I guess I'm just not one for life.",4
"It doesn't matter who does or does not see this, at this point. I just want to get it off my chest. This isn't a success story. This isn't uplifting. I am a broken man who couldn't fix myself, even a little bit. I lost the person I love, and I have nothing else. All I want right now is people to talk to, people I can pretend are friends. All I want is to die or have my love back, and I can't have either. Don't be like me.


This is a direct continuation of the last part. My therapist and I were still getting to know one another and were communicating primarily through messages, as I wasn't really comfortable with more. Once we began having actual sessions, there will be bits and pieces missing that I really can't account for too well.



&gt;  Hello ///// - Thank you for openly sharing your views about yourself, your beliefs and the relational history and status with your siblings. This could not have been easy, yet you did it. I wonder if the traumatic experiences you had made survival possible only if you were able to believe that you didn't matter. It's interesting because the very thing that you want to be able to give your partner is locked away even from you. I also wonder if doing things for the benefit of others is protective for you because it keeps you from expecting anything, thus never again being let down.

&gt; ///// - I know that you talked about not having faith in yourself or believing in yourself, because if you did you would have done ""more than you have"". Your honesty and the truth as you see it is welcomed and valued in this space. Have you ever had the experience of losing something, beginning to look for it and then finding something else that was previously lost? Perhaps this is what will occur for you on this journey. It doesn't matter WHY you are here , only that YOU ARE and that you are WILLING to consider multiple perspectives on what may be going on inside of you that is impacting your symptoms, relationships and view of self. I have a suspicion that you are actually willing , you just need a good, sturdy, yet flexible and toxic free bridge to hope. This IS your time /////. This may be what you have been waiting for all of your life. Remember, the journey of a thousand miles, begins with ONE step.

*Hello, //////.*

*I don't know about it not being easy. For the people I actually trust, it is easy to divulge basically every thing. For those I don't, they will never know me. But I understand that it is vital to this particular relationship to forgo any subterfuge. If I had mattered to those who wronged me, they would not have done so. If I had mattered to myself, I would not have let those things happen. To say I was a child and knew no better stopped being a legitimate excuse when I turned 18. After that point, it's just been me fucking up without excuse. I know better, and I still keep fucking up. I don't know how to break myself from the cycle.*

*I don't know if I agree with that last bit, because, even though my interest or intent may not be for my own benefit, I do expect to occasionally result in theirs. To make them happier, to make their life better, to earn a place in it. I have never been successful in the end. That is a crippling kind of failure, feeling let down is an understatement. I am, each and every time. When it comes to my partners, there's nothing I don't try to give, nothing I'm not willing to do. And yet it always seems that I don't actually commit to that, I always let THEM down. And then myself when that relationship crumbles. It is no less devastating each time it happens.*

*I... Don't really know if I'd had that particular experience, no. I don't think I've ever really been 'looking' for anything, besides a relationship I can count on. I have stumbled blindly into and out of every relationship, every hobby or interest, every place I've ever been. I have never had a plan. I have always just winged it and saw how it turned out. The answer is, never really any good.*

*I believe that to say you want something is fine, but to not follow up is proof that you do not actually want that thing. To say, ""I wanna go there"" and then NOT go there makes you a liar. If you really wanted it, wouldn't you have done it? If I really wanted to be in better shape, wouldn't I have done it by now? No, I just don't want to do it badly enough. This is the first and only time I've tried to follow through, and even then, I do not think it may actually benefit my current reason to do so. I think I may have damaged my relationship to the point it cannot be fixed.*

*I'm more than open to other perspectives. For what it's worth, I know you're not wrong. I know the things you're saying are true. At least, the locked away part. The believing in myself, waiting for my time. I know you're not wrong in those things. I just can't believe in them, myself. I wish I could, but something keeps me from doing it. All that cliche crap about ""where there's a will there's a way"" and never giving up, some part of me really wants to believe it because I know it's a way out of this. I just don't know how to do that.*

*I tend to ramble, by the way.*

"I can't fucking sleep at all and I can't stop crying out of anxiety. I spent the past seven hours googling and getting worked up over a stupid medical procedure I need to get and that then morphed into me wanting to die. I'm anxious as hell and can't stop thinking about it. 

What's the point in living life if everything causes you pain? What did I do to deserve this? I didn't ask to be thrust into this fucking world without any say. I can't stop thinking about how life is just too painful to not be worth it at all. It's not, really. It sucks that I'd hurt so many people if I died, and it makes me angry that I have this shit holding me back from ending it all. I know they'd feel a certain way. But what about my feelings?! Why should I push through just so everyone around me can feel okay?",5
"The company i work for is in a moving process so many departements are left vacant or just stuff that isnt picked up yet to the new location. Wich typically means fridges with plenty of old food in it and beer, and i had to work christmas and i allready went through a difficult time and i am still doing it. I just got some bright idea that all the beer around the building werent going to be missed so i took some of it (4 cans all in different departments...) thinking that it wouldnt be missed since they have allready left... And i felt somekind of Â«fuck you mentalityÂ» too them since they were the ones that put me on this shift and never give anything in return... i drank the beers when i got home and dissolved further into my missery till my mom had to throw me into the ER a few days later. Now on sick leave and just got home, i have felt a big regret for stealing the beer... Fuck... I cannot grasp why i even had the thought of doing this and i dont know what to do if they find out!!!  Its just some cheap beer i could easily buy for 10 bucks and now my job can be on the line because of this... idk what to do!!! I feel so ashamed!!! It`s not the first time doing something really stupid while depressed but this is just a small inane stupid thing i did wich can have big consequences for my stupid shitty life.. i cant bear it and its making it all worse!!!

"Not sure how to word this,
I'm never really content with where I am. My insecurities always resurface and force me to over analyze myself when I'm with people I want to be cool with or whatever. 
Does anyone else ever get that voice in the back of there head saying that you're not enough? How do you personally combat these things? I used to think this kind of depression was an exaggeration but when it hit me I was like shit. It's gotten to the point where I feel hopeless when I'm by myself when in fact I know there is hope.",5
"For about a year and a half now, I've been having these really bad headaches that usually last for days. Lately they've even gotten so bad that I've passed out. I've seen doctors about it and none of them could find anything wrong, so I was wondering if it might be part of my depression. Does anyone else have this issue?",3
I feel like a loser because I do not have a group of friends. I have friends but I do not have a group of them to be with while I'm at college. I feel like a loser because I'm always alone. Unfortunately I'm to blame because I am extremely introverted and self conscious. I'm self conscious to the point where I won't be friends with people because acquaintances mocked them frequently. I'm very lonely. I began to use weed as a coping mechanism for my depression and we all know how that has turned out. I'm very low risk because I believe that I have more to live for. I'm just tired of feeling alone. ,4

"I grew up being raped and molested by my step dad from age 5 to 11 and once by an uncle at age 7. I have witnessed 7 suicides in my life, 4 of them infront of me and the others I walked in on after it was done. I have been beaten daily till I was bleeding or my step dad got tired of hitting me from age 5 to 17. I was homeless from 18 to 27, I never knew my real dad but for a few months before he died of liver failure, I was 23, then at 25 my mother committed suicide. at the age of 37, I have PTSD and severe depression and severe social anxiety. 

for the past 8 years I have been on this site and many others trying to find someone to build a connection with, get close too, make memories with, share things with, eventually build a life together and become a serious couple that settled down.

For the past 8 years I have been told I am ugly, disgusting, worthless, useless, told I have nothing to offer anyone, told I don't deserve love or a relationship or a woman, told I need to kill myself.

For the past 8 years I have been lead on by a couple women who pretended like they wanted me and was interested in me and after 5 or 6 months of this, they would fake their death or call me having sex with someone or disappear then turn around and stalk me.

I have been rejected over 2 thousand times in the past 8 years all because I am obese, I struggle with low thyroid, a very slow metabolism, and genetics from both parents being obese, and just found out that I have very low testosterone, although I have a high sex drive. All of these issues plus my PTSD effects my weight and makes a breeding ground for obesity as my Dr. has put it. I walk 3 miles a day, I eat healthy, baked chicken, boiled veggies, etc. I stay away from soda pops but once a week I will drink a soda, once a month I will eat a pint of ice cream. it helps me stay on track and away from fast food and deep fried stuff. But it doesn't matter, because of my health issues that are causing the obesity.

But see, yet no one wants to get to know that about me, no one wants to get to know anything about me, they just see the outside of me and what income I have then reject me. No one cares for who I am as a person, no one cares for how I am as a person, no one cares what I am like as a person, no one cares about my personality or attitude. No one cares how I would treat them. They just see my weight then walk away.

I may not have much in the looks department to offer, I may not have much in the money department to offer. But what I did have to offer was pure true unconditional love, true loyalty, a heart filled with pure love and a mind filled with acceptance and understanding. someone who wouldn't ever cheated or left, or ever played mind games, someone who would been so loyal to you, someone who would have treated you with gentle care and love. someone who would been very romantic and devoted.

Well, I give up looking, I am done looking. I am to the point I just don't care if I ever find anyone or ever be with anyone. well this is my good bye letter to all the women on here. I hope many of you who I crossed paths with are proud of yourselves for how you did me and how you treated me. and for those of you who I never talked too, sorry we never got a chance. if you would have given me one.

I am just done with it all. I just can't take anymore and am ending it tonight. ",1
"Some stuff about me (don't think of it as bragging, which is shouldn't, because every other day I feel like sleeping and never waking up, so there's not much to brag about):

Studying math, CS at a good university. Doing great in school, 4.0, even accelerated some courses to get ahead a year. Did research, on bound to get into a great grad school.

Come off from a well off family. I could not work a single day in my life and live comfortably, or run our family business and easily earn 400k/yr.

Am good looking, have a girlfriend and many friends

Despite this, I'm feeling very depressed and inadequate, which is obvious since I'm writing this post 30 minutes before a new years party I'm going to.

I look around and there are people my age who are multimillionaires running successful companies, singers with millions of followers, or sons of billionaires. There are others who studied whatever math I've studied till now (enough to pass quals at most grad schools) in high school and are doing their PhD at Harvard at 20. 

How do I stop feeling inadequate compared to these people? I'm terrified at the idea that I'll live a normal life, working 9-5, getting paid well but not nearly enough and die at 75 without anyone but my family giving a shit. I know that in the end after we die, nothing matters, whether I'm the average james or some famous singer. But I don't want to waste my life being the average james, and I don't think I can do anything to change it. Thought about creating a startup, but what are the chances of it being very successful (much more than my family's current business)? Probably none. Maybe in another life I'll get a better ""stats roll"", like more intelligence, or the ability to sing or play some sport at a high level.",2

Unfortunately, as I'm sure many of you have also experienced, it tends to flare up in waves at a time and it can seriously affect me in ways that affect our relationship. Last night he said that he thinks I'm not comfortable around him anymore, when the reality is that I'm really uncomfortable with myself and am always self-conscious about it. I was able to get him to come around eventually, but I can tell that this really gets to him. Will it eventually subside? Is it just something I have to deal with? I'm just feeling so... frustrated.",3
"Just the idea of being able to leave this reality and just be drunk alone at home is comforting, not needing to care or be there.

They say to cheer up or to stay distracted, that it will pass. It's easier to have a reason for being sad but when you don't even know why you're hurting- it's so unbearable. I have no one in my life who understands. My mind is breaking. I'm breaking. I feel so crazy. I try to win but I'm always losing to my self. I hate my thoughts. I'm so afraid of how I'm feeling, how nasty it fees to be depressed. I can feel every single negative emotion creeping  up all over my body. There's time when I just want to go to a psych home. I'm afraid of what I'm becoming. I hate who i am. I'm nothing.",5

ive pushed people out of my life when i shouldnt have, because they cared for me and i didnt know how to respond.

ive been ungrateful, rude, and lazy, and just wanted things i can never have. i want to say sorry to all those i've hurt.

i hate my body and am seriously struggling with my identity.

i live so far away from so many of my friends and i dont know where to look for support.

i cry almost every day and feel sick almost all the time down to my stomach. im not satisfied with anything that i do and i feel like im spiralling further and further without any way of getting back.

im unfulfilled, and im lonely. i hate myself for so many reasons but cant face up to the fact that the reason im here is my own fault.

i miss my girlfriend who i pushed away for lots of reasons. i dont know if it was the right decision but i hate myself for doing it because she didnt deserve that. i miss the way things were. i miss feeling loved and cared for, and even when things were bad i knew that someone was thinking about me and at least wanted the best for me. i dont think we worked all of the time particularly well but i would have put up with that at the time had i known how sad it would make me.

im struggling with my degree.

im sleeping too late but i like the night too much to stop.

i feel like im a ghost and i dont find love in anything anymore. im so desperately lonely but i dont want to let anyone else down. im just really sad and i need help but when i get that help i pretend everything is ok.

i told one of my friends my issues on new years and i think i said too much and i am scared my secret will get out about how i really feel about myself. im not ready for people to know, let alone myself.

i dont want to die, i just want another chance to start over, as someone else. but i cant so im stuck in this life without any escape.

"This has been going on for years, but it wasn't till today that I noticed it was happening. I get this sence of relief when I reach out towards people to hang out, but they tell me they can't.

It happened to me today, I was home alone and craving human contact. I called my friend to see if he wanted to hang out, but he tells me that he couldn't cause he was working. I then get a sense of relief, and I'm happy for all of two seconds cause I get to stay home, but the happiness fades, and I'm back to being depressed cause I can't hang out.

The opposite also happens. When my friend tells me that he can hang out, I get this feeling of dread, and I have to force myself to not cancel my plans. After we hang out, I ended up exhausted and tired, but a little bit less depressed.

Am I the only one that is a mess of contradictions?",5
"Hello all. I'm a college freshman home for winter break. I'm feeling really alone. My old friend group from high school kinda grew away from me as I went to a different high school, so I've been seeing plenty of snaps and Facebook posts about them hanging out together and being really close but have never been invited or even reached out to. I was really close to church friends through my junior year but I basically vanished my senior year because my dad left my family, I had to work, and I had to get myself a scholarship to college (which I did). They're all like a big family, and while they include me in stuff, I cannot escape the feeling that I'm just a guest there, not a member of that family. 
I did get a full ride to William and Mary (I'm from Florida), which meant I go to school out of state, while most of them going to state schools. Most of them still see each other all the time and are super close, while I've had to start over. It kinda hurts to see my college friends hanging out with their friends from home and still being super close to them while I don't really have that luxury.
There is one guy who I think I'll be friends with the rest of my life. He was my best buddy in high school and we're still really close. And my girlfriend, who goes to school in DC, is home too so I can see her. I'm grateful for them but wish I had a bigger friend group from home that I was still close to.
I've loved college, but haven't really found a new best friend yet. I've still kinda struggled with feeling like an outsider and not really fitting in. I have plenty of surface friends, but I want a close, supportive friend group more than anything in the world, and I hope it's not too late. Is it?
Can anyone relate to this? Is it weird to not be close with people from high school? How can I get rid of these feelings of loneliness and feeling like I'm a failure? How can I find what I'm looking for in college?",2
Yup. Everyone is out getting drunk and being reckless (like every other 19 year old). Here I am in  a empty parking garage eating McDonald's because my parents forgot to save me some dinner. I hate my life. ,3

At this point, I just want to spend the rest of my life in my room, unemployed. I'll receive an inheritance if I'm lucky. My mom gets up early everyday to go to her job where she's been for 20 years. I know I have some major depression issues, but there are lazy bums in this world, who are unemployed and live at home until they're 40, or forever, and I think maybe I'm just one of those bums, regardless of depression.",2
"Over the past several months, I've had some incredible highs and some incredible lows. I had been really struggling for a few months, but lately I seemed to be on an upswing. Something about NYE really brought me down though. The night itself seems to synonymous with ""fresh starts"" and ""new beginnings."" For me, it felt lonely. Since NYE I've been super depressed again -
defined by the idea that I am not hopeful and any fresh start I have will inevitably lead to another dead end. 

Will a fresh start change the way I look or change how attractive I am? Will a fresh start make me more likable? More outgoing? More equipped to make friends and meet new people?

The truth is, it doesn't matter how many fresh starts I am given: I will always, fundamentally, be the same person, and I will continue to let forces outside of my control define who I am as a person. I recognize how pessimistic this is. I recognize that this way of thinking doesn't do anything to help me. I just needed to rant. ",5
"It's like there's some fucking hole in me I can't ever permanently fill. I feel like a hollow shell. Sure I can do shit to distract myself from it, but when I'm alone with my thoughts and nothing else, I just feel so lonely and empty. Distractions temporarily fill up that stupid hole. I can watch TV all day and not think about it too much. I can go out and get drunk. I can listen to music. But the minute the distractions are gone I'm just stuck with myself, and I'm just there. Just existing. None of it actually matters; I don't actually have any passion or will to live. I'm just scraping by and trying to forget about how shitty I feel.

There's one thing I've found makes me feel completely fine, if only temporarily; infatuation. I fall head over heels for girls, and I think it's definitely linked to how shitty I feel. The thing is though I'm a virgin. All these crushes go unrequited, and they only get worse. In high school they were pretty tame, but since leaving I've had 2 massive ones that basically took over my life for their duration, one that's still going on right now. The first one the girl wasn't ever really interested in me. She was friendly enough, and we clicked a little, but it was always this forced awkwardness to it. I barely knew her, not really. We never had anything but surface level conversations. It didn't go anywhere at all, but I built the whole thing up so much in my head that it took me months and months to get over her.

Then I became friends with this other girl. Real, genuine friends, which is rare for me. I found someone I have a genuine connection with. It made me feel amazing that I'm capable of that deep connection. And instead of being able to just enjoy that, my stupid fucking brain makes me fall for her. She's literally my best friend man, and I'm hopelessly into her. She's the only one I ever open up to, even if it's just a little. But she has a boyfriend, and while sure we get along great and support each other and shit, I know somewhere deep down she just doesn't see me that way. But it doesn't matter. Cause that hole's there. And while she's in my life, it's filled. And as pathetic as it sounds, it's kind of worth the pain of seeing the girl you're so into being with someone else, because at least I'm not alone. I have someone to message all day. Someone who cares whether I'm actually alive. Someone who depends on me. It means the world.

But it's just not healthy. It's a temporary solution to a permanent problem.  The problem is that I'm just fucking broken somehow. I'm just empty inside. And even though being around her makes me feel like I'm someone worth a damn, someone that I could grow to like, really deep down I'm still hollow man. And seeing her with someone else kills me, just in a different way. But it's either that or go back to feeling completely alone. And the thing is, no girl wants a guy who's this down on himself and lacking in self-confidence.

People always say that you need to love yourself before you can love someone else, but it feels like my flaw as a person is that I can't love myself unless I feel like someone else does. But nobody ever truly does. So I take the closest I can get and cling to it desperately, because if I don't I'm just alone with myself. Why the fuck am I like this? I feel like my full life I'm gonna go through this cycle over and over. It just sucks. I hate myself even more for being that asshole who's hopelessly into a girl with a boyfriend. I feel like one of those stupid ânice guys' for even complaining about her not feeling the same. But I just wish that once somebody would feel for me the same way I feel for them. I look for that love thinking it will fix me, but honestly I don't think it would. I don't know how to fix it in all honesty.",4

Ive also realized that I've been limiting myself to doing things that might trigger his depression or that it will worsen it. For example, he doesn't really like going out but I enjoy the occasional dance night with my friends or something and I feel like he dreads me going out and if I do he gets really sad. So I've tried to stay in, which is still fun for me,but if I ever want to go out i just don't want to make him worse. 
Im very new to relating to people with depression and I would love to have some advice for people that have had a partner that has helped them with their own depression or how have you yourself dealt with a relationship like that.

I have conquered many battles in my life, sexual abuse by relative and school peers, drug addiction and acute self harming. Ive had awful relationships where i guess i was trying to fill the emotional void my father left inside my soul. The father of my child was abusive and an alcoholic and a drug addict. He got over his issues and is really a changed man and we get along fine. I still feel bad for not making us work or succeed. Like many things in my life, it was a huge failure. Ive tried practically everything to feel better, excersise, therapy, talking with friends etc, but now i have hit a low point in my life and i dont know really if i can recover.
I started a new relationship almost a year ago, i am in love with this man and i suffer every day. He is perfect, professional and amazing. He is bit older than me. He is cold and hot with me every month and shuts me down every now and then. Ive done everything to make it work but he has left me again and now for good. I cant believe its over. I gave my heart and soul to this relationship and now its done. I loved him and gave him everything he needed. Now he hates me and has blocked me from everything while i beg for him to come back. One week ago he told me he loved me and gave me a beautiful ring, now im devastated and alone.
I take care of my mother and child. I have a decent job and no financial worries atm.
I feel like the worst mother on earth, like scum and i really want to die at moments and have attempted numerous times.

At the last moment, Bran presses his mouth up to the hole and roars with raw pain and loss, at the top of his voice, âBec!â It's the only time he's ever uttered my name. Anyone's name. His anguished cry stabs at my heart and tears spring to my eyes.

"Haven't had a job since getting out of the military ~1 yr ago. I've purged most things from my life and am finally selling my house this month. All in all I'll have no debt, car+dog, ~$40k, and ""full"" medical + $1300/month in va benefits. 

~30, Loner, high iq, attractive, atheist, engineering background, several tinder flings last year. 

My residing in bed with a mountain of inertia has left me with needing two tooth caps, devolving physical fitness, increasing neuroticism, cynicism, etc etc. classic depressive spiral. 

I'm considering paying for expensive non-va counseling. Being stuck circling the drain is costly but so is seeking a historically futile chance at therapy. 
 I sometimes wonder if it would be easier to hire a person to simulate being the subconscious driving force that all normal people have moving them forward in their various directions...if only to get me in a habit of being that kind of person.

"So, hey. 

I'm coming to this sub because... I feel empty, again. 
I just took my antidepressant for the day, and I still feel like depression is creeping in. 

About two months ago, I stopped going to school. It was either that or, you know, a mistake. I had to breathe. Two years ago, I already took a break because of depression, and saw what I could be without it. It was awesome. And now.. I'm missing school again. I feel emptier and emptier, and dumber every day. A few months ago I was doing amazing things, considering becoming something i'd never even dreamed of. Now, I have all of the possibilities for a better future, and yet i'm sinking in the terrible depths of my stupid brain. 

I can't come back to a regular sleeping schedule ; I keep thinking wht I should do today, etc. But then, my brain stops me :

""Why bother ? Nothing is important. Your success, your creation, doesn't impact anyone. And even if it did, it would be but a speck on billions of people. You're just trying to fill your time until you grow old and ultimately be alone. ""

Jesus, even typing this is horrible. But I can't stop thinking this is terribly true. I keep realizing i'm not intelligent. That it was something adults told me when I was young, I just rolled with it until the truth hit like a wall. And yet, my most happiest times were when I felt dumber. That I ignored the reality. I don't want to feel even stupider. 

I'm scared

"I'm just so fed up at this point and tired with the world...I didn't ask to be born into this system of mind-numbing working just to make a living. I never chose to have any loved ones or family, which at this point really just prevent me from killing myself; I don't want anyone to love me, I don't even want help, I just want to stop existing. I constantly feel like I'm drowning as if I was tossed into a whirlpool and I can't get out no matter how hard I flail. I feel like a failure every step of the way because I'll never live up to anyone expectations, not even my own. I'm so lost. I didn't want any of this and I still don't but I can't end it because of earthly ties I didn't want in the first place.

"I have a long story but don't feel like giving all the details right now..

I graduated high school 6 months ago. I was supposed to move elsewhere and work for about a year before deciding whether I should go to college. Those plans didn't take place, so... I've been staying at home since then.

Yet, long before that (Perhaps for the past 2 or 3 years), I've been really declining, just barely passing my classes and even failing calculus twice. Slowly spiraling into depression although I was never  sure until now.
And now that I'm out.. I'm pretty much depressed. So many things that stress and worry me. I can never get anything done, I never feel interested in anything, I always feel tired.. And yet my mom has kind of been pushing me into getting a job while the move situation gets resolved. It really seems like the right thing to do.
Yet the idea just feels terrifying. Like I KNOW I should find one, bu I also dread the idea. Probably my anxiety acting up, but also because I worry it'll only make me worse. I'm constantly on-edge and just about anything can ruin my mood for the rest of the day. In my mind, I tell myself that I'm in no condition to work full-time but then I feel guilty because that might just be an excuse.  
And just a few minutes ago, a cousin messaged me saying there was a spot I could take at a hotel that he works at. And again.. That feeling of dread, the guilt for even feeling like this, and overall just wanting to decline but not knowing how to say it.

"I'm sorry if this seems to be a ramble, but I need to get this out. I've been reading this sub for a while, but made a new account to comment. Sometimes I find it helpful to get everything out, and I don't have anyone left to get things out to who won't try and pity me. 

Depression runs in my family, but I'm probably using that as a crutch or an excuse. I think I'm depressed.

I go through stages of downs and (sort of) ups, though those usually manifest themselves as drives to fix the problems in my life - while never working out and making the situation worse.

Today my girlfriend called me selfish. Truth is, it's her birthday tomorrow and I haven't gotten her anything. She knows this, I haven't even gotten her a card. The reason is, I have a lot of personal debt - we both do. I spent my last Â£2 on a sandwich yesterday so that I could eat, and now I have to hope that the rest of the month ""works out"" somehow. It's 13 days until pay day.

I don't have a bad paid job, but circumstances this Christmas left me short for cash - I usually run out a few days before pay day not two weeks.

She knows about my debt, some of it's hers, but I she doesn't seem to get it, how bad it is.

"I feel bad bc I had to turn away the pest control guy today bc my apt was too messy. The last time the pest control people came apparently they complained to my landlord bc the apt was so messy, and then the landlord sent an email scolding me. It pisses me off bc imo as long as I'm not doing any structural or permanent damage to the property I should be able to live in filth if I want to. But I also know that the way I'm living now isn't healthy. I'm just reluctant to clean bc cleaning up would require admitting to myself that the way I'm living now isn't normal or good for me. 

I also find it difficult to eat. I keep cooking too much pasta, realizing I don't want to eat (even when I'm hungry), and leaving it out to stick to the pan or rot. (Yep, turns out if you leave pasta in the sink for a while green stuff will grow all over it!) I think it's partly bc I like the light-headed feeling of not eating enough and drinking too much coffee. It's basically a cheap and easy way to get high. But lately whenever I ""eat well"" I end up getting intense stomachaches anyway. I had a steak yesterday bc I knew I needed protein but I ended up just getting stomach cramps and diarrhea. 

My dad died when I was young and my mom went back to work. She would always have to get up early and would get mad at me for making dinner late (I've always been a night owl) or not doing the dishes. In retrospect I totally understand why she'd get so mad (I *was* being disrespectful) but basically it just made me feel intense shame and that everything I do in the kitchen is basically filthy and gross. Also if I i.e. washed the dishes but didn't put them in the dishwasher she'd get just as mad and I think I unconsciously internalized that unless I completely clean up the kitchen I may as well just let everything sit around and rot. 

My main motivation to clean up would be so I could have friends over without feeling ashamed. (So far I've only let one person who I trust see my apt and I still felt like a gross weirdo.) 

The thing is actually I find dish-washing very calmly sometimes. I've found that concentrating on thinking about the process and how cleaning dishes is satisfying makes me want to clean a lot more than beating myself up about how everything is disgusting. 

Anyway does anyone have any advice for getting yourself to clean things up beyond ""break it into small steps"" ",4

Maybe my thoughts of worthlessness and being the worst person can fade away. Maybe I need help. Maybe my dark and scaring thoughts can go away. Maybe someone will read this and can understand or maybe relate to this. Just maybe ... 
 

So let me take you back. Think of this boy 16 years old just moved, for the 3 time in 5 years. His mom was kind of his Idol. She was always there and she was able to keep me safe and protect me a little bit from my strict dad. 
Friends a had a few. I switched schools a few times so I didn't make a lot. Some were colleagues some work classmates. O and I mustn't forget, I had a girlfriend. She's my first girlfriend and she was a
2 year older then me. I don't think I really liked her that much, but for the first time someone liked me instead of falling for a girl that's way out of my league. So I stuck with her for a while. 

So almost immediately after we moved my parents started fighting. They did this before but not as much as they did now. The fights were different. They didn't had a subject, they were just fighting for the heck of it. My sisters, of which I have 2, didn't live with us anymore. They moved out and the youngest one only went back once every few weekends. They didn't notice it as much, but even they could tell something was wrong. 

After a few months my mom decided it was time to go to her parents, she would talk with them about my parents relation. On that moment I got back from work and my sister was back home as well. When we sat down, my dad's phone when off. He got a text from my mom, but it wasn't addressed to my dad. It said something as follows:

Hi dear, just talked to my parents, Hmm. Doesn't look that bright anymore. Probably won't take long any more, hmm. Miss you, love. 

This is all I remember off it and it's translated so it won't be 100% but you'll get the gist of it. And you'll also probably guess this wasn't supposed to go to my dad. It's was meant for someone else. My dad, sister and I all read the message, and could believe our eyes. What does this mean, what will happen now? 

At this point is was scared, no frightened. Frightened of the thought my parents would divorce. Frightened of the thought that I'm probably going to have to choose a side. Choose between the person you trusted with whole your life, but now seems can't be trusted and the person that was always strict. 
When my mom got back from her parents, she asked for my dad to come outside with her cause something went wrong and she had to explain her self. She told a very nice story. It's just how she and her colleagues texted with each other. For a second I wanted to believe that. I wanted it to be true,. But I knew it's probably not. This will be marked as the start of the divorce it thought to myself. 
My sister and I talked to her, she promised the didn't lie, that's she  old be trusted and she would never do such a thing. Yet again, I wanted to believe it so for then, I just accepted it, went upstairs and tried to sleep. 
Like I said this night would be marked as the start of the divorce, but it's also first thing I can recall what is damaging me I guess. After this night I can't remember a lot. It feels like my recordings have stopt for a few days / weeks. 
The next event I know, but I'm not totally sure where it fits in the time line, is coming downstairs on Sunday too see my sitting at the diner table, crying. Crying his heart out. Being broken by the months and months of arguing with my mom about nothing. He was devastated and didn't know what to do anymore. At that moment I didn't know what to do. I wanted to comfort him, but I didnt feel present at that moment. My sister was already up and she was talking to him. Trying to calm him down. 
Like I said I didn't k ow what to do. I wanted to hug him, but he always had seem to be arms length away from me. The thing I regret the most now about this, is that I was too scared of my own emotions to stay or to comfort my dad. I took my stuff and went to work. At work time stood still. It was comforting cause I  could clear my mind but also upsetting cause I wanted to go to my family. I wanted to know what was going on. I talked to my girlfriend who was working at the same place at the time. She didn't really help. She didn't have that much empathy and couldn't really listen to my story. When my shift ended I went home and that's the last I remember about it. 
At times I think the evening marked as the start was adjacent to the Sunday morning, but that just doesn't seems right. 

The last event before the divorce that I know is the most haze one. I only k ow a few things. I was up in my room, I wasn't alone. But I don't know if a friend was there or my girlfriend. My dad was at home. So it's probably a Saturday or Sunday. 
Suddenly my mom opens the door and tells me she packed a few things and is going away. I remember her asking me something. I don't know what. I belive it was either: do have anything to say go my? Or : would you care to join me? 
Either way I stayed in my room and that's the last I know of it. 
It turned out my dad had heard her over the phone, talking to a friend of hers, saying ""I know it's wrong, but when ever I hear his voice, it's like falling in love again"". This is when my dad said she should pack a back and go. 

Soon after this broke up with my girlfriend, the fact that I didn't really like her that much and I didn't fell that well and she could help me pushed me over the ledge to do it. 

So when my mom got out of the house she stayed a few weeks in her colleagues home. He didn't life there cause he just moved in with his girlfriend I believe, but I'm not sure. Our dad forced us a couple of times to get over there. Talk to to her, he always said ""don't forget, she's still your mother"". 
I found it extremely difficult, just talking to her, she broke my trust, She made my dad cry.  I didn't k know what for say but the fact that I was disappointed or even discussed by her mad when feel bad. And I wanted her to feel bad. I wanted her to feel the worst of us all. She'd deserved that. I deserved that, but she didn't. Or maybe she did but she never showed after that one night. 

Within a year she told us she had met someone else. When we asked of he was this person she meant to text during the first event. She promised us this is someone else. An old friend. It was my dad's best friend, at least I believe he was. They even had a certificate about it, and they both had it hanging in the hall way. 

After she promised, after we started to believe we found out he was that person all along. It also turned out that my mom talked and went to him even before the whole arguing started. Phone records showed everything she did and for how long it went on. Even showing this she held on to her lie. This is the hardest part of trusting someone, trust in someone is as strong as they are believable. my mom, not so much. 
After a while I found a girl, who was amazing. I thought she was beautiful. From the moment I first layed eyes on her I though, damn this is something else. 
And she was. It took me some time to persuade her. She first wanted to stay friends and such. The  she fooled around with someone else. That was the first time she hurt me actually. She lied about that. Maybe that was some kind of sign, maybe not. After that I tried again  and succeeded. She was officially my girlfriend and I've never felt better at that point. 
We did a lot together but not everything. So we had space to our self. She was needy though, but not too much. After being together for almost a year I decided to move. I wanted to stay in dorms close to my school, and so I died. At first the didn't like that. She wanted to keep me close. But I couldn't stand the traveling for 3-4 hours a day. Eventually the was OK with that. 
After half a year she went studying as well. She learned new people and I was very happy about it. She would get more grown up and that's what is was hoping for her. But, as she said afterwards, she got bored with me. But she didn't want to break up. I thought everything was still OK. When the next event happend. 
She wanted me to come with her to church for Christmas. You must understand, I've never been to a church before. At least not as a not tourism thing. So after a few I thought we'll off course, for her I will. 
So I went with her and her family. And I think it was one of the worst things I've been too. Like the priester would got on and on about how people should live more closely to the Bible. People didn't respect it as much. And I was sitting there, not even red a bible, not even a few words. 
Afterwards there was no thank you from her. She didn't look amused. So later that day after dinner I asked what was going on. We took a walk and then she said she wanted to break up. She didn't had explanation. She just wanted to be single. 
I was devastated, didn't see it coming. I was high up there and suddenly everything was pulled away underneath me. Most of you will probably know how it's feels to be dumped without knowing it was coming. 
I asked her if there was someone else. She promised there wasn't, but off course there was. There was this guy is her class I hadn't heard a lot about him, but I knew who he was. I found out because she was still logged in on my pc and saw all her recent chats. 
Again the trust in someone completely shattered. But I was still head over heels. So I kept trying. 4 months later we started dating again, but there was no trust. I doubted everything she would say I didnt believe a word she would say. 
Its hard to life like this. And I've seen some dark sides of my self that I hope never have to see again. This lasted almost a year then she wanted to go to her father in South Africa. And that's when I said we should break up. This isn't going to work. At this time it was mutual, but trust didn't restore. 

A year later I got a girlfriend again  it was fun at all, but I believe I wasn't in love with her. 

After a while my oldest sister would drop her contact what she had with our mom. She didn't want to hear anything about it anymore. To be honest, I don't know what the last straw was. I do remember her arguing in the car, and me waiting on the outside till she was done. 

My connection to my mother is nihil. Almost absent, she never apologized to me personally and never asks why I never call or something. It's like she's not bothered by the fact that she feel like an aunt or even a distant relative. When the divorce happened there was this big drama about money possession and such. 
My dad was crazy enough to pay for her motorcycle license. I don't know ow anymore why this happens, but it did. My mother didn't want to help my dad with keeping the household running. He was paying the mortgage on its own and even provided everything for me. He could barely come around. The hard part for me was that she didn't want the help my dad, knowing he was providing for me. That's how much I'm worth to my mother I guess. The though nothing more. This one stings, and is one that keeps on getting back. 

When I broke up with my second girlfriend one of my friends hurt me like damn hard. I was close to him, he was a very good friend of my. I losend a little bit. Did talk a bit about my parents, just barley. When his birthday came around he didn't invite me to come over or anything. Apparently was the brother of my ex more important he got to go, I had to hear from someone else. I'd expected that he'd atleast let me know, but nothing. After I asked he said that I would maybe had a hard time with it. Him not even asking was kinda a slap in my face and I left it at that. I'm not saying this is his fault but this adds up to the pile of things I can't seem to process. Now you might think this isnt that big of a deal, but only having 4 real friends, missing one is hard. 

And soon enough after graduating the other friends faded as well. The current count is 1 and I don't anyway how I can get that number up anymore. 

Work is the only positive in my life though. I'm good at it. Colleagues look up to me and it comes easy to me. There is also this one colleague. I was very close with her. Told here some dark thoughts. She seemed to listen, so at one point I tried. I tried to reach out but it didn't work. I told her I'm in a hole and can't get out. I told her the I don't see anything positive about even being here. She listened and listened. Afterwards she said  what about this other colleague? Can't you talk with him also? And didn't hear anything from her for a few weeks. Not even the question, jeez how are you doing? Are you as OK as that smile your putting on? This really hurts because I was kinda hoping we could have been friends. But all that I'm for her is a colleague, and never will be more. 
This time I reached out, it took so much energy. Months after it happened I 'woke up' again. Can't recall any that happened in that period. I know that I was done and decided I needed a change. 
I decided I'd go to China for a few weeks, went there, and life felt great. I was able to make friends. To myself I looked social again. For a few week my dark side could near me. 
I was sleeping in hostels and contact with people was so easy and fun to do. But this only lasted as long as my vacation lasted. Getting back was hard, after just a week I felt down again. Seeing her at work reminded me of everything I wanted but wasn't able to. The next month's are not recorded again. I was asleep. 

When I traveled to China I stopped in dubai. Here I met a girl. We met trough Tinder(I know right). But she is amazing. She always is there for me and really helped me out quite some times. The only bad thing, she isn't close. I can't just go to her, which in many many cases I wish I could. 

This not recording or sleeping is something is hard to explain. I don't know when I'm a sleep. I do know when I'm awake. When I'm awake if always feel like I want it to change. These are also the times I talk alot with the girl from dubai. I like to think she really understands me. She close enough I can open up, but lives far away, so I'm less scared she would breake my trust.

By now you might think, you had 4 friends 2 faded, one ended, where is this last friend in all of this. Why is he one of persons you talk to when you're awake, how comes he doesn't know. Well it's simple, for one he's to close. I don't need to show my trust if I don't let him see anything is wrong. Don't get me wrong, I'm greatfull he is my friend, but I don't want to put trust in something I'm not sure off. He has this believe that state of mind is fully controlled by your self, if you don't want to feel it you'll not feel it and there won't be it. Take sadness for example, if you don't want to feel sad you'll not be sad if you don't let it. Quite strong character you can say, but it also makes that he has less feel for empathy. He won't ask because he doesn't wants to seround himself with bad feelings. And I belive he would see a cry out for help for what it really is. Can't blame him, I would steer away as well if I knew what was coming I guess. 

So by now you'll probably think that this isn't this hard and they are just things I need to process or just let it be because I can't influence anything of it. Maybe you're right, but try to see through my perspective. I'm having a serious trust issue and I'm withholding my self of being social with any one new, so it's kinda hard to process it on my own. 

So I talked about the whole social part. This is one of the things om not anymore. I feel like since I graduated I can't converse with anyone new. I find it hard to come up with questions to ask. It's hard because it always feels I'm not interesting enough for the other person. Plus it always feels my common knowledge is going as far as the most of them. Maybe this varies per location, or group of persons. I don't feel like this with my best friend, I do feel like it when someone new gets introduced to me or with anyone at work. The only one who doesn't bring up that feeling is the colleague I've spoken off before. 

The only thing that is left behind are my thoughts. My thoughts and I have been locked up with each other for quite some time now. And they do collide every now and then. Sometimes my thoughts wants everything to stop. And not just the thinking but just everything. Feeling nothing, being nothing. And the only nothing I know, is something I don't want. I still believe that there is something to stay for. My thoughts just think otherwise. ",4
"My partner was diagnosed today with depression, he's been prescribed Fluoxetine and counselling. He started the anti-drepessants today and tonight we had a stupid fight.  It started over nothing, a silly insult to me and I walked away from him, then he got SO angry about that he spat out some really harsh words and currently I'm lying in bed and he's in the spare room. 
Background: we never fight, and he's never slept apart from me like this. I don't know if this is some sort of drug reaction or maybe he just has built up anger over today diagnoses?... but we've never gone to bed with unsolved issues, let alone over something so silly. 
I don't know how to deal with this

"Let me start off by saying that I wasn't always this way.  I used to be an advanced student in elementary school and had a passion for reading and learning; I could absorb knowledge and I had a social life. Then, things took a drastic change in 5th grade for no obvious reason.  I suddenly felt tired all the time; as if I didn't sleep enough.  All I could think was ""why am I so tired? I'll sleep more tonight"" every day.  For the first time in my life, I failed a test.  I broke down in tears in the middle of class and was surrounded in anxiety and depression.  I also somehow ""obtained"" adhd/extreme forgetfulness and started losing my ability to properly comprehend people speaking to me and use my mind's eye to visualize anything...  I was uninhibited in many social situations (my best friend's mom thought I was using drugs before I even knew what a marijuana was) and extremely anxious in others.  Stimulants didn't help much besides giving me energy and although anti-depressants help with my mood, all the other symptoms remain.  I have a feeling that this is a brain tumor or brain damage because of how it affects me so broadly.  I've never had suicidal thoughts and honestly, I don't think too much at all.  Nothing crisp, anyways.  I'm 19 now and not sure where to proceed from here.  My mom believes it's because I became an atheist and my dad thinks it's because I just don't care. Professionals (doctors, therapists, psychiatrists) don't seem to know what's going on with me.  My thyroid and bloodwork is fine and I got a sleep study done.  Should I see a neurologist or another specialist? ",2
"Like right now. Just sitting here back in my home town during the holidays. Still fighting wicked depression and anxiety, and having to fly back across country in two weeks. 

Just sitting here alone at the kitchen table listening to some Linkin Park style music, sipping on a Stella and I realized how often I get caught in this daze and how I almost enjoy it. 

Like I'm allowing the pain in. Soaking in it. The music obviously amplifies it. 

I think about the decisions I've made that have caused me greater pain. More stress. 

I think about what my future holds. If I can make it until then.

I think about the present. If I'm meeting everyone's standards that they all know of me.

Think, think and more thinking. Sometimes mixed with tears. Sometimes angers. But always with self loathing.

Then I go to bed. Sometimes feeling better. Sometimes worse. It's a wicked, and vicious fucking cycle.

I'm so tired. Speaking in general of course about life.

"I play on Playstation. The only friends I felt I'm actually close to (save 2/3 people at my school) are on Playstation. I hinted yesterday that I'm feeling down and made a few depression jokes etc. And they passed it off as me âgoing through an edgy phaseâ. Afterwards the two calling me an edgy teen left until it was me and my closest friend online. He asks if I'm depressed shortly after the other 2 leave. I tell him everything. He isn't the first person I told, (1 of the previously mentioned school friends was the first) but he confesses to me that he knows how I feel, and that he self harmed for about a month of his life. I was shocked. I didn't know what to say. I guess know I kind of admire him for getting over it and going through it. I'm scared to tell anyone else. I have suicidal thoughts and tendencies, I feel unmotivated and can't get to sleep. I also usually can't get out of bed in the morning. I am too scared to kill myself but I wish I could just die in an accident. I wish there was an easy way to cope with it or beat it but there isn't. I feel like I'm the only one apart from previously mentioned friend that's going through with it in my area. I guess when I go back to school the fake smile will have to fool everyone all over again.

"Does anyone else struggle around this time of year? I find myself fluctuating massively from being optimistic and determined to make positive changes, to feeling totally hopeless and unmotivated to do anything. 

I was dumped out of the blue in the beginning of November, and whilst it took it's toll on me at the time I felt like I could push through. By December I really was ok. But now the new year has come around and i've gone back to the usual routine of work, eat, sleep, repeat, I feel more lonely, useless and unlovable than ever before, convincing myself that 2017 is going to be awful. I wish there was a way I could just permanently stay in the positive moments where everything seems to have purpose and promise, but it seems as soon as I start feeling ok, I tumble backwards and feel worse than ever again :(

The problem is I've been fighting like hell to keep myself out of depression after losing my grandfather in October. She's been drunk since she got here (she drank a shit ton before we picked her up) and has been saying pretty mean things. I know she's drunk and over emotional right now, but I feel like an idiot for taking on the responsibility of helping her when I'm not even in the right mindset myself. She went on for a half hour about how it was pointless to try to better yourself because youre just going to end up getting old and dying and all I could do was sit there in silence because I literally couldn't come up with anything to counter it.

"My therapist tried to introduce a breathing method to reduce anxiety, which I am sure works. For real normal people. He was saying things like ""If you breathe when you are stressed you'll be able to feel happier and less afraid"" ""But I don't really think I feel any emotions other than fear..."" ""Well my job isn't to make you happy, it's to help you deal with your anxiety"". ""But I don't feel those emotions...that won't help me..."" Useless. They don't understand or care.

"I'm a 20 year-old female. I've been having depression for the last 5 years, with a peak in my 15-16. I used to cut myself, but then my parents found out about it and, seeing their horrified expression and how they handled it, I promised not to do it again. They helped me out though. I finished college and got into university, but still I was pretty depressed and had a few guys in my romantic life. Last year I met this wonderful guy who is my actual boyfriend. He's loving, caring, sweet and very in love with me. I couldn't really ask for more: i have a family, I'm pretty good at uni, have a boyfriend and everything. But still, my demons keep haunting me. I know it sounds horrible to say, but I really wish I was dead. I don't know, I see the bad in everything: i hate myself, i don't like my body even though many boys told me i'm beautiful, i wanna cut again, i hate how i am, my voice, my hands, my legs, my hair, my shyness, my behaviuor, my life. But I can't take it away, since this many people love me.. And I feel bad just by imagining how harsh it'd be for them to know about my death.
I can't cope with these thoughts that seem only to get stronger lately, I feel it even more when I'm stressed and the minimum stupid bad thing that happens or that is said to me makes me suicidal. Like really, I'd really want to jump off somewhere really high.
I can't go to a psychiatrist, since I hate being a burden to anyone. My parents, at the time, suggested me to go to a psychologist, but i didn't want to, because I feel like a burden (economically too) and my mum would have taken every chance to face it to me (like: wow, here talks the crazy girl). So yeah. I seriously don't know what to do, talking about it to someone isn't a good idea to me since my boyfriend thinks I'm out of this, my best friend is now seeing a girl and likes her and i don't wanna ruin it, and then I don't have any other friends. i think I wouldn't wanna talk to anyone in any case actually.

"Attention: I didn't expect this to be so long, but I guess I had to let myself go and just write how I'm feeling, I'm sorry if I'm wasting your time... It's a mess, I know, (the paragraph organization) but anyways, enjoy what I wrote about how I feel, I guess...

Hi, again here, yeah... M18. So, yeah, I think I'm going crazy... I ran out of my medicine about 5 days ago or so... I've been on it for a month. Felt really out of myself honestly... Wasn't sad, but I wasn't happy either. Something like a zombie? Did some research... Depersonalization... 

Oh well, I stopped taking it not because I wanted to, but because my psychiatrist doesn't give refills unless you go and see him personally so he can see you, understandable, except the fact that I have to pay $40 for each appointment? Plus the medicine... Yeah... I don't know about that... 

Anyways, I've been feeling weird... I don't know. I've been competitive all my life, and nothing has been working for me these past days. Used to play video games, I'm pretty good at them, now I suck, and I do play regularly, I just can't play well. I like to do BMX... I'm having troubles doing tricks I normally do... I'm getting very frustrated and I honestly think of jumping out of my balcony... But, sadly, I can't kill myself... So, again, I don't know! Oh man...

 I've been smoking cannabis these past months, tried it once and, well, I don't really have friends, I mean, I consider them as friends but when your friends has depression, has been in a 72-hour watch, and other bunch of stuff, you should be worried right? Not them... Sad, sad, sad... (For me). But yeah, again, I don't think the cannabis is making me go crazy just because I smoke only before going to sleep and I just take about 5 hits from a one-hitter I have, which I would say is about, maybe like, 0.2g each time I hit it? Maybe even less actually, but yeah, that's the amount.

Oh man, this is getting really long, looks like a story haha... But yeah, I'm bored, nothing seems to be fun anymore, I don't feel like doing anything, but I feel like I'm wasting my time, which feels bad... 

That's how I feel, I think... So, I don't know... I guess I'll have to pay $40 to my psychiatrist to get my medicine again so I don't get suicidal thoughts again and I actually kill myself... Hope everyone's having a good day I guess?

"Hey everyone. Still horribly depressed here. Lately I've been lurking subreddits and searching the internet on ways to improve my situation (something I spend a lot of my time doing, likely to the point of counterproductivity), and I can't help but feel terrible after doing so. 
        
My main problems are things many of you are also probably familiar with; i'm depressed, have a rock-bottom self esteem, have suicidal thoughts, ect. The issue I have that trumps (and is likely the cause of) all the others is that I'm socially awkward and suffer from social anxiety. 

I have terrible social and emotional issues. Honestly, this makes me feel like I generally suck as a person, and mixed with depression, is objectively true.  Worst part is, I'm 21, an age where the vast majority of people have either already toppled these kind of issues in adolescence or were successful enough in being people that they never experienced them. But me? I'm fucking lost. Well, not lost necessarily, but hopeless? I know what I need to do to become confident, stable, likable, successful in my endeavors. Problem is, when I see how much work I have to put in to actually become a decent person, realize the sheer gravity of the change that has to take place for me to be the person I want to be and the literal year(s) it might take, I start to wonder if it's really worth it. 

I have no friends. Let me go a step further and say I have no real human connections.  This is not because of other people. It is because of me. Who I am fundamentally as a person, the result of my life and culmination of my personal reactions to my life's events. I have never been confident and social, and thus have never known what it's like to truly live. Twenty one years of never truly living is twenty one years wasted, and I don't know if I can go on. There are so, so many things about me that need fixing. I have to work relentlessly to reverse the damaged/incongruent person I've become. The thing is, most people don't have to worry about any of this shit. Even a lot of depressed people have friends, significant others, and get over their ailment with relative ease. Me? I can't even fucking have a conversation with someone. I don't know if I'll ever be the person I want to be, or grow to love the person I already am; It would take too much time and effort to do either.

"I'm exhausted, I have been for years. If I'm not exhausted it's because I'm running on adrenaline.

For years I've been trying, I try at work, I try with my friends &amp; I try when I'm on my own. It's exhausting trying with little progress, often regressing back to a state of depression.

I'm so tired of people getting bored of me, sometimes it takes a week, sometimes a month, sometimes a year. Eventually everyone gets bored (and the few who aren't bored of me, they are always so busy). Don't get me wrong, I do have a bunch of brilliant friends, who are fantastic to hang out with. I do genuinely believe they enjoy my company, but when I'm down and want to talk to them they don't want to know. They push me away when I need them most.

I really want a long hug, not just a quick one to say hello or goodbye. Even better to snuggle up in front of a movie with someone and just for an hour or so feel embraced and less broken.

And yet I constantly feel detached from all of this, I get moments where I feel like I am inside this body but not connected to it. I feel distant from all those around me.

"hi. 

i had another account somewhere but i forgot the login to it, haha. but that's okay. i just wanted to check in, as a sort of outlet for myself since i don't really get the chance ever to just put my thoughts out there. 

it's the new year. happy 2018, by the way. i hope you all achieve what you wish. i spent the eve alone - by choice. i'm 18 years old, and i'm home on winter break currently from my first semester of college. i haven't really spent time with anybody since being back, though. i have my parents and two older brothers. my parents - we don't necessarily have the best relationship but it's not a bad one either. it's kind of just a mutual understanding of boundaries. i give them what they want and they don't intrude on my personal life kind of deal - you know? and my brothers, they're 11+ years older than i am. and it's not like they don't like spending time with me, it's just...they never really make themselves available for me to reach out.

my oldest brother called me minutes after the clock struck 12 to wish me a happy new year and he asked me what i was doing. and i said nothing, of course and he just told me that i could've called them. which was a nice sentiment in theory but i don't know how to reach out to someone that's never really been reachable. 

i guess right now i'm just feeling lonely. and i've realized that i've been feeling this way for a while now. i don't have anyone to talk to. and the people that i thought i did, my friends, are becoming less my friends and more so people who need/want me by convenience. i don't have anyone. but i guess that's nothing new, i just thought things had changed. and that i was living a better life in college.

speaking of, tuition sucks. when i was still in high school, everyone was just like ""nooo you'll get money to pay for school, don't worry! they practically just give money out for students to go."" or ""apply to scholarships! apply, apply, apply!"" like two opposite ends of the spectrum. but no one really walks you through any sorts of processes that you need to go through in order to pay for college. they kinda just throw it at you. i mean, thankfully i managed to get it sorted out. but too bad i had to figure it out on my own. and eventually, i'll have to pay out all these loans on my own too haha. 

i love going to college, it's fun and i feel like i can be a different person there. a more confident, self-assured one. but if i don't figure out all this money, i won't be able to go. my parents haven't really paid a single lick towards my schooling, but they want me to go to school. my mom even took $500 out of my account to use for something else. i mean, she asked to take it out but who am i to say no to my own mother? 

i'm considering just calling it quits after this next semester and maybe just go to community college for a bit then transfer? work a job at the same time too to save up. but then to me, it'll just be like i put in all that work to get myself into a nice school only to drop out. all my effort. gone. i don't know. it just always seems like there's a wall in my way whenever i just want something for myself. 

i have a lot to do. a lot of decisions to make. a lot of people to please. but a lot of people who will never be satisfied. because what i do is never good enough as i always fall short, even though i put all i have and more for those who need me.

It's just... this is who I was ten years ago, and it's going to be who I am twenty years from now.

I didn't have a problem taking the meds but (and I know this sounds bad) but in my own mind they were a crutch. When I felt better I just wanted to leave that part of my life behind and remembering to take them pulls me back into that headspace 

Is the negative thoughts and anxiety part of the withdrawal symptoms or is it me slipping back into my old way of thinking",3
"The next sorry excuse for a piece of shit that says that suicide is a ""permanent solution to a temporary problem"" might just get taken along with me. It's not one problem, or two problems, or three problems I'm dealing with: I am besieged by problems. Every fucking where I look I'm inundated with them. Problems I have no solutions for and have run dry on ideas.
I can't help but think of wartime. If everything you know of the enemy is that they have no mercy, that they are ruthless, and that they will do nothing but torture you, and you find yourself surrounded by them, history shows us that people in such a situation would often choose to take their own life rather than suffer such a fate. 
Back to us, today. A permanent solution to all of my problems sounds pretty fucking nice. If you could find a way out of such a situation, I believe you would have found a working cure for over 80% of suicide. Until then, you can cram your platitudes up your fucking ass.",3
I felt so bad through the day. It has been a while since my depression and anxiety have been this bad. I thought i was over all this mess. Today it came back. I couldnt move all i could do is cry. I feel extremely lonely and had suicidal thoughts all day. I know that i wont do such a thing but the thought is not going anywhere. What should i do? I cant talk this openly with anyone. There is one person who i can talk about my depression and anxiety but i cant reach him. Is there any chance that someone is reading?,4

It's the kind that you feel in the pit of your stomach, like you're going into an exam you're not prepared for. It makes eating out really unpleasant too. I don't know what it is. It's like I feel really vulnerable when I eat and I'll often feel sick even though I haven't eaten that much. Does anyone else get this? How do you deal with it?",3

More so a voice in my head that sounds very familiar to me father's that just tears me down from the inside out when I get down, and then I feel like that me being down all the time is gonna fuck up things with my fiance, she loves me and helps me a ton but I feel like I'm a burden on her and I don't like any of this. I know this is just a rough patch and that things will get better but right now it's hard for me to see that and I just needed to unload thus jumbled mess of thoughts off my chest.

"I'm new to reddit as of today. Recently, my depression has been super bad and I've been hoping for some other support besides the usual ""but your life seems to be going well"" and ""dont be to hard on yourself"" that I get from my parents.

The few people ive talked to about it tell me that I have no reason to be sad because Im super high in my class rank, get high grades, got into a college with some big scholarships, and have been first chair hornist in my school band (or they say im just stressed out, which i am, but its just adding to my depression and making me feel even worse). Truth is, I have never really fit in or connected with anyone at school, leaving me with many shallow friendships and no one I feel I can trust. Work isnt any better either. Minimum wage for a shitty retail job and the only coworker who i got close to and who could understand me refuses to talk to me now for literally no reason given. Hell, im only 17 and I already feel stuck in an endless cycle of anger and disappointment that im going to be in stuck in for 2017 and the rest of my fucking life.

I'm living with my family again until I get better but I am at such a low right now. I don't know what to do with my time. Nothing feels like it matters or will bring me anything.

For few years i have thought that i'm just really unlucky.

My longest friendship has been only one year and finding or even getting friends is an everyday strugle for me.

It is the thought of thinking that the world would have plenty of problems gone if i wouldn't be alive.

I have a feeling that everyone just hates me. And i should just find my tree and apologize to it for wasting its selfmade air.

My personality moto is ""whatever i own or have touched or is really important to me, is getting ruined, broken or lost""

Today i destroyed so many things without even knowing it and i just thought

What if i crossed the street and a car would ride over me

What if the building sudenly would lose balance and just broke over my head

What if i would slip and crack my head open

What if...


I'm too scared to atempt suicide but i still wanna die... i want it to be an accident 

The thought of death is scary itself but at the same time angelic to me

The only person who i think would give a damn about my life is my best friend

The only person who understands me and listens to me

The only person who can make me smile even if it is the hardest day

Not my mom or dad, i don't even have siblings, but my best friend....


I always thought that the every second possible accident anywhere where i stand is just messed up brain and now i think it's depression.


And I am the only one who knows because i hide beneath a girl with realy colorful hair and a lots of smiles.

THATS NOT ME",5

___________________________________________________________

I've felt like total garbage emotionally/mentally (and physically) since around May of this year. I think what I'm feeling is a midlife crisis. I felt like my twenties were never going to end and when it hit me that they were about to, I felt a tremendous sense of time running out and started realizing some terrible truths. First, I'm in the exact same place I was when I was 20 in spite of many failed efforts to fix that. I started seeing signs of aging all of a sudden. But what really did me in was finally landing a full-time job and being ecstatic thinking that I could finally afford to live on my own and be independent instead of continuing to live with my lunatic parents. Then it hit me that I wouldn't even be able to afford to share rent with multiple roommates even on a full-time salary and that realization just broke me. I haven't recovered.

When I would fall into a depression before, I knew it would pass and I just waited it out. However, all these age-related things hitting me at once and feeling like I'm so far behind my peers and feeling like a colossal failure, it's the first time in my life that I've ever felt like I wouldn't be okay. For a while, my life was okay with moments of feeling awful. Now, feeling awful is the norm with fleeting moments of being okay.

Sometimes it's an overnight change. I'll be depressed for a week - crying every single day, that crushing feeling you get in your chest when you feel your worst, wanting nothing more than to die, researching suicide methods, etc. Then for a day or two, I'll be closer to normal or maybe even a little happy. Then something will set me off (like making a minor mistake, or sometimes nothing at all triggers it) and I fall right back down into that hole and become miserable again. I just feel like life will never get any better and I don't really want to stick around to see how much worse everything is going to get. I was freaking out so badly back in the summer that I gave myself godawful muscle pain in my back and ribs that was mistaken for a pulmonary embolism and I was sent to the ER. A $1500 hospital bill to pay when I make $10 an hour didn't really help me to feel better about my financial position.

Is it normal for depression to do this? To come in waves, but never truly get better? Or do I not even know how to be depressed correctly and I'm just being a crybaby and having a bunch of consecutive adult tantrums? I've lost my desire to do pretty much all my hobbies at this point and when I try to pick them back up, I just find them to be frustrating instead of enjoyable. I just think I'm good and truly done with everything, and knowing I'm too much of a wuss to actually kill myself just compounds those feelings of hopelessness.",5
"It isnt because i am told the whole time im playing games to kill myself. It is because i used to think that I dont need friends i have plenty on the internet. I have lost most of those ""friends"" that i had when i said that but now i only have 2 or 3 and i am lonely and wish that i would just die but i cant bring myself to do it.",4
"Hello I'm having a particularly difficult time right now, i feel bad for asking because I know some people have it so much worse than me but I just really need some encouragement from another human being right now. Or someone to play video games with and just talk to. I've spent the last 3 days in bed doing nothing and I feel disgusting. I just want to talk to a person.",0
"I was diagnosed with mild depression which then got worse and I've been on sertraline since August 02 of 2016 (50mg) and recently switched up to 100mg. I really thought this would help with my depression, but so far I feel like shit. I've been depressed since March of 2014, I'm not sure what triggered it but it slowly crept up in a few months into 2014. On March 19th, my computer was caught by malicious software and I don't know why but it sent me over the edge - I couldn't function, I stared into space and I felt so dead inside. I spent months meticulously removing myself from everything from the internet, keeping core programs and user accounts fro some things, but over those years I cried and my family got sick of me quickly. For context, before my trigger, I had friends that I had met online and became good friends with. We spent days chatting and telling jokes, and I didn't care what anyone else thought of me. I was quick to retort if someone angered me...but now I just feel so empty inside. And I just left them. I removed all trace of myself from our chats, I upset them and I upset myself. I spent months processing what was happening to me. 

In fact, I spent my birthday removing my old skype account and removing people from it. Since then, I've over compensated for what my brain considered 'a failure in social ability' and now I try so damn hard to try and fit in. My anxiety sky rocketed - if I think something rude or harmful about someone? I have to literally walk backwards and tell myself that this wasn't going to happen and that I needed to shut the fuck up. And then I kept walking on.


I used to love videogames too. I recently purchased Battlefield 1 (50% off, hoo boy) and I was always fascinated by war, and they dids a good job. But I'm always examining things..for example, I feel like very business is out to get your money (which in fairness, they are) but I feel like it is malicious attempt to undermine me.
I always look at things and people and go 'Oh! I wonder what their next attempt to screw me over will be?'
I have one friend at the moment. All my other friends bailed on me as soon as we went our separate educational ways - I went to college, they didn't. And they talked about me behind my back, even those who did attend college with me did this, and I was so fed up with these to faced spiteful shitlords that I called friends.
But now nothing makes me happy - I shrugged at Overwatch (its cool, and something I try to play, but I just feel like I'm not good enough, and that this games is meaningless in real life.) And I just can't play games. I haven't got the attention for it - I can spend 20 minutes watching a youtube video before I have to move on. I have the Skyrim Special Edition on PC, and I really want to play it, but I feel so alone when I do try. I can't immerse myself, I feel way to aware of the real world, and that I should be doing something productive with myself rather than waste my time on a 'videogame', but then I hate everything outside. I hate businessmen, I hate self entitled people, I hate false people, and I don't know what to do!


I like buying stuff. And this is nearly self destructive as I find myself broke all the time, and I buy stuff I don't necessarily need, but randomly crave. I really want to save for a movie authentic Stormtrooper helmet from EFX though. (They are very cool.)

Sometimes I think to myself 'ignorance is bliss' and I want to be someone who doesn't have to be so aware, and I know it sounds super snotty, but I feel like sometimes I'm too smart to be happy; I'm shitty at Mathematics, but I did well in English literature and I like to tinker with electronics. But sometimes I think about things that I don't believe most people my age (16 by the way) will do anytime soon - I like thinking about philosophers and I've been meaning to reads Sun Zhu's 'Art of War' but I know I won't actually do it.
Sometimes I feel like the things I do (act smart, own a bible because it looks cool, act grumpy and mysterious) is because I want to impress. I want people to feel sympathy for me because I'm a 'broken figure' with a 'dark past' and a hidden vulnerability that I am all to careless to talk about.


I've never had a girlfriend. I've been close and I've been close to people, but I don't think I could stick it out - opening myself up to another person, show how weak and vile I really am. This affects me in my daily life too - I have a thing for Daisy Ridley (as do 99.9998% of men on planet earth) and I'm sat there like 'man, how cool would it be if me and Daisy were a thing! Y'know, long walks on the beach!) and stuff like that. I know its a tad creepy but I'm 16 and my hormones are wack out of shape.


I've had suicidual thoughts, but not really enough to make me want to go further. I overdosed on sertraline once, (however, I wouldn't call 200mg of meds as opposed to one 50mg anm 'overdose'.) But everyone was so angry at me.
I was once kicked out of my house in May (29th) 2016. I took a sleeping bag and a warm jumper and ran to the church near my house, and I stood on a wall and watched people walk by. I phoned a friend (who recently bailed on me) and he invited me to stay for the night. (No one has ever done this for me, and maybe never will again, and I tried so hard to make this friendship work but ultimately failed.)
I also argue with my family so much that sometimes I feel like a sociopath has taken over my body - a snarling beast of a man whose intent is to exert power and rule this small house. And I snarl and laugh at the people I live with. And I don't hate it. I feel justified sometimes, and I've been called a 'sociopath and psychopath + countless more by own mother.. But I don't blame her, we are very alike and I would do the same. My siblings have told me to kill myself multiple times between them and called me a 'monster'.


For exercise context, everyone says 'aww yeah, do some exercise, you'll feel better.' (Yes I know about endorphins) and for more context, I am a certified 1st degree Black Belt Taekwondo Martial Artist from April of 2015. (Nearly 2 years now, jeez...) I used to love running, but now I'm a little more porky.
My dad has never lived with us. He left just after I was born, but I see him sometimes. He bought me my first motorbike in 2016. It was consequently stolen. And I wasn't angry. I felt nothing.
In my family, my great uncle (lets call him Uncle Bob) killed himself. it's not something I should talk about, but when its something I consider on the daily, I don't think an old memory is a large price to pay (yes I'm an asshat.) I know this is pretentious of me, but I've felt like jumping out of my window so many times. Thats it. Done. Game over.

I also have a problem with meaning, or should I say I have a problem with believing in one - I'm a self called nihilist, and can't help but believe the world was created as a freak accident, and we are just a byproduct, that there is no God, that we all die and are forgotten. It is pretty cliche, but I identify quite easily with Rick from Rick and Morty and Greg House from House M.D. (Everyone says they do too, I know.) Also, I really want a cane. For walking. At 16. My mum says it would be embarrassing, but my legs are usually terrible and a cane wouldn't be merely cosmetic for me, I think it would help (Should I get one? :/)
I just feel like shit all the time. And suicide wouldn't be difficult for me to do, it's just I don't really want to. I'm in limbo.
Help me please.",3
And it's pissing me off. Am I ugly? No one's ever said I was. Am I boring? My therapist doesn't think so. Am I scary? No one even looks at me. Am I unremarkable? I'm tall. So *why?* What makes me so different from everyone else? ,0
"Yesterday it was the 31st. My aunt's birthday. She is 70 years old.

I used the last bit of my money to buy her pizza, wings, and fries. You know, to treat her. I even massaged her back. I offered to do other stuff for her should she need it, like I always do.

Do you know what happened in the end? She stormed out of my apartment, screaming at me about how much she hates me for ""envying"" her. She randomly brought up topics of the past. Some of which aren't true, such as her saying I abused my cousin back when he lived near me. I've treated her to so much in the past few months, and I thought such a nice gesture would make her happy. I guess not.

""If this is my last day on Earth, good, because now you know the truth.""

An actual quote from her.

Yesterday, on the 31st, I tried to be a good person. I was left crying in my bedroom instead. Now it's 2018. And things look bleak. My boyfriend recently broke up with me. During my relationship with him, I was the happiest I have been in a long time, perhaps ever. I had 0 suicidal thoughts while in that relationship. Now it feels like he's ignoring me despite wanting to just ""be friends"".

Anyone could read this, even people I know, but I don't care. I don't care about anything anymore. I'm left wanting to die constantly. Anything is better than continuing to live this life I live. I just don't care anymore. I don't matter. I'm useless. My own mother is mentally unstable, and now I am too. I inherited it. The conditions I grew up in made me who I am now. I can't get a job. I can't get money. I can't be happy.

No matter how hard I try, I can't be happy.

I don't want it to be 2018. I wish I could just go back in time and fix everything instead.",4
I've felt like a social outcast for as long as I can remember. I've always felt like everyone else is constantly running around going to parties and hanging out with each other. [This article](https://www.bustle.com/p/how-social-media-fomo-affects-your-wellbeing-7510145) that showed up on the front page helps me feel a lot better. Maybe I'm not actually a social outcast.

"I'm not visiting a therapist for 10 years and have to take heave medication everyday. I haven't been in a war and had a friend die in my arms. I'm not a homeless, heavy drug addict.

It's like today everyone is depressed. I don't want anyone to believe that i'm just some person trying to get attention or be a stereotype. For me life is hell but i know that there is a person that has it worse. But for me my problems are obviously the worst thing but... I dunno. I'm not worth that. 

A lot of shit happened to me, many stuff i don't even know exactly anymore because all i did my whole life is try to suppress it all to the point that i have no idea who i am anymore. I now i'm not normal but at the same time i feel like i'm not ""worth"" being called depressed or something. I'm just stuck between life and time with no where to turn to and not a goddamn clue what i am or what i'm allowed to be. There is no end and i can't even tell where i belong to. It's like i'm stuck in a tiny, tiny hole and i can barely breath.

"On the last day of 2017 I've decided that 2018 will either be my make or break year. 2017 has been a shit show. Not too different from previous years but this one just takes the cake. Literally the most disappointing,heartbreaking year ever. Too painful to even write out here, I just want to forget.  Sometimes the only way i can sleep is thinking about dying. Sometimes i hope that i just wont wake up at all. There was a light at the end of the tunnel towards the end of the year but once I started to become happy it, of course, all cam crashing down. Ironically, once i tried to become closer to God and be a better person it all went to hell. I hate being depressed. I want this to be the last new years I spend crying and miserable. So I'm making this post,for myself, to come back to it on december 31 2018. I want to remember exactly where i am, crying in bed after getting off of a late Saturday night shift. Sad about ""him"". It's 5 am. You just took a double dose of melatonin followed by a few gulps of Nyquil just to try and get through the night. This time next year I want to be in a better place. Academically, spiritually, relationship wise. I want to be happy. If not I might just have to give up.

"These boards are riddled with self contempt and self loathing, which is naturally what you might expect on depression boards. Im not condemning anyone for expressing the pain they are dealing with, but why are there never posts or replies with constructive, helpful advice on how to move forward and make progress towards combatting this illness. The few that are posted are overlooked and ignored in favor of discussing symptoms. Someone posts on here that they often feel like killing themselves and they get a myriad of posts from people who just tell them they also feel that way. The poster feels support knowing there are other people out there just like them, but what use or aid is there in this overall? It is probably more harmful than helpful. I've been a long time lurker on these forums, also suffering myself, and I see that many people feel support and solidarity with those suffering here. Yet I can't help but feel that we are all dragging each other down. You don't cure a disease  by just communing with others who have the disease and complaining about your symptoms. You make small incremental changes towards wellness to get better, and I never see any suggestions on this subreddit for people to do that.",5
"Okay so this is the story of how I had everything a 19 year could possibly want and how I lost it just as fast. I had everything. I had a loyal gf, I had a good paying job, a car, had lots of friends who I considered ""brothers"", I had a good relationship with my mom and sisters, I was going out every weekend having fun. Everything was perfect. I had never been so happy in my life. I was saving up for a newer car, for college, I was planning lots of great things for myself. I thought maybe I had finally gotten into the right track. I started hanging out with the wrong people though. I knew it was wrong but I didn't think I would ever get caught. We would go out at night and go through people's cars , steal whatever was valuable, credit cards, wallets, purses, electronics, guns, whatever we thought we could get money for. I was going on $1000 shopping sprees. One night I went out by myself and got caught. I was arrested, put in jail for 3 days and then I bonded out. My bond was $13,500 for 5 counts of felony entering auto, and 1 count of prowling. That's when my life flipped upside down. I know i put myself in that situation. I don't blame anyone else. Suddenly I had nothing. My friends I considered ""brothers"" didn't ever call to check up, they weren't even worried. So I had no friends now. No car. No money. (I hired a decent lawyer but she charged $4000). I lost my job in which I had just gotten a raise . I got a new one but it's a job I hate for less the money I was making back then. All my money goes to my lawyer, rent, and bills. I haven't bought myself anything in over 4 months. I'm not a citizen of the United States so if my lawyer can't drop find a way to drop the charges then I'm going to get deported back to Colombia where I was born. I haven't been there in 15 years since I was 4. So now I had the stress of not even knowing if I was going to be able to stay in the country with my mom and 4 sisters. If I was going to be able to stay with my girlfriend. I had no way of seeing her because I didn't have a car, no money to take her out, no friends to go out with. So I started pushing her away, avoiding texts, avoiding calls, avoiding chances to meet up. I knew how much she loved me, she was head over heels, I've never seen someone love me so much. But I didn't want her to fall more and then me get deported. That would have crushed her. So I continued pushing her away, every argument I would suggest breaking up. So one day I just did it , I broke up with her. Blocked her on all social media. I miss her tho but she is already talking to someone else. Now that I'm trying to meet new people I can't seem to be genuinely interested in. What they tell me about them and about their lives. I want to care. But I just don't. I want to be social, and active and positive and all these good things but I just can't. It's always in the back of my head. A little voice telling me, what's the point of getting to know them, what's the point of texting them back ? You're going to get deported in a couple months anyways. I talk to a girl for 1-2 days and then I stop talking to them all together . I don't even find joy in things that I used to love, like soccer , I tell myself what's the point in going. To go play if you're gonna get deported in a couple months. I want to be able to live productively , positively, I want to just live but this court case is holding me back. The thought of this impending doom in holding me back and I'm letting life pass in front of me. Idk what to do. ",1

Sorry if I seem like I'm just dumping a lot here, I just feel I need help thinking through some issues. 

The big thing is a pretty damaging vicious cycle. I'm awful depressed because I'm lonely and feel I'm the only guy my age (22) who hasn't dated anyone, or even had any close friends I could trust and talk to. Never really hung out with anyone. Though I wish to change that and make a few friends in college, but not only do I not know how to go about it even though it's my third year, but I just feel that nobody would care about me. In fact, everyone from high school completely forgot about me, even before graduation, and we're a small class and everyone knows everyone's name. 

There's a lot of things that drift through my mind when I try to work through this, and I just get overwhelmed.  

A number of things leave me feeling worthless about myself.  

I happen to be mildly autistic, which honestly I don't understand much about it, but in school, word spread about it and plenty of people started talking to me as though I was retarded, even a few that knew I was just like any of them. I should be able to just get over that, but... you can only wonder if people are telling you that you're intelligent and capable out of pity so many times before you start getting paranoid.  

Plus, I see tons of other people who seem to have good friends they're always hanging out with, but I never know how to introduce myself to someone, honestly I'm scared I'll make an ass of myself. Enough that I literally get paralyzed when I try to talk to someone, my jaw seizes up and everything. But I'm ok with people approaching me, which never seems to happen, it's only happened once in my life. This makes me think, is the easier problem to fix that I struggle starting conversations, or that nobody wants to talk to me? 

I've got pretty bad image issues, too... I know that it's almost impossible to find a guy who'll say it, but there it is. I won't say I'm a heavy guy, because I don't look particularly bulky, but I... look up gynecomastia and you got me. I look like I've got boobs, and yes I'm a man and *hell* no, I'm not trans. I've been trying to work out and loose them, but while I've been loosing some weight they're not really being affected. I'll never look good in a tee shirt like this, it seems, and that's kinda why I'm struggling to start an athletic lifestyle... again, vicious cycle I gotta break out of. 

Lots of things to work through here... I feel absolutely overwhelmed. ",1
"Hi all.
This is my first post on reddit even though I've used it for quite a long time and I haven't even made a single comment, either. The reason for that is because I've got severe cyber anxiety (scientifically discovered yet or not). Despite having many ideas and experiences to share online, the fear of being attacked, mocked, insulted or looked down prevents me every time. Like many of people here, I've also got social anxiety and depression, accompanied with a naturally boring personality, which make it nearly impossible for me to make friends and maintain relationship. In my secondary and high school, I used to have a number of close friends who valued me, wished me a happy birthday every year and even gave me small birthday presents but not anymore since I went to college and suffered from depression for the first time. I didn't contact them anymore so they probably thought I lost interest in them and let me go too, while it was just my depression which kept me from maintaining relationship in my life. Throughout these years, I've only got groupwork mates, fake friends (been bullied and stabbed in the back by them) and some regular acquaintances, all of whom don't care to be my close friends inspite of my kindness and will to be friends with them. Yesterday was my birthday and I planned to turn the internet off that day because I didn't want to stare at the truth that no one would care about me, no one would wish me a happy birthday although they all got notification of it on SNS. Today, I turned on the internet trying to trick myself that today was just another regular day, no birthday ever happened in order to hurt less but it was in vain. Like previous years, no notifications of any birthday wishes from anyone, even one college friend who treats me quite well (but he probably doesn't consider me a worthy friend, which I've felt so far).
I'm not the type to show my misfortune and vulnerability to anyone beside my parents because I'm really scared to be laughed at or attacked, it took me much of my courage to share it here for I couldn't keep it in my chest any longer. I didn't intend to make it this long at first. I have longed for someone's empathy even if it comes from a stranger on the internet because I need to feel that I'm still connected with the world, to feel that someone still considers me a human being with the need of being cared for, not an unworthy person for anyone to give a sht like I've been. Although I have wanted to take my life and nearly attempted to do it many times, I couldn't do it because I've still got my parents who love me. Maybe in the future after they've left me, I might do it but not now, so I need a reason to keep going.",4
"So many of you like me are alone for new years, and I just wanted to say I hope that 2017 improves for you all massively. You guys deserve happiness as does everyone else.

Most of my adult life I can't seem to hold down a full time job. I can't seem to focus at all and i find it difficult staying in work.

I was put on adderall when I was younger, because i talked my way into an ADD diagnosis even though I know it was due tp my social withdrawal and depression that I just had no motivation. I became an asshole to the few friends I had left. And now I have  one friend left. I really have no motivation and feel hopeless. Im 18 and ive been like this since I was around 12.

My family constantly make jokes about me and say that I look retarded and ugly, etc. And I honestly just make jokes about it but it really effects me. I guess I just need to talk to someone as I've reached another new low. My friends don't really talk to me too much anymore, but give me confidence at the same time.

"I'm 20, and a sophomore in college. I struggled with depression in high school, but thought I got over it for the most part. When I'm at college and surrounded by friends, I feel great. But the second I am alone in my dorm, I feel like shit. 

And now that I'm on winter break, that feeling is magnified. I don't know if it's anxiety or depression or a mix of both, but I just feel like trash and I don't want to exist (no worries though; I'd be posting this on r/suicidewatch if i thought I was actually considering acting on that feeling.) I am sad. I don't have friends at home really, and I guess this has me all wondering, am I just predisposed to being sad? Like if I'm only happy when I'm busy and with other people, then is my natural state of being just being a pile of shit? 

And does anyone else ever feel this way? I'm good as long as I'm distracted I guess. But when I'm on break, all I do is lay in bed and fuck around with the computer or video games. I have nothing to do or think about, so the things I end up thinking about are all negative. I don't hate myself or anything; I'm just sad and don't really wanna be (be as in exist, not as in ""don't wanna be sad,"" i now see how the syntax there mighta been confusing) (though ideally i wouldn't be sad either) (lastly feel like i gotta say it one more time: seriously am not gonna kill myself.

"I have had suicidal thoughts almost every day since I was around nine years old. I have been on a few different types of anti depressants:
Zoloft
Effexor 
Celexa
Trazodone (mostly for sleep but paired with Effexor)

I don't understand why I have these thoughts. I have acted on them in the past and obviously I survived. Sometimes I have them when my mood is really bad and things are really hard. Thoughts are like: it would be easier if I just ended this. I'm tired of living.

Other thoughts happen when I am generally rather happy or even excited. The thoughts are more like: yes this is nice, but life honestly feels so monotonous or pointless. It'd be better if I died. I don't have a purpose here. I get in the way. These people don't actually care about me. I'm too much trouble and I am a burden. They would be a lot happier not having to deal with me. I should just kill myself. It would have been better if I had died last time I tried.

And other times it's very random. Such as when I'm driving. They bother me a lot and I was recently told it wasn't normal to have thoughts like this. I used to think everyone would think things like this from time to time, but I was told that they don't and it disturbed me.

My moods are difficult to handle at times. I feel like I'm all over the place. Sometimes I'm doing very well and feel pretty confident about things. I set goals. But when it crashes, I feel miserable and I quit eating, bathing, and generally just taking care of things. It's like looking through someone else's eyes. Like what I'm doing doesn't matter and I don't know why I'm bothering to do it. 

I haven't ever told anyone the real extent of my suicidal thoughts. No one knows I have them almost daily. When I told an individual I had them, she believed it was only in that moment and a couple of times. 

I wanted some advice. The thoughts scare me. Right now I wouldn't act on them. But I have tried a couple of times- as a teenager and once at 21 that I still don't know how I lived from and thankful I did. I was not hospitalized. Did it alone and stayed alone for about a week afterwards. I don't want to ever find myself at that point again and I think I need to tell somebody, but the thoughts make me feel insane or like a bother. ",3
"I'm a 21 year old girl who has been in and out of therapy, on and off drugs since I was about 10 years old.

I'm currently on holiday with some friends in new york and I decided not to go with them out to dinner for new years eve because I just don't have any energy to deal with things anymore.

I've hated myself my whole life, and I've tried killing myself multiple times... I just want to take a break from all the shit that goes on in my head.

Not sure why I'm posting thing really, I made a post on /r/suicidewatch earlier, but I guess with it being almost new years, I have no one to talk to right now, and I can't stop crying and wishing I wasn't forced into this world.",4
"Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I've only now understood the fact that I've socially isolated myself over the last 5 years.  Growing up I played premier soccer on one of the best teams in my state, but quit when I was 15 after making the academy team, a decision I've come to regret. I remained athletic and played for less competitive teams afterward just to have fun with friends and help them improve their play.  By senior year in highschool, I had dropped all athletics and after school clubs.  I didn't have my drivers license or a car, so I mostly stayed at home at night.  During school I ignore my long time friends with the excuse of getting ahead on homework, but when I got home all I would do is play video games, watch random documentaries on youtube, research random shit, try to write stories, and a bunch of other random things that never amounted to anything.
I graduated with no friends.

After highschool I went to college and immediately connected with my roommates.  I became really good friends with one of them that I later seperated from because he did not like partaking in smoking weed, even though he was accepting of it, I distanced myself because I didn't want to involve him in it.  But this indirectly lost me my best friend in college.  I never went out to parties that the frats through, I'd always give some BS excuse not to go, partly because I was scared of getting an underage drinking infraction and losing my license, partly because I didn't want to socialize.  Despite me turning down every party request, I'd still smoke with my friends in small groups, but large parties just made me so anxious.  As time went on, I slowly started seperating from those friends though as well because I kept turning down their invites, not just to parties but to do anything.  It became a repeat of highschool, but it started in my second year rather than my senior year.
I dropped out of college.

College wasn't making me happy, my intended major was biochem (which really interests me even to this day), but the loads of work, lack of friends, and helplessness got me.  I would spend most of my nights crying myself to sleep locked in my dorm room feeling helpless and had nobody to consult.  My grades started slipping once my depressive episodes started lasting whole days at a time where I wouldn't even leave my room to shower or eat, I just kept myself busy playing video games or staring at my wall.  At this point in time I started smoking again to try to help bring myself out of it, but it became too much of a crutch.  I was smoking a little over a quarter ounce every 3-4 days (about 80 USD, 7-10 blunts worth for those who don't smoke).
This is why i dropped out of college, because I didn't want to waste the money until I fixed myself.

This is when my social isolation started.  I had no remaining friends from highschool I kept in touch with, and lost all of my college friends because I would just ignore their messages and say ""Sorry man i got ur message too late"" or ""Sorry man I'm busy tonight with (insert bullshit excuse)"".  Luckily I've gotten my depression under somewhat better control, although there are times where I still can't control them or recenter myself.  But really what it's done is make me feel inadequate.  After months of thinking about it, I think the root of it is that I have nothing fulfilling in life.  I think since I quite soccer, I've never had anything to immerse myself with, I can't find that thing to get me up in the mornings.  I literally snooze my alarm for 1-2 hours a day because I hate waking up...

I guess what I'm really asking is how do I find fulfillment in a life where I feel inadequate at everything I do.  Coupled with that, I've seem to become very socially anxious.

Some other stuff to include to give you guys a full picture, I work as a cashier.  Almost every one of customers loves me because I have such a cheery attitude (I think the reason I'm ok with this is because the conversations i have are familiar, almost routine).  I am the kind of guy to give you the shirt off my back if it'll help u, but wont take a handout if I'm starving.

I have plans to hike the Appalachian Trail (full thru-hike) once i pay off my remaining student debt because I thought that it would help me more than anything to just bring my life back to the basics, food and shelter.  The only activity I do is hiking really, even that I do alone and now that it's winter it's much more uncomfortable.

Any advice is welcome.  Thank you~",5
"I just spent three years not really feeling love and compassion as much. It has caused me to isolate and feel shame, and I haven't reached out to people who once meant very much to me.

"I was in acute care for a week last month and I'm looking at going somewhere for a longer term stay. Unfortunately the state I live in doesn't have ANY residential care for my age group and if I'm going to have to go to another state then I'm going to go somewhere that I'll enjoy at least.

I realize that you can go to a mental facility in New Jersey if you live in New York, that's simply a state line. I'm more curious to know if I lived in say, Georgia, if I could go somewhere in say, California or if that's frowned upon.

"Hey. I've never been diagnosed with anything so I don't know if I'm supposed to post here, but I couldn't really think of any other place. 

What am I supposed to do about my worth? I feel as if everything I try is a failure and I convince myself of that fact. I can't handle any criticism because it consumes my entire mind and destroys any confidence I had to do something. I'm now finding it impossible to do any schoolwork because I've decided that no matter what I do I'm going to fail. 

I have no intimacy in my life and that makes me feel like I'm not good enough around my peers. It kills any confidence I have around people so I just try to avoid any social situations.

I know these thoughts are unhealthy but I can't even force myself to try to get better.

"I always feared people's judgement.  I never wanted to be known as the weird one or the outsider.  I always kept to myself.  No one really bothered me, but no one really cared for me either.  I was in the middle, not bad enough to be hated, not good enough to be loved.  I was content with this position for a while, but it was lonely.  I would always sit at home, while others would go out and actually do things with friends.  I would lament my existence, and question if I was ever good enough.  The truth is I am afraid to just be who I am around people.

I have seen how people treat others who are different.  They can be mean and cruel.  Their avoidance can hurt and damage, and their ridicule can cut and bruise.  I have been on the receiving end of cruelty, and I would rather not go in depth about it.  People don't accept me now, even as docile and non-aggressive as I am, so how would they accept me if I was myself?  I worry they would think I am weird and annoying, even though I don't mean to be at all.  I just want to be accepted and appreciated as I am, but I worry people won't agree with that.",4
"I just, I wish admitting I lost everything would help me heal, because of delusional, naive, immature, greedy, selfish, entitled, privileged feelings. 

I'm still making awful mistakes..like I haven't learned anything. 

but I just, I can't accept everything that has happened without crumbling completely. 

I am still doing exactly the same things over and over again because I'm an idiot. because I can't just decide to do different. because I'm weak and broken. 

nature can be cruel. why should it be any different? Why should I expect any different? if I want to ignore the rules of society, then am I no better than an animal? should I be treated like on?

I'm just miserable and there is a sickening certainty I have about things only getting worse. 

I'm crying out to people who can't help me. I feel like I'm screaming into a void. I feel helpless and broken and weak and ignored and worthless. 

why did my life have to turn into this. I made mistakes yes. but like this? this is what I deserve? wishing to die in my sleep because I find no joy in life, no passion, nothing to pursue or take interest in. I haven't committed suicide over these last 6 years, fighting the urge on a weekly basis at the least, because my family doesn't deserve to experience that pain. 

was I such a terrible person to deserve this? or do I continue to see all these little choices as things that don't matter, when they are exactly what should be of most importance. 

I'm just going to rot away. I'm sorry I can't do better. I signed up big time and I can't recover from it. I'm always going to be stuck with this deep regret that I should have done differently. that I should have been smarter or more careful. 

but no. I just, took a huge risk, and lost just about everything. I don't recognize myself anymore. I don't feel like myself. I feel like being hurt so much has fundamentally changed me, and I feel like I just don't have the ability to wait it out through small steps and hard work. 

I always worked hard. always. now I'm tired. I worked so hard just to throw it all away. I worked so hard to build the beginning of a good life just to get distracted by something shinier, and now nothing is as shiny as that thing, not even that thing itself. it's gone.. I have nothing left to look forward to. I'm broken and I'm miserable and I just wish the torture would end, one way or another. I can't take it anymore. I can't take these feelings, these regrets. I can't keep making excuses and trying to convince myself into something to make it seem less awful feeling. I can't even begin to convey the amount of pain this loss has caused. I can't stop feeling like I'm going to lose more unless I accept what I've already lost, be an adult and stop whining over things that can't be changed. 

I just, I've never let this stuff out. I've never taken down the delusion and stared my grief in the face. and sometimes I'm so numb from the pain that I don't even know what I'm missing. because it felt that way then, and it still feels the same. something important is missing from my life.

I've been dealing with some deep seeded issues involving music, my self image and creative-side. The last few months of 2016, I've nearly stopped most recording and writing cause the anxiety of trying to present it online or in person overwhelms me. 

Looking towards the new year, I've decided to do things I wouldn't normally do, an open mic last night with a friend and I felt so out of place. And tonight I tried to record a vocal at home and just couldn't get my head into it. I almost sent my microphone through my computer screen. And the kicker, I had a conversation with an industry friend and he is like 'follow your passion', keep writing and recording and I keep texting. 

I doesn't make me feel good, why should I follow it if it makes me crazy. I have a great job and it's given me time to think on life and money and where I wanna end up and I feel that at 26 I've been force-fed this crap about following your passion and it will lead to happiness when all it's led to social anxiety, perfectionism, lack of trust, depression and envy. Why can't everyone just let everyone figure out everything in their own time, why is it the modern way to make everyone rush and feel guilty that we have nothing or not doing enough.

I'm mentally exhausted from trying to figure out the whole thing and I don't think it's worth it anymore. The best part is that I keep asking for help and nobody seems to have any ideas or wants to help. Maybe I'm naive about that. Too many bad things about it all.",3

Deep down, however, I feel like in the long run it doesn't mean anything. I don't know what the goal of life is but it's not to be happy. Not for me at least.

I would love to feel empathy again. I miss it. No matter how hard I try, I can't feel it. It's like I have become immune to it.

"I am almost certain that my depression is caused by all the bullshit of all shapes and sizes going through my mind ALL.THE.TIME.

Today I will be sharing one of them:thinking way too far,WAAY TOO FAR...

It usually starts by me thinking about the good things that will be happening to me in the near future,like,eating out with my family,but the problem is...I always think,""what's after that?""
It goes like this

my stupid ass asking:well,what's after that dinner?
brain that i desperetely want to amputate:well,you will go to sleep,and experience the misery of worrying about the future,as always

my stupid ass asking:well,what happens when i finally get my shit together?

brain that i desperetely want to amputate:well,you will experience the misery and stress of going to a good middle school and the overwhelming amount of homework.
my stupid ass asking:well,what if I graduate with a degree after the misery?

brain that i desperetely want to amputate:You may get a well paying job,but your parents are still going to die anyway,have fun.
my stupid ass asking:well,after getting a well paying job,what if i manage to achieve my life goals?
brain that i desperetely want to amputate:your parents are still dead anyway,and you still have to go through the misery of reflecting on all the memories with her and crying your ass off,and after achieving your goal,you will have nothing to do,and just sit there and die,i guess.

This is where my brain goes to sleep,and I reflect of my thoughts,and think further,as I am a dumbass.

me:Well,what if I die?

me to me:you will either be rencarniated,or experience infinate blackness,wait,you are dead!oh yeah,since you do not have a sence of perspective anymore,time will theretically go infinatily fast and the universe will just die of heat death,and even if you rencarniate,there is a 99.9969% that you will become something of no value,like a gnat,or a housefly,and even if you become human again,you will have another chance to experience the misery of feeling dead,depression,and 20+ years of education,and also die on the inside seeing our society collapse right before your eyes,and also,the memories of your awesome parents will also be gone,or you will spawn in a test tube,and you will be a subject for science experiments.

Has anyone had an experience of this? 

I feel so bad though. My Mum is putting up with a lot with me and doesn't deserve the shouting, smashing and me crying all the time. She deserves better than the way I am treating her. ",5
I am struggling so much. The only things now that keeps me going is seeing my mum so determine to be happy or try to be happy. I need to get better for her,4
"Hi all.

Not sure this is the right place for this; I submitted it on r/suicidewatch but there's so many threads on there I fear I won't get any replies.  I need some help and i'm scared to call a suicide hotline for fear of them staging an intervention or some such thing.

This is a first for me -- I've had moments in my life where i've felt close to the edge but things have been really hard recently.

I'll cut to the chase here.

Three years ago I suffered a workplace accident and broke my L3-l4 vertebrae, in addition to my hip. I sustained mid back complications as well that have caused heavy spasms and contusions. I've been fighting workers' comp for all three of these years to get treatment. I got my spine fused two years ago and my hip a little less than a year ago -- while things are better, to the extent that I can walk and such, I live in constant pain and discomfort. I still need to ice my lower and middle back constantly. I recently successfully applied and got invited to my dream job in the Peace Corps, but when I got to medical clearance they told me I couldn't handle the job. This has left me devastated. I thought I could beat this thing through sheer force of will, but my plans have crumbled to nothing and I don't know what to do.

Moreover, I was molested at a Christian summer camp when I was 11 years old and i have never been able to move past it. It has completely impaired my ability to form emotional attachments and even to perform sexually -- not necessarily all the time, but enough that i have blown every chance I've had at romantic normality or happiness. I fear it's messed me up beyond repair.

I am now 25 and tottering under the weight of these burdens. While in the past i've had an active and enjoyable social life and great/varied friends, a mixture of chronic pain and my own personality defects led to me having a very lonely ahd depressing New Year's -- a massive contrast from only a year ago, when I had a pretty damn good time.

The holiday isn't the cause, of course -- it's more just the catalyst to underlying issues I can't seem to beat.

I am lonely. I am in pain. I want desperately to live a normal life but I no longer believe it is possible.

Is there anyone out there who has beaten something like this? What the hell do I do? Where do I turn? How do I overcome this? Is it even worth it? I just want it all to stop.

I would appreciate any advice. I really would. I need 2018 to be different, and I fear it will not be.",1
"2015 was the exact same as 2016. 2014 was the exact same as 2013. I feel like I'm in fucking limbo and I am invisible. I never get invited for things on new years. Also, nothing ever changes. Nothing in my life changes each year. I feel like I meet with the same people, do the same things, eat the same things, never get luck with romance, etc. It's all a waste of fucking time! 

Why waste time to celebrate the same year with the same shit as the last. I never get out of the same places, people, and situations. It's all the same. I hate it. The only thing I enjoy is getting drunk on the new years and that's it. I'm only 19 and I feel like nothing will change in my life. My life will probably be the same when I'm 30 years fucking old. Nothing exciting. Every girl rejects me that I like. Every guy rejects me that I like. No romance. Nothing. Well, good night.

I hope you all had a great new years and I hope you all have a great year. I don't my own year cause I know it will be the same.",5
"I hate staying at University accommodation. I haven't made any real friends and I constantly feel homesick.

I'm not severely depressed, it's more of prolonged mild depression so I think I have Dysthymia. Can't be certain though because I haven't spoken to a professional yet.

Every morning I wake up dreading the thought of going into work, spending 6 hours walking around a shop floor, only to end up with another 7/8 hours left until I sleep again.

There's only so much I can do in the day and it doesn't help that I procrastinate. I have exams soon and I haven't even started revising. I hate myself for being so lazy and idiotic.

I just want to be at home. Or somewhere where I am surrounded my family and people I like. People who are on the same wavelength as me, who share my interests and have stuff in common.

I have numerous days were I am happy but then I just get back home and feel so depressed because it was a one-off.

Sometimes I just have these thoughts where I think that death would get rid of everything. Sometimes I wonder if anyone would care if I died. Though I don't want to carry out these thoughts, but these thoughts are often.

I just don't want to be alone anymore, and I don't know what to do.",2

I try reaching out for help but when i do, they just make it about themselves and how selfish I am. I have an appointment tomorrow for a psychological evaluation and i am really nervous. Yes i have been diagnosed before and have taken medication. But i was already getting off most of them. And now im falling down again. I just want to get better. I want to feel genuinely happy. ",5

"I've always had depression, and it's gotten really bad this year. It's affecting every aspect of my life, I've pushed most of my friends away, barely been talking to my family, my finances are a mess, and worst of all, my performance at work has gotten really bad. My boss is very hands off, so no one knew how behind I had gotten, what a mess I'd made of my work. Well last week I got a kidney stone and had to be out several days, and when I was gone they discovered how bad I was doing. Ugh.   
   
Now, Tuesday first thing in the morning I have a meeting with my boss and HER boss called âdiscussion about performanceâ and I think it's extremely likely I get fired. Even though I find it REALLY hard to talk about, I'm considering just being totally honest and talking to them about my depression, and how much it's eacallated this year. Let them know that it's not just my work that has suffered, but my finances, soicial life, family life, health, everything. I'm not trying to use it as an excuse, it's just the truth. I don't know that it will save my job, but at this point I don't know what else to do.   
   
Has anyone ever done this. What do you think? Any advice? I'm so scared of losing my job and just spiraling further and further down.",2
"For my most of my life I wanted to be a musician. My best friend and I were in a band together and we were building something.  However, as I entered my mid-20s and entered a serious relationship, I felt competing priorities and wanted to potentially pursue career paths that had more stability and less time away for things like touring. 

Since then, I've been locked in paralysis for over a year about I should be doing with my life. I feel a lot of regret about leaving the music path, yet don't feel confident enough to rejoin it either. Similarly, I feel hopeless attempting to commit myself to another path that will make me fulfilled. 

The more I think about things and analyze them, the more my brain takes me down a dangerous path of regret, anxiety, and despair. 

Any words of encouragement of solidarity would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",2
"I feel like depression and anger are linked, and I'm poorly dealing with both.

At my worst, I feel like I want to fight or insult others, which is obviously not the way to go. I've harbored grudges, though I'm not sure if that's related to depression or something else.

I've heard meditating is a good thing to try. Just haven't had the motivation to try yet.

"I know it is probably stupid to ask this, but I feel like there is no use going out anywhere without anyone to enjoy it with. Is there anything I can enjoy doing alone? I am always stuck in my room all day and I hate it so much. I feel like I'm wasting my life away. I don't want my 20s to go by and have nothing to talk about. What's even worse about staying in my room for long periods of time is that I'm stuck with my thoughts. No matter what I do on the internet to distract me, there will always be something that triggers my sad thoughts .. and then make me cry for 15 minutes straight. I would like to go one day.. just one day of productiveness and no crying.

"I've had literal months to finish these two assignments for college (UK college, I'm 17, doing a fashion design course) and I've barely started due to a mixture of depressed feelings and fear of getting the work wrong and being thought of as an idiot. I was given an extension for one of them which was due before the christmas holidays but my tutor gave me until we go back for the new term, which is tomorrow. I haven't touched my sketchbook for the whole christmas holiday and I hate myself. I don't know if it was *because* it was christmas or if it just happened but I have felt like utter shit for the past few weeks. Maybe its because I'm falling behind in my work, but all I want to do is kill myself most of the time and that's not an exaggeration at all. 

I have two assignments due tomorrow, one that I've had an extension on already for the same reason, and I have to go in and explain why I haven't completed it again. I'm literally shitting myself about having to ask for more special treatment because of my fucking head not working properly. Plus I don't know how he'll react, like what if he says its fine but secretly thinks I'm just milking it to get more time for my work? What if he believes me but decides I'm not mentally capable of staying on the course? Not to mention the huge fear I have that he'll just blow up at me, which I highly doubt is going to happen because he's a very nice person, but I still worry about stuff like that.

"I want to help my papa, who suffers from obvious depression.

He had a pretty tough life: loosing his mother when he was young, my grandfather made him drop out of high school to start working and earn money to leave in the house. He worked from 16 to 45 years.

He had a meaningful job where he met my mom, who left the company a few weeks after starting dating him. At some point he was ""promoted"" but not really, and left the job shortly after.

Long story short: he popped from job to job until 45 yo, and have been unemployed since. My mom works and earn enough money to feed us (although some months this becomes an issue), but her job takes her away from the family for like 2 weeks straight sometimes, which obviously she hates.

At 55, and unemployed for 10 years, my dad feels depressed and guilty for not being able to give my family a better life. He tries really hard to look like he is ok, but he is depressed like noone I've ever seen.

I can't do much by myself since im in college and haven't found a job yet. My brother has, but he prefers to take his SO in vacations.

"I was diagnosed with depression about 5 years ago and got prescribed prozac by my doctor at the time.  About a month after taking it, I felt really self-loathing and just worse in general, instead of better.  It got to the point where I nearly made an attempt on my life and got taken to the emergency room where they confiscated the medication off me.

Some time went by and I decided to go back again, this time they referred me for therapy, but the waiting list went on for a year and I still heard nothing (I'm in UK where NHS have free services, I couldn't afford private counselling).

The last time I went was about 2 months ago where they offered me medication again.  I decided to tell them I wasn't very keen on the idea of taking anti-depressants due to what happened before, and I also mentioned that I waited a year for therapy but it never fell through, and they said something among the lines of ""we're not sure what to do then"".

"Well, fuck you! To be alone in the crowds better than to be alone (to be left, to not try for the other, but not to choose loneliness), to be better than to be with people who do not understand you; as if it had to be with those people. If they do not understand you, then go, go the fuck away, come along, be like me. What is holding you? I tell you what it is that scares you; to live my lonely life in the pile of meat surrounding you. It 's not hard to be alone, believe me, you just need to be yourself. It is very insincere when you stay in that crowd and whine about staying in that crowd and praise my loneliness. Fuck you one more time.

I am not sincere too. Sometimes I wanna get in between that rotten, stinky pile of meat you've stayed in between and feel safe. I can not live loneliness properly. 

To be alone is like a suicidal person stays between death and life. Those who dreaming death, those who see death as salvation, those who want to die think about that because their hope is fading. But the hope that has been left in his pocket allows him to continue for a while. There are also similar hopes in the people that alone. The lonely people waits for someone, wants to find someone. As long as you remain alone you will lose hope, knowing someone, having the ability to communicate with someone. The prospects of getting rid of loneliness are weak as long they are alone.

The only person who is obsessed with death is the only one who has a chance to get away from loneliness and to survive as long as he has spent time there. The ability to survive. It has not been too long.

sorry for my english. it is not my first language and i've learned it myself, so it's not good, bad actually... whatever, i hope you'll understand what i meant.

"I have been struggling with depression for the past 4 years. I am a freshman in college and am currently the happiest I have been in an extremely long time. I have been dating my girlfriend for 2 months now and I have built many strong friendships at school. I felt like I was finally ready to tell my dad about what I'm going through and why high school was so hrs for me and why it has been nearly impossible for me to mend our relationship.

I believe that one of the leading causes of my depression is the family environment that I spent my high school years in. My dad worked two full time jobs because he wanted to leave corporate America so he started a business. Every day he would come home around 10 extremely stressed and irritable. Because him and my mom wanted the best for me they were extremely strict with their expectations grades. Every night would be screaming while I stared at them blankly telling them what they wanted to hear.

When I think back to 8th grade through junior year, it's nearly impossible to remember anything but yelling. I was scared to tell them that I was depressed because my mom is extremely protective and caring and sweet and she would do everything in her power to help me. But I don't want their help. I've stopped cutting and thoughts of suicide are few and far between.

A couple weeks ago I found out that one of my good friends tried to kill themselves. When I was talking to my dad about it he said that he just didn't understand depression and how someone could have depression but nothing to be depressed about. This made me want to share my thoughts and feelings with him even less.

Something my dad shared with me is what completely changed my outlook on everything . He shared with me that his greatest fear in life was losing his connection with me and our relationship completely withering away. I believed that the only way I could get better is if I shared with him what is going on.

After telling him about my depression a few days ago he told me that if my mom found out she definitely would not let me go back to school so she could keep an eye on me. So I'm not sure what to do with this situation. 

I'm sorry if this post doesn't belong here. I just needed to release everything from my mind and write it down somewhere someone could hopefully see it. Other than my girlfriend I have no one to share with. Thank you for reading.",2

"This is my first post to a subreddit so forgive me if I fuck something up. I am going to keep personal info vauge incase someone I know ends up here. So here it goes. From a young age I always knew I had things worse when compared to others around me whether it be financial situation or relationships but in the past couple of years I really found how different I was. My dad was abusive to my mother, they split when I was 2 however I do know my father but he isn't a father in the traditional sense. I randomly see him every few years and I am like ""Oh hi dad"" then he is like ""hi son"" and boom, that's it fast forward 4 years and rinse and repeat. I was never really fond of any of my family, I despise one of my siblings  because he is a fucking scumbag and really dislike my mother because of her stupidity and ignorance and shitty attitude toward me. I have a meh relationship with the rest of my family. When I younger I was really interested in video games, I never had any friends, not a single one, due to lack of similar interests and the location of where I live. Fast forward years later and my situation has only changed negatively, from the years of being locked away in my room, I have developed extreme social anxiety (not officially diagnosed but I know the symptoms when I see them) and have only fallen into a deep state of sadness, dunno if it is depression. My social anxiety is horrible, I shit myself when needing to get a haircut or go to a store. My school is bad too, I talk to people but they are not my friends, I pretend they are so I don't look like a complete fucking loner. I have never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl either and I am not even a bad looking guy.  My only actual friend is someone I met on a game 4 years ago. We talk everyday. Which is even more sad. I am beyond petrified of turning 18, because once I do, my mother will make me get a job, or I will live on the streets. I am scared to get a buy something in a store, how the fuck am I getting a job. Just the pass summer, I didn't leave my house once, there was no reason to, I have no friends to go out to. I stayed in my house for 3 months and never left once. My current situation is I stay in my room wasting away with every passing day. And I only become more and more sad as the days go by. About a year ago I have finally come to terms with the fact that I am going to end my life before I turn 18. I feel no reason to live on, I will not fair well in adult hood anyway. I know a lot of people are just going to pass this off as another bullshit post where the author dosent actually die and lives on happily ever after, this isn't that story. I will be dead within a year, period. Nothing will change my decision to end my life. I plan to hang myself with a belt that will be wedged between my door. I will not leave a note, I wouldn't give my mother the pleasure of reassurance to why I did it,  she dosent deserve it. These aren't my only reasons why I want to die. One small one would be the fact that baldness is big in my family history, so even if I get my stuff figured out, I still have balding to look forward to. A big reason as to why I am going to end my life is the curiosity of an after life, I am not religious so I don't beileve in anything specific, but god damn I am jelous of the dead, they know what comes next. Worst case scenario, its nothingness which still sounds better than my life. So yeah thats it, feel free to ask me any questions while I live the last 8 months of my life.",2

"I am so lonely that its depressing me. I've been lonely for my whole life and I never really noticed it but around August of 2016 I got put in a team for a teamwork project I had for uni. There I met this girl and we started chatting. It was wonderful. We were basically inseparable. We were sending selfies and stuff and chatting all the time almost every day. We met irl(she lives in another town) and we both had loads of fun. 

This continued for some time and then something happened... She stopped chatting to me like we used to. She told me that she had some problems and stuff. We still chat but I really dont know how to describe it. Our conversations dont last as much as they used to and dont happen that often in general. I really got attached to her. And I really like her. But too shy to tell her how I really feel. 

She showed me what it feels like not be lonely and I really miss that feeling. I have almost no friends its only her and one childhood friend.

And now I am sitting alone at home. Everyday is the same thing. I sit at home in bed and sometimes go on my computer. And this repetitiveness of my life is really depressing me. I dont have a job yet. I will be at home for the rest of January.  I dont know how I can do anything productive when there is a massive hole in me. And some might say why dont I just go out and socialize. Well its not that easy for me. I am a very shy person and its tough for me to talk to somebody. I am just awkward. 

I just dont want a lonely boring life. 

I know that others have it worse. I wrote this just to share my story and hopefully feel better by doing so.

"Ive recently had the alpha stim bought for me by a parent. Its a device which clips electrical nodes to your head, stimulating the brain to activate parts of it which may be inactive or overactive due to depression. Been using it a couple of months now and have improved greatly. I can slip back into depressive thoughts but its not as constant as before. Was just wondering if anyone else has used the alpha stim and if they have did longer use of it eradicate their depression completely?",3

"All that I've been able to feel is beginning to turn into feeling nothingness. Even when depressed there are still ups and downs but now I am starting to just feel nothing. Blandness. Stale. Everything devoid of any meaning really at all. I'm not suicidal and I don't self-harm. There's just no motivation to accomplish anything and I can't really see the point of anything. I find myself staring at things and thinking about nothing, whereas my mind used to spend a lot of time thinking about everything. Does anyone else feel like this? Sometimes, like now, I realize it's happening and it makes me feel worse to know it's happening but sometimes it really doesn't even bother me because sometimes feeling nothing can be better than feeling anything, ya know? I don't know.",5

I've been like this before but being in the UK mental health services are absolutely dire so I was just told 'what do you have to be so depressed for? You have everything to live for!' and stuck on a waiting list for therapy which I waited 6 months for and it was totally pointless. This time I won't even bother turning to anyone for help. I can't stand being around my husband because he asks if I'm ok every 5 minutes when I just want to scream at him to leave me alone. I can't stand being around my kid because she does my head in and I have zero patience for her. It's neither of their fault, it's all me, I don't deserve them. I am a waste of space and oxygen.",5

I don't even feel anything anymore besides the occasional crippling sadness/loneliness. I binge and I don't feel anything anymore. I buy things and I don't feel anything anymore. I've been struggling and working so hard to change and nothing has changed. I honestly can't keep living like this, and I can't keep living if I will never be happy. I don't know how to be happy.

I had been feeling ok after I got a job and even better when I would play music, but I've lost my spark. I'm so tired and angry, I can't find the upside anymore.

My grades were slightly below average, so that didn't help as much. I know my situation before and now isn't your fault at all, but my whole experience with you was just terrible. I tried to look at the brighter side of things before. So, from what I've learned:

They were at a bday party and after she hung up I got like 20 different messages from her friends who were at the party bullying me. Saying that I'm a faggot, need to man up, crybaby faking depression, that they are a better couple etc etc. Made me realise that people are evil.",4

"Hello Reddit depression, I wonder if sometimes anybody else feels like this is the only channel that they have to communicate with other people honestly. I mean Reddit in general not just the sub Reddit depression.  I post a lot on Reddit and I post about a lot of things that are personal to me that concern me and then have a large impact on my feelings. I have been diagnosed with generalized depression and anxiety. I am not suicidal but I feel like lately I am very apathetic about life in general. And while I don't really have a bunch of positive messages to spew Into The Ether I know that there are reasons to continue on. I know that the New Year can bring a lot of Hope to some people but can also bring a lot of dread and negativity to some also. So I'm going to ask you what are some things that you are not looking forward to in the upcoming year? I am not looking forward to continuing to be a very supportive and caring partner to somebody that isn't very good at expressing their appreciation or acknowledgement of it. That is not to say that they are a bad person. It is just that sometimes things get hectic and it is hard to see all of the little thing that somebody does for you to make your life easier. So seriously what are some things that you are worried or anxious about for the upcoming year? What do you hope that you can do better? Or what are you hoping that other people can do for you? Are you hoping for something?",5

I've reached a point where I REALLY don't want to continue and I feel ready to leave it all behind. I know it's selfish to transfer my problems and I really don't want to do that to the few people I care about but isn't it selfish to ask me to continue living when I'm in so much pain?

Firstly, I rear-ended someone hard enough to total my mother's car (it was still completely drivable but FUCK ME, right Geico? :); this happened the 19th.

Then, I got a rental. And took my girlfriend of two years out to dinner on NYE, because that's our anniversary date. Silly me. Someone t-boned my rental car at 55-60 mph and completely destroyed both cars. Thank the fucking lord no one involved sustained any serious injuries, but me and my girlfriend are in pain and quite frankly, while I'm glad she's alive and ultimately okay, I wish I was dead.

I'm on the hook for some serious fucking cash right now. I don't want to do this but I know I have to. For everyone else I've just been putting aside my fear and pain and anguish and self-doubt and I've been putting it into my work, finding extra hours and working for bonus etc. Hopefully I'll find a way out of this.

Sorry for rambling. I don't want to tell this to anyone else. They just won't listen because both the accidents were my fault, so maybe I really am just a shit driver despite an otherwise squeaky-clean driving record of four years.

I have for awhile had this weird thing were I separate my concious and subconscious and end up conversing with myself. I don't always agree with myself thow and sometimes contradict myself in weird ways. my subconscious will be scared but I won't be scared. that doesn't make sense. I will talk and act one way but then the next day act as if I am someone else.



ussually Iignore myself but my subconscious (I nicknamed it sub so I will refere to it as that) tells me to stop. this is hard to explain so if you want to know more you can ask but for now I am going to move on.


I don't think I am that good of a person, I have a strange desire ti physically and/or mentally hurt others. I try to put this at bay with things like video games and drawing (I draw alot of violence) but I still don't know why its there and it won't go away.



I gett very lonely but never want to interact with others. I'm very asocial a bit more than just being introverted. 

I don't like telling people about my feelings because I don't like being vunlerable. I get anxiety at random times and sometimes fear for my life when I am alone for no reason.



I don't feel happy nor sad but I don't know if I want to change this. I lack motivation even to do things I like.I get frustrated and angry when I make mistakes and often give up easily.

I'm messing up in school, I am too lazy to do things and my mom isn't very helpful about it.

To another year of being depressed and being alone! ð» I hope i can survive :),0
"I know a lot have been discussed about SSRI and their potential sexual side effects. For the last 6 months I have been on Fluoxetine and Duloxetine (my shrink thinks that my depression is a result of bad things that happened to me and was planning to wean and stop them within 1 year). However, I had to take a drug screen for work and I read that Fluoxetine can give a false positive result in the UDS and I didn't want to tell my potential employer that and take anti - depressants for the fear of stigmatizing. Anyway, I stopped both SSRIs 1 week before the test (now is 10 days without them) and I don't feel any different, in fact if anything, I feel happier, but the most striking was my marked increase in my libido and the capability to ejaculate once again :) When I was on the SSRIs I had turned into an asexual creature and if I ""force"" my self to have sex or watch porn I had a half - @ass erection and (kind of whiskey d!ck) and more often than not I had to fake and orgasm (using a condom) or if by any chance I can finish is after a long ""banging"" and with an almost painful spasms of my legs, really weird sense. Now I feel like I am a 30 yr old (I am mid - 40s) - have a ""morning wood"", I regained my interest in sex, I am able to ejaculate, etc. I am nervous to start the meds again, but don't want to go back to the deep depression that I was before in case they had any effect.

Cheers and Happy New Year and success in the sack :)",3
"This is really long btw. So if nobody reads it I understand

I don't even know how to start this off. I'm just in so much pain. My mind has become my prison. I have so much self hatred. I'm also self destructive. 

I moved halfway across the country after high school cause I thought it'd make me happy. Start new and leave all the negative behind. Move in with my dad and start working full time. I eventually move out to my own place. I was so unhappy about my job. I would also feel embarrassed to tell people where I worked. 

So my new mission was to find a better job. Family member hooked me up with a really great job. For a 21 year old kid with no degree this job was great. I was prob making too much money for someone my age lol. A lot of dumb spending and lots of drunk nights. 

The job really did help me out. I use to live in this duplex that had nasty carpet. I had no furniture and I had no plates or anything of that nature. Just my bedroom stuff, one entertainment center with a tv in my living room, and some rickety old stained blue recliner. 

Eventually I put down wood floors and furnished my entire place from top to bottom in a matter of months. I even opened up a good credit card and started building my credit. Was the first time in my life I was able to save money and not live paycheck to paycheck. Lol I even had a health savings account that later paid to have my wisdom teeth removed. I really went far and I was proud of myself for once. 

It just wasn't enough though. I was still in so much pain. A job I loved turned into a job I loathed. I think I was genuinely happy for a couple months max. I ended up working there for two years and some change. 

I left when I decided I should go to school. I'm in a town with a great school and my family has gone to this school for generations. So I put in a month notice at my job and started taking steps to get myself ready for the college life. 

My first semester was a breath of fresh air. I loved it. I loved going to class and doing something I actually wanted to do. That lasted for a whole semester and a minimester. My next full semester? I almost failed this semester. I was very close to getting out on academic suspension. I stopped going to class halfway through. I don't even know if I want to do it anymore.

I'm just running in circles. I think something will be good for me and I go and do it. It helps for s couple of months then I'm back to square one. The amount of hate I have for myself in just ridiculous. I don't think I hate anything even remotely close tot he way I hate myself. 

At my school getting your ring is a big deal. Man I cannot fucking wait to get it either. But after I get it then what? Will it really make me happy?What happens when I finish my degree? Will I be happy then? Will I want more? What happens when I get a job I want? Will that be the turning point? Nothing is enough for me. It just keeps going. It's a never ending pursuit of nothing. Fucking nothing. 

I'm visiting my friends in another state right now. 
Reconnected with an old friend. (Not the one I'm staying with). Things went well and things kind of flames out. Wasn't good. This year comes around and things actually go through. She was very standoffish though after we were with each other the first night. I thought maybe I did something wrong. She continued to be short with me the next day. Then I went and got hammered for the football game and sent some dumb ass drunk texts and I think I've really fucked it up now. She didn't even want to talk to me the next day after.

We are suppose to do something tonight for New Years. However, I feel that won't go through. I just went a fucked it all up with some stupid drunk texts man. 

I just can't get a win and if I do get a win it helps me out for a month. 

I'm a hypocrite, a liar, selfish, and just about everything else. I'm just out here dying and I'm getting closer everyday to just saying âfuck itâ. I just don't know how much more I can take. I've been dealing with since this I was 15. I just didn't know what I was when I was that young.

"So i'm meant to make an oral presentation in the next 4 days... easy right? well i don't want to do it everytime i goto do it i lose all motivation and try to avoid it.


Sometimes i'm asking myself is it even worth it... i mean what will it add to my life...nothing it only makes me a more valuable asset to society a cog in a machine.
I do my best so everyone is happy my feelings or desires are irrelevant.
Society has no place for the weak or unwilling unless you are prepared to be a slave to society and work so you can live you will die.
So i'm studying for what..?
The ability to wake up goto work get home spend 4 hours at most playing games and socializing then goto sleep and repeat?
The accumulation of stress and dissatisfaction renders that a logical life.. it would be irrational to put yourself in that state knowing you are literally digging your own grave.

Yet if you don't do it you die either way ...i'm not strong like most i can't handle as much as others in this society no every society the weak is left to die or used as tools to serve the strong till they die.


I don't want that i don't want to spend my life working a 9-5 job just to get home and distract myself for a few hours before i goto sleep and repeat.
I keep running simulations in my head and the only outcome of that is me snapping and doing something drastic eventually.
one must work to earn their keep and survive but.... we don't have a choice really.

Is it our choice if we live and work to live? No it isn't because if we choose otherwise we are treated with scorn and brainwashed into thinking we are ill or are the problem. we don't really make choices we just do what we are told like slaves.
I'm meant to be comfortable and just accept that though because that's what society is?
I don't want to die...but living like everyone else does that's a fate worse then death to me personally.
I don't want to be given things on a silver platter i want to work but these shackles and the lack of choice that people take for granted are so visible to me.
Truth is we can't do whatever we want even if we are told we can we are just sheep that follow what we are told.
Call this a existential crisis but this society and way of life is malformed...we are gears of a working machine and nothing more.

We drink and eat party and play games and chat with our friends to cheer us up to make us ignore reality i don't want any of that..
I want my freedom to make my own choices and not be bound to the will of others.
I'm considering dropping out of my university course ... i don't want to be like my parents or their parents or the rest i don't want to follow that same path.

Surely i can find a different one right?

I know she likes having me around but I can't shake the thought that everyone would be better off without me. I feel so close to giving up. I have supportive parents which I'm grateful for, and a few friends but I'm feeling an extremely strong urge to isolate myself completely.

"I can't really remember exactly the last time I didn't want to kill myself. The feeling has always been there but I didn't really acknowledge it until about early high school. I can say with pretty good confidence that I've wanted to kill myself everyday since then. 

Reading many posts about what people have been through and their current awful situations just makes me feel more guilty for being suicidal even though I have a caring family and am decently well off. 

My birthday is on new years. I was born just past midnight, so my family and I usually celebrate it on New Year's Eve. However, the last few birthdays I haven't been happy. I always work for my parent's business because we're constantly understaffed. I don't have freedom. I just work. On top of that, I have to deal with the constant desire to just die while having to work. Every year, I'm scared of what the new year will bring, and I resent my parents just a little more for letting me become the happy little accident that I am now. Couldn't they just use a condom? 

2016 has been one giant clown fiesta for me. I'm fully confident that 2017 will be just as bad. I want to make it all end now but I'm too scared of the pain and the nothingness that will consume me once I'm gone. I'm not religious so I don't believe in an after life. Often times I wish I were, that way I'd be more inclined to just get the ""pain"" part over with and to just kill myself already. 

There's no real order to what I'm saying. I'm just venting I guess. I wish I would just kill myself, instead.",2

I don't know if finishing grad school will even make me happy, because how could I ever be happy? I keep searching for meaning or being able to feel SOMETHING, literally anything but this blah-ness that encompasses everything I do. I drink, I go out, I go on rollar coasters, I run away for a month and nothing changes. Everything still feels like nothing. I'm empty. The only time I feel alive is when I'm playing video games because then I'm not me, I'm doing something totally abnormal. But my life is meaningless. There is not light, no happiness. I get brief glimpses of that feeling I don't even remember when my bf hugs me or shows he cares in some small way but overwhelmingly I'm just...empty. And it's isolating to feel like this. I feel so alone. He tries to understand but he doesn't live in my head, he can't know. I appreciate that he tries but I still feel overwhelmingly alone. ",5
"Dealing with my friend's suicide has gotten ... Really bad. To the point of not eating very much for the last month or so. My parents had come over to help me clean on Saturday and I had a headache so I could do little to help, but I tried my best. Tylenol didn't work. My dad ended up getting upset that there's ""always something wrong with me."" He also said a bunch of other bullshit stuff about depression after I had to remind him what I'm dealing with and why I am physically not well at the moment. Ended up locking myself in the bathroom, my cat worrying outside, until they left.

My mom texted me later that she had a talk with him that depression affects everyone differently, and he needs to be more understanding. I explained a little more about my dismal sleeping and eating habits, and clarifying my seemingly growing problems. Fine, we're good. Still pissed because he comes off as very heartless when it comes to depression. He's never been there himself, but my mom has, obviously I have, and their other kid (who I do not associate with for unrelated reasons) also has.

Today my mom came by again, and she keeps going on about ""why don't I do x or y"" and I explain that everything feels like it's lost meaning in all of this. 

And then she pulls the most bullshit line. Again. I have called her out so many times over the last almost 6 years, and I just don't understand how she can still say shit like this after having dealt with depression herself.

""Don't be depressed, you just have to think positive.""

"How do people even do it? TD;LR: I'm reaching out to the depression community on here because I relate to a lot of you. 

I'm at a point in my life where I have like, virtually no friends. My current best friend (I don't know if I'm as important to her as she is to me but I've made talking to her a habit and she really talked me through a lot of my problems and kept me going during the worst of my depression even though we've never met in real life &amp; she lives in another continent. I'm afraid I'm driving even her slowly away, or maybe she's just busy with life. I'm in a bad place where I'm practically doing nothing so I'm always free &amp; my loneliness has made me so clingy that I can no longer bother her with my bullshit. I would love to reach out to other lonely people online and have long conversations about life and so many people have so many online friends these days but nobody stays. Even if I get along with someone online the 'relationship' is short lived &amp; then we don't talk anymore. I know there's a lot of people out there who feel the same way I just wish we could connect so I could feel less fucking alone.  ",4
"My boyfriend seems to have random days where he just wakes up feeling depressed. He says he doesn't care about anything, even things he is normally very involved with or excited to do. I don't think he is suicidal, but it's still concerning and it's hard to say what's going on in his head since he won't talk to me about it. I have once or twice suggested that he talk to someone about it or seek help, but because it's not an every day thing and I don't want to push him, I avoid trying to pressure him too much. I don't know what causes it or what I can do to help, or if there's even anything I CAN do to help him. Looking for thoughts/suggestions on how to handle the situation when he's having bad days.  Thanks in advance! ",4

Do you ever sleep 17 hours? Help me not feel so alone ,5
"I know for a fact that I'm useless s***
So forgive me for my bad grammar and English 

I really don't know where to start but I'm going to say things are heavy on my chest? Idk I don't feel right, so sorry if this was the wrong place 

I really want help from a doctor or whatever, but I don't know who are they or where, I searched online to see where's the best doctors in my country and mostly they weren't in the same city, I've gone to a one in my city, it's supposed to be the best, the appointment cost about 120 dollars maybe *it's not our official currency I just converted* after waiting literally 7 hours *my appointment supposed to be at 1 pm but I've entered 8 pm* the only things she said âit's not really depression you're just lonely without friends and without any life activity, and you know about depression and you don't think yours a big dealâ will she said more than that but that's the summary of it, I've been with her for about 40 minuets... I really didn't feel comfortable with her because how busy she is... she said come to me next week but I didn't go, that's all was before 3 weeks or so... I really don't know what to do and I want someone who I can talk to him, but how? I've never experienced anything like this...
Originally I didn't expect really to go to a therapist... one of my online friends was really trying to push me to a therapist, but the problem he doesn't live in my country so he doesn't know anyone...

One of the things that bothered me when the therapist said âyou need friendsâ I already have friends, maybe dozens of them... online friends, real life friends, and online friends who I've met them... still I feel lonely and lost between them... I'm not really the best person between them... I may be even the worst... I hate being alive...

I'm still 18 people say you haven't experienced life happy things will come... but there's nothing such as happiness... finals are next Tuesday and I haven't studied anything yet... I'm scared of my parents and don't want to talk with them because I hate them... I guess having a D isn't bad... I don't want really to live... self harm my self every 4 days or so, mostly my legs because I can't let my parents see it... ugliest person in earth... tried to suicide two times but I was so scared so bad thing to be alive...I always cry in the shower because that's the only place I can cry without anyone asking... I have a bad relationship with my brother and sister, none of them like me... lately I lose my temper so fast, and it annoy me... not to mention how I hate my body, I used to go the gym daily and lost a lot of wight but I've become worse now... I don't know about my self I'm scared of people or talking to new people or even sometimes my friends...

I used to play video games, having a YouTube channel that was growing really good, I don't feel it's like accomplishing anything thing it's just a crap and I feel depressed so I left it now... it's useless to try anything to be honest 

I really hate wasting my time by watching movies or netflix or anime... and mostly porn... idk I don't know even my self 

Oh also one more thing in high school I used to get high grades but my parents literally was angry at me for not getting âfull gradesâ idk...

Sorry for the useless post, I really felt depressed and Twitter just suspended my account for being suicidel, and I don't have any place to write to someone without knowing who I'm...
Sorry for wasting your time and sorry if I was useless...",5
"I'm fairly young, junior in high school , but I do not wish to disclose my age. My mom is a hardcore muslim, forcing her religion on me and all my sisters. My sisters are much older than I am...one is addicted to adderall, and two are depressed. I developed a drug and alcohol problem  in sophomore year of high school which escalated very quickly. I even almost overdosed off of a combination of xanax and alcohol.

I used all these drugs and alcohol just because they were fun, not because I was depressed or sad or anything. My alcohol problem climaxed when I almost fought a police officer at a party when I was drunk. This led my mom to making me see a psychologist, and I genuinely felt bad for my substance abuse so I left drinking all at once.

During the summer I became addicted to Xanax because I was terrified of my dad catching me drinking, that I just resorted to Xanax, as it is a cheap drunk. When school started in September, I had minor xanax withdrawal and I felt terrible. I started to drink moderately again.

Just some more background... I feel like my dad genuinely dislikes me, and just tries to hide it up with fake conversations. All my sisters tell me my dad is a psycho when it comes to me. My dad always tries to turn my mom against me, calling me a manipulator and all types of shit. We have a shitty relationship as we aren't even close. My alcohol problem is misleading as I still get good grades in school, and I have very good studying habits. I strive so hard in school because I want to leave my shitty life behind

My life started to spiral out of control fast, and I became depressed, anxious, and restless. I partied every weekend and drank a lot, but my parents wouldn't catch me as I am good at acting sober. I started drinking on weekdays, and I started to feel so lonely. 

I finally met a girl, and not to sound corny, but I genuinely fell in love. She likes me a lot, and she actually makes me happy. For some reason she makes me anxious and restless too, so I started to have a harder drinking problem. I do not know why she gets me so restless, but I do know that it's really fucking us up. Because of my mood swings I always begin to flirt with her, getting her hopes up, and then I suddenly crash and I turn her down. I know I'm hurting her a lot, but I have so much shit going on in my life that it distracts me. I think I don't want to get too close to her for a fear of being left and hurt.

My life became hectic when my mom found beers in my room, and my parents realized my alcohol problem was still present. I know my mom genuinely cares, but her shoving religion in my throat gets me angrier, as I can't have a normal relationship with her because she only talks about school and religion. I know my dad on the other hand does not care about my drinking habit, but just that he wants to shit on me.

We had a family party I had to attend to, and I know this was a poor decision, but me and my family friend drank a little bit. I got breathalyzed by my dad when I came home, and I blew a .04. My dad promised he wouldn't tell my mom if I stopped drinking, and I made a deal. When my mom heard from someone that I was drinking, my dad quickly turned on me and texted my mom discretely about our deal. I confronted my dad and he blatantly lied to my face about it, even deleting the messages off his phone and showing it to me, acting like he never texted my mom. My mom gave up on me and said I was garbage with an alcohol problem, and it actually hurt me deeply

I started drinking even harder as I felt my parents stopped caring for me, and my dad caught me with alcohol again, and they told me to leave the house. I was packing my bags, and my mom gave me a bunch of garbage bags. I was about to leave the house when my mom told me that if I left, I would never be allowed back in. I stayed home, and my mom said I was a disgrace and all that shit. I didn't care what she had to say, but she said I might have to go to rehab

I know I have a drinking problem and a lot of psychological problems, but I think it's best I leave the house for a month. I have many friends houses to stay at, and I have enough money to live away from home for a month. I genuinely want to find peace in my life again, and I am in such a shit hole right now that it hurts to think about. I told my sister about leaving the house, and she never dismissed it, as she was kicked out the house for a month too. Is this the right way to find peace in my life again?

"For the past 5 years my New Year's Eves have been nightmares. Each year I get my hopes up to do something fun and I am disappointed. Last year my boyfriend at the time promised me we would plan an awesome New Years in the city. I almost cried I was so happy and excited because I loved him so much, I would get to be that person that got to dress up and have fun and be happy. Wrong. 
He broke up with me Christmas night. Then the next day my grandfather died. Then the whole year sucked after that. Then one of my favorite cats in the world passed away. That hit me hard. Don't judge. 

Now here I am, alone in bed, crying, watching everyone else have fun. I wasn't invited to a single thing by a single person. 

My ex that I'm still in love with has had a new girlfriend for months, that he dotes on and praises and is so happy with. I know they'll post pictures together tomorrow of their New Years together - something I so desperately wanted and never got. He hasn't spoken to me since he met her. Proving I was just worthless shit and she is a complete upgrade that he is happy with.  He doesn't care what happened to me. He got what he wanted - her - he's happy, he's forgotten me. 
And I don't want to hear any tired cliches of ""he's a douche, you have value"",  blah blah. He was only a douche to me because I wasn't what he wanted. He's a perfect boyfriend to the new girl - who is prettier and more fun and more successful than me. I don't mean shit to him, I wasn't good enough for him to put effort into. But she is. And now she's getting everything I wanted.

My friends have forgotten me.
My family doesn't care.
I'm a loser with a shit retail job, can't get a single job with my degree. 
All I have is my cat. 

Taking a handful of sedatives so I can be unconscious as long as possible. I'm not trying to overdose but if it kills me then fine. 

I fucking hate New Years. ",2
This is the saddest New Years of my life. Spending it completely sober and alone. Hopefully i feel lots of baby kicks tonight to cheer me up a bit. I'm hoping everyone out there stays safe and enjoys whatever they're doing to bring in the new year. Cheers mates. ,5
"Welp, here I am.  I dropped out of one of the best colleges in the country last semester because I had no motivation and couldn't focus on schoolwork for the life of me.  I planned to move back in w/ my parents and try to improve myself and eventually transfer to a new school, but I feel stuck.  It's already been a month and I've done nothing.  I have no idea what I want to do, no idea what I should do, and frankly I don't even want to do anything.  I can feel my parents getting restless, and they keep asking me what my plan is and all I can say is ""I don't know yet"".  I don't think they understand depression very well as they are always asking why I do nothing and poke fun at me for sitting around and playing video all day.  I know I should try to plan something, but it just feels like a unclimbable mountain ahead of me.  All my high school friends are heading back to college soon which is going to leave me completely alone.  Fuck.  What   should I do",2
"I've had a rough two weeks and can't study for shit right now. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone and thoughts of suicide are having a hayday. Any belief I used to have in myself being other than a failure has crashed to pieces for the millionth time... But I still have to sit up and shut up, and not show a thing.

My grandparents - ALL of them - are still sick and have been so for several weeks, my grandma had even been rushed to ER but at least she's in recovery now. My family - Mom, Dad and little sister - have had no choice but to rush between them with the little time off work they've had. Except that I'm studying so my family insisted I won't take days off.

My family is busy all week trying to keep the situation under control, and I can't help them. On the other hand I also can't study because I'm so depressed my brain won't work, or rather it works overtime on focusing on how I feel and not on studying. So not only am I a worthless sack of shit on my own, I'm also letting down my family and can't do anything about my depression since they are already so burdened.",5
"For half a year now I'm fighting a fight I can't seem to win. It's like I never even turned 19 this summer. I started university this fall and got together with the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. She was so supportive and caring that she was afraid to speak about her own problems. She broke up with me because of that a week ago. I made her feel worse, it's my fault she broke up with me. The whole second half of 2016 is a blur. Since I've been diagnosed with severe depression in August I tried medication and am currently in therapy. It kinda helps but over the past week I thought a lot. I don't think I can do this. I don't even know if I'm going to be alive at the end of 2017 - but I have to. It just seems so much right now. The break-up, depression, moving out, having no close friends at my university, no sure if I even want to study the subjects I'm studying. I don't know where to begin; where to start fixing this mess I made. I fucked up. I'm not sure what to do when I'm alone in my flat tomorrow evening. I don't even want to think about that situation. I can't do this anymore.",4

"All of my life I've struggled to fit in, which coupled with lots of stress and anxiety drove me to depression. I was incredibly lonely, spending my days sleeping and staring into a screen.

This year gave me hope though, I met the most amazing girl imaginable - intelligent, funny, sweet/kind, romantic, sexy, same interests, everything I've ever wanted. She was the first girl I've ever dated, someone who actually saw me as something other than the ugly, awkward guy. I actually planned to kill myself around that time, but it all went away after that. I was the happiest guy in the world. 

That all changed though after she suddenly attempted suicide a few weeks ago. Now all she does is push me away when I try to be there for her (going as far as to dump me) and refuses to see anything beside the negative no matter how much I try to reassure her. She's like an entirely different person now, definitely not the same girl that told me she loved me every night. Meanwhile, I'm even worse than I was before. 

It's already enough that depression ruined *my* life, but now it's destroying the person dearest to me and there's nothing I can do to stop it. Fuck everything. ",4

"Apparently, people hate it when others talk about their suffering online. People figure if you're talking about how depressed you are on social media, you must be faking it or looking for attention. A sincere cry for help makes you an ""Attention Whore"" apparently. I hate it when people dismiss others' pain as insincere just because they posted about it on social media, and even going as far as to make jokes about it.
Also, I hate people dismissing others' pain because of their age. I saw a tweet once that was like, ""If you're under 23 and claiming to be depressed, you aren't really depressed. You don't know depression until you're an adult"" or something like that, and that certainly isn't true. I knew two people, one in middle school and one in high school, that were hospitalized for weeks from suicide attempts.

Please, don't assume others are making up their pain ""just for fun"" because more often than not, the person behind the screen is actually suffering. 
That's all. It's nearly 3:00 a.m. where I am and my depression has been hitting me rock hard lately. I figured I'd get around to posting on here sometime.",4
"So I went to therapy twice last week with my first therapist. I was upfront with her that I wanted therapy in addition to possible medication (my anxiety is unbearable at times and my depression has gotten a lot worse lately). She said she doesn't believe in meds and won't refer me to a psychiatrist, but I can't self refer to any psychiatrists because the wait times in my area are so extreme that they only accept referrals for adult patients. I feel really comfy with her as a person and we've started to build a good rapport, but I've been struggling with intense anxiety since I was a child and depression for over a decade. I'm not formally diagnosed but I work in mental health care and I know what anxiety and depression disorders look like. I want therapy and I want to be psychiatrically evaluated and supported too. So should I try to switch therapists to  someone who has a more similar medical philosophy to my own or stick it out with this one that I like so far (besides her refusal to help me get in meds)? 

I don't have a lot of people I can get support from for a decision like this so i appreciate any help or advice you guys have. ",3

"It seems like I was put into a family and city I don't belong in.  So of course I tried to move around to find the right place but since it was right after highschool , I never found a good enough job to sustain myself, so I came home and went back to school.

I've been back half a year, got straights As, and was pretty proud of myself.  The hardest part for me is that I can't find a job, even though ive tried.

Holidays are over, everyone's back to their own life , and I get hit with the backlash.  Saying I'm useless and lazy because I'm not a working and productive person in the world.  My dad basically told me I was a loser and if I'm not working by tomorrow I'm out of the place.  Being told your useless , a loser, losing your place to live, for something you are working for , is a horrible combination to hit someone struggling with anxiety and depression.

This time tomorrow Ill be homeless, and I don't have basically any friends from moving back, so I have no one I can turn to now but my own head is driving me into a downward spiral .

I have been doing good depression wise.  Doing the right things and the next best step, but now I have lost all motivation to even open my eyes. The past 2 days have been me waking and falling asleep crying knowing tomorrow I have nothing and no one, and contiplated ending it . Tomorrow im terrified because once it happens I know I'll loss all hope.

"I spent another birthday alone. My 30th. Not that it makes much of a differences since I have spent most days of my life alone. Not even posting in r/viriginityexchange at the last minute in the hopes of a pity fuck worked.

I am unable to pass whatever social filter that allows for normal sexual interactions.

I have laid next to two women naked in their respective beds. Neither time did I believe they were genuinely attracted to me and I am still not sure they were. I missed those opportunities to lose my virginity many years ago. Since then I have become uglier, fatter, and bald. I am so bitter and negative there is no way I will seem attractive to anyone, least of all myself.


I could blame with the conservative and severely orthodox Catholicism that taught me to hate myself and my own sexual urges. Still recovering from this. I could blame the terrible role models of relationships in my life since my parent's and family's' relationships look like stories written by Updike. I could blame my own past. Regrettably, I have to blame my own cowardice. My own hatred of myself  poisoning my veins resulting in endless pity parties and destructive hedonism. 

It doesn't matter what the causes are now. It is too late. If I ever got up the courage to ask someone on a date and by some miracle they agreed, the actual road to sexual or affectionate behavior would be so pitiful and pathetic she would doubtlessly be turned off or just laugh at my inexperience.

I am going to die a virgin and alone. Whether that death is natural or by my own actions I don't know. It won't be today or tomorrow, but the loss of having missed out on so much is unbearable. I am missing out on the essential human connections that our stories, songs, movies, and every aspect of human culture scream as being the most important part of our humanity.

i will go without brushing my teeth, washing my face, showering, and changing my underwear for as long as possible without it being super noticeable or causing significant damage to my health. why care about my health? health problems can cost money, and money problems can easily become an issue for my family and not just me. and then of course, i can't have others noticing my poor health and worrying.

They never got to it and they sold my home on dec23. I've been trying to see if there's anything I can do but since the sale date already happened I'm pretty much done. I haven't received a letter telling us when to move out yet but I know it's coming. 

So needless to say I've been very depressed and just for lack of a better term fragile. I'm lost. Sad. I don't know what to do. I've failed my family. 

Now this morning I was in a very depressed mood and my SO just blew me off and said to get over it. Like it's something I can just get over by snapping my fingers. 

I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna make some pirogies and I think after that I may finally hang myself cause I'm finallyso overwhelmed with depression and pain I don't think it will go away. 

I've never felt this bad in my whole life. I've lost everything and I have no support system what so ever. I just don't want to keep this fight up anymore. ",5
"I thought I was getting over it. But now after eight years my depression has reached a new stage. I've managed to self-medicate with video games and youtube for years, but over the past couple weeks it stopped working. Now nothing is interesting anymore. 

It's driving me absolutely bonkers. I'm so stir crazy. I'm SO BORED. But I don't want to to do anything. Nothing feels worth my time. Everything makes me feel guilty that I'm not doing something else. 

I wish I knew hot how to emphasize how bad this is. I can FEEL it inside me, like a thirst. Like I'm craving some physical thing and if it was in front of me I'd pounce and devour it like a tiger. I've always felt uncomfortable in my skin, now it's like all of me. I need to rip myself apart to tear the corruption out. 

I'm going mad, just mad. Like I desperately need a sedative or something before I spiral out of control. I've never thought more seriously about hospitalizing myself. If I wasn't afraid of the treatment I'd get I'd do it now. Someone please give me some advice.",5
"I have never been diagnosed with depression, although my girlfriend has. She frequently has periods of extremely low moods that can go on for days or even weeks, and has attempted suicide in the past. 

Whenever I see her like this it eats me apart from the inside with guilt, because I feel like it's my responsibility to help her and make her feel better and when I can't I feel like shit. I feel like a failure whenever this happens and I don't know what to do.

Does anyone here know what to do? Or how to help? I hate watching this happen to her and I feel so guilty.
",5
Nothing I do feels real. I feel like I've lost myself because I don't enjoy anything anymore. Everything I do just fills me the same feelings of saddens or anger I don't know what to do anymore. What can I do to turn the corner and get out of this state.  ,5
"It's 1:44PM and it's already good. (Compared to the HORRIBLE day I had yesterday...) 
I got a sudden motivation to do stuff and I did all the homework and studying I couldn't do before and I wanna make myself and my mom proud :)
I finally released a rap I've been working for months this morning
And I'll do a shower at the end of the day just to finish it off :)",0
"In all shortness I just moved and tomorrow at noon I gotta hand in the keys for the old flat, but here I am on the floor in my old flat and have yet to empty all the cupboards in the kitchen and do all the cleaning.

There's at least one large car load worth of things to move and I havent got a car or a license - so cant even rent a car and get it done. First I thought to walk with things (only moved a few blocks), like I have already done two times, but it's notably difficult to do so (and since it's getting late I'm contemplating a taxi. One can use a taxi for this, right?).

I've had months to get this all done but of course here I am having procrastinated like hell and dealt with anxiety by knocking myself out cold to sleep. And since the support system is 99% parents I keep silent about this and dont wanna bother them more than this move already has. So yet again I've put myself in an utterly idiotic position of misery.

Tomorrow comes with work again but I am honestly contemplating calling in sick and dealing with this shit between morning and noon instead of now (been here all day and it is now late evening).

Another sad part is that today has actually been a very productive day compared to what I normally pull off.

And this just sucks. Landing myself in this position sucks, getting myself out of this position sucks. When it's done and over with it will still suck.

"Okay so this is extremely embarrassing and I have been called everything under the sun from lazy to useless, I have been out of full time employment since 2013 with only one seasonal summer job as a parts driver for a helicopter company last summer. 

In my previous work place which was known as a starter company for the trade I was trying to get into I worked myself into sickness and was bullied by grown ass men into depression. This all culminated into a bad back injury from lifting a 12x12 with a coworker when the coworker slipped and I tried to compensate which made me slip a disc. I was bullied into not filling for workers comp and put on light duty for 2 weeks, this all happened around the time I was finally supposed to get my apprenticeship. Instead I was laid off, to which no one told me until I drove the hour to work but everyone seemed to know the day before. 

So this is the embarrassing part, I had a mental breakdown in my truck then drove home crying. I was so frustrated so angry. I should have gone then and there to the competitor in town and applied for a job, but I couldn't bring myself to so I took a few days for myself and started applying for more entry level trade jobs. Now if you haven't been in or tried to get into a trade, most of the time the only way your going to even get a interview is if you know someone who works for the company. Which unfortunately I was 20 at the time and just starting out, so of course I didn't know anyone in the trade. And then whole oil glut/oligarchy thing happened which made it even harder. 

So I did that for a year, had to move back with my parents, my parents gave me shit when I tried to sell my truck  and they took on the payments. I shouldn't have let them I know, it made me feel so shitty and it still does. So then summer hits and my best friends family owns a helicopter company and this was a big fire year in my province, so he asked me if I could give him a hand so I did. I wish I could still work for them, I didn't think people could be so nice at a workplace. Then summer ended and  they didn't need me anymore, so I went back to looking. Then last winter I slipped and slipped my disc again only this time was much worse and I was laid up for 6 months doing pt, getting injections and seeing a chiropractor. 

Now I've been out of work with almost nothing to show for my time for so long and I have nothing to put on my resume. I did do a few courses to try and get something but that didn't pan out. I have my h2s, csts, first aid and forklift and zoomboom tickets. I just want to live, not exist. I need work, I've tried applying for everything under the sun the past few months. Every day gets harder and harder at this point I think I should just kill myself to relieve my parents of a financial burden , and a embarrassment. I feel like such a failure, I tried my hardest I really did I swear I'm not lazy I'm trying, please I just want to be a person again. 

If you read all that, thank your for taking the time to it really means a lot to me. It's hard for me to type this out and even harder for me to hit the post button. Sorry for getting pretty emotional towards the end and also for any grammatical errors English is my second language.

Whenever I think about ending it all I think about my parents crying over my body. So I just keep trucking through this miserable existence as a proxy for my parents' happiness.,4
"I do not consider myself as ever having had depression, but issues of conformity vs individuality, agnosticism/skepticism and romantic love vs. unconditional love for humanity have turned me to a dark place over this winter break and today during the first day of school. 

My relationship between me and my parents isn't close where we say we love each other, make physical contact, or talk a lot, and I fear it is my fault because of how difficult I was in the past possibly, and I also just don't feel love, give love, or subscribe to the idea of love much, only to helping people for the sake of helping people. I guess emotions really are a weak spot for me as an INTP. Many people upon meeting me have noted that I'm very cold and aloof. I was feeling angry at them recently for going against what I believed to be my personal and innate way of living, but now I am not sure. Today at school my teacher said ""how are you"" to me and this girl who had been bothering me for a long time, who I would get angry at but I had never talked to, who seemed to keep smiling at me and looking at me subtly as I would also look at her because I wanted to know what was going on, turned around slightly when she heard that and probably smiled. I still don't feel sure about her intentions but I think she was employing satirical techniques, which we just learned about in class today, and she is in my class, to try to prod me in the right direction, seeing how lonely and disconnected I was. (TO PUT ME OUT OF MY EGOTISM AND WEAK BUT DEEP TOXIC SENSE OF COMPETITIVENESS.) Today in psychology my class also started learning about motivation and emotion, and that was eerily attuned to my situation, because in the past few nights I didn't have motivation to do the work I needed to do, so I failed to do it. I also was going through a lot of different emotions. 


I keep getting sudden feelings that my life has just significantly changed, like today, and I feel like I am so stupid and I don't know how I was able to feel normal before, how I could be blind to it, but it is just so confusing. I find it kind of hard to look back on the past few months and remember what I was thinking. I see myself as just kind of having been a zombie in the past.

So I felt very stupid today, and I was going through my classes in an obviously different mood, which I now regret because I think I looked weird in front of one of my teachers. I kept seeing different ways how I had failed to accept love and integrate it into my life, and how I was nothing without it, how I was such a failure in so many ways. I was considering seeing a school therapist, and I talked to the few friends I had about the day's events, causing stress for them probably. I was skeptical of the idea of love for a long time though, as I wanted to study it in psychology before deciding what to do on that subject, and I kept feeling like I should only love certain people, and not really like or dislike other people but just want to help them when possible. I was always very individualistic and recently I had this silly thought Satan would visit me one night because I could relate to Lucifer. I didn't want to put my faith into anything, not some god or even unconditional love really. But we trust our intuitions all the time anyway, and I don't know what to do. It might just be a kind of unnecessary and bad thing to care so much about being skeptical of everything, and doing so could be egotistic. I have had the idea in recent times that maybe I could completely get rid of the ego and not care how I did compared to others, only focus on being the best I could be. And I don't think that was an idea I didn't accept, I think I accepted that idea.

I should note I had loving feelings for a teacher I have and I was scared to ever interact with her besides just being in the class, but this was something I was holding on to and I had feelings of wanting more of it. Not being able to love makes me feel guilty all the time, and I think I was labelling my problem as not being able to make friends and being lonely but really it was not being able to get and give love with friends and people. I couldn't make friends because I didn't have the right view of people.",4

"Hey reddit

So i've decided to get myself tested for depression. Ever since i was about 13,14 (am 21 now) i've had these feeling of dread and just haven't been happy with myself. I have talked about these feeling recently with some of my mates and they all think i do have depression this also includes my EX who has tried to get me to go doctors for the last 2 years. So the reason why am posting here is too ask what i should expect from the doctors (i live in the uk) and what will change if i decided to go on antidepressants? 

Any advice would be useful am not very good at sharing my emotions unless am pissed up.",4

"Is there any dating site or group for people with depression?

"Im a junior this year in Highschool, my GPA is below 3, which for people who don't know, 3.0 is a B average. I'm smart, I haven't taken the SAT yet but my PSAT score was 1300, I do well on tests, A average, but I am failing 2 classes this year because I dont do my homework. I am afraid.
I dont know where my future is. My parents think I am a genius, Ive never wanted to work to be rich, just to live and everything else goes to helping others. At this point it will be hard to get in a decent college, and even if I do I'm not sure I can stay in. 
Im not sure if its worth it. Everything I know tells me how inconsistent life really is, in 2 years colleges may be free, I may be dead I really have no idea. Why work for something that may never arrive?

"Where do I start? No friends really, because of drama. (crush drama, to be specific.)

I have some online friends who are really supportive and tell me I'm smart, when I don't really feel like it. I fail in basic stuff alot. It's hard to explain to someone who doesn't have the same problem.. Academically I guess I'm decent, I do get good grades, but only because I always ask for help and focus, I don't have friends to talk with at lessons so might aswell focus. In handwork / woodwork, whatever you want to call it, the teacher asked me âAre you stupid or what is your problem?â also, I'm bullied in school, luckily not physically but they say annoying stuff and attack my YouTube channel and come at my house to throw stuff at the wall, and ring the bell a million times. If anyone is wondering, I'm 14 and a male. Also I'm never ever gonna commit suicide. Any opinions on what should I do? I just feel completely retarded and stupid.",4
What a great start to the year :(,0
"I had to let go of my dream career, what I was passionate about doing for the rest of my life. You see, for years I was chasing this dream and it finally came knocking at my door. I wanted to be a police officer. I talked to everyone about it. Went on ride a longs. You. and it. I really believed in helping and protecting people. That was my calling. Due to what life throws at you, I was able to start applying in my late 20's. And today, at the age of 32, I said no. See, in the 4-5 years it took me to get accepted somewhere, one has to keep going with life. And I did. I got married, got a decent job with decent pay, was able to buy a tiny home. Just life. I have been lucky and I am thankful. 

However, I am slowly dying inside. I can't stop running to the bathroom to cry for the last 2 weeks. I am close considering going to the hospital to get stress leave for work. 

So why did I do it? Well in short: a bunch of excuses. Didn't feel physically ready for the daily challenges which I was told could lead to my dismissal from the academy; during the time I did exercise and prepared myself I injured myself a lot (knee, back, shoulder), which at the academy could lead to a possible dismissal; also, the academy is a âlive-inâ academy, meaning that Monday-Friday I would live at the academy, something my wife was having a lot of emotional problems dealing with that thought; lastly, I would be lying if I said that the whole live-in academy situation did not worry me - it was, and a lot. There has always been something âwrongâ with me when it comes to attachment. I am that guy that cannot say good-bye. And the thought of being away from my wife 5 days a week and dealing with the stresses of an academy really worried me to the point that I knew I would want to come home. So I made the âadultâ decision that it would be stupid to go knowing I would not make it and risk my financial stability. 

So now I'm sitting here. In tears writing this. The last two weeks have literally been like death. I have nothing to look forward to. I have nothing that interests me. I am not applying to any other departments because of my age. My body was holding on to this academy and I don't have it in me anymore. I really have no purpose. I hate everything about my job - it eats my soul bit by bit. I don't have suicidal thoughts. But I do feel like I'm sitting here for another 40 years waiting for my turn to go. Oh and of course, I don't have anyone else to talk to but to my wife and I have worn her down a lot. She has been so great. ",2
"My dad has had a long history of cheating on my mom, every time though he always denies it. I don't understand it, what exactly is he protecting with his pride? Does he not see what's happening to my mom?! Everyday since Christmas, my mom has been on the verge of tears and my dad still either doesn't notice or doesn't care. The problem is that my mom and I are both powerless because my dad has us under his money. I don't know what to do anymore; we still haven't confronted him about it because (1) he'll just deny it and (2) it's his word against ours. My dads family is wealthy and they're all a bunch of fucking elitists and my dads family protects him like he's an angel. My aunt and brother, in the past, instead of going after my dad for his shit, they instead put all the blame on my mother. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WIT PEOPLE?! My mother has been through 2 cancers and survived, had just retired form her stressful office space and now she's being treated like this by some shithead of a father?!

I can't even talk to him anymore even though I desperately want to. I feel awful about hurting him and talking to him will make it worse no matter how much I wish I could.

I had a ""break up"" with a very close friend recently as well, someone who I share years worth of memories with and used to hang out with weekly. She posted a picture on her instagram story two days ago of her at a specific theme park (plans we had together) with someone else, and then yesterday she posted a picture of her with some new friends captioned ""best gifts of 2017"". My other friends think she is trying to make me jealous.

I live with my parents and my dad has been treating me like shit, today I literally thought he was going to kill me over an unwashed dish. I'm just tired of the abuse, I've gotten enough from him and my mom's ex bf combined. I don't understand what I did to deserve any of that but I guess it will always be beyond me.

On top of all this, I'm becoming very unmotivated in college and life in general, I'm afraid of not being successful in what I truly am passionate about, and I have no job (I quit because of anxiety) and need a new one soon because I'm going to run out of money. 

I feel like shit and like a terrible person, I can hardly eat and I've basically just been crying all day. I have no NYE plans (obviously) and I just hate my life so much. The guy I met recently wants to go out for coffee this upcoming week, and I agreed even though I feel hesitant. I'm just having trouble accepting that I can't physically be with the guy I love. I feel awful for what I've done.

"I feel humbled each time I go in this sub as it comforts me knowing there's more people with fucked up minds too.

Don't know if there's a specific section for this but I just need some advice from others who may relate to my thoughts (this is kinda like a penny for your thoughts situation)

I'm done. Tired of feeling paralyzed in my mind. Tried to cry due to the overwhelming feelings of shame, self loathing, anger and pure fucking unexplainable misery but again I'm not even allowed the privilege to alleviate and try to find resolution.

Not even going to try and kill myself as it is fleeting, each a failure and my life being the biggest. Been to all the therapists and doctors who all gave up on me as my mind is broken beyond repair and all I get now is the ""is does get better"" bullshit when it does absolutely nothing for me. I'm just so tired of everything now and im getting frequent waves of pure hatred for people in general which makes me just want to be someplace alone. I hate being around people as they all seem to shit rainbows and unicorns which highlights just how fucking miserable and alien I am. I feel so defeated like why do I have to put every ounce of effort to fake a smile and turn up to obligations such as work as society wants ""happy and self motivated individuals"" which is all a load of shit. I also cant comprehend how and why people are so naturally happy. Like it's almost New Year's Day and I can hear again such loud reminders of how the vast majority of people are normal and happy beyond belief reigning in on the new year when I'm sat alone in my room, had a breakdown wanted to kill myself again with new inventive methods as my previous ones have eluded me like my sanity and contentment towards life.

Again, why can't I just feel basic emotions? Why am I forced as this hollow, pathetic husk of a person and my mind being a shattered vessel lost miles down in a fucking  sea  somewhere when all ""normies"" around me are full of shits and giggles being so blissfully ignorant drinking and getting piss lit. Why can't I smile as I feel positive emotions or laugh at something funny  or even feel scared I could be chased by a crackhead or a clown or something. Nowadays there's nothing. I don't smile. I don't eat or sleep properly. NOTHING is worth doing all hobbies and shit I liked are a chore or a pass time now I'm just counting down the days and even this year has been this shittest and yet I'm still coming into terms how my attempts have left me alive and why I'm continuing. Why bother living if I'm not happy or content and I'm living in auto pilot. I dissassociate my way through life and I'm hitting 20 in 2 months.

I just need something to help at this point. Restarting my 700th therapy session/s on Friday so hopefully she can sprinkle some fairy dust in my water or some shit cus as far as things go I'm losing the slither of faith I have left. 

Thank you for listening. It's 1hr 30mins till New Year's and I hope I fall asleep as I'm not listening to all the fireworks and all this bullshit. Nothing to celebrate for me .

I know I'm in there somewhere buried deep. Just need to find a way to climb back to the top and be in control.    So far I feel like I've lost myself majorly and I'm not being my authentic self which is frustrating but I just need help moving away the debris and letting the water through.",5
"Hey all, sorry for the upcoming long-winded post but yeah, I'm feeling so down the past few months.

All started when my elder brother moved in, but before that, a brief background. I remember I used to have dreams of a particular job; well-adjusted, motivated. All of that ended when my eldest brother turned tail on me and accused me of selling secrets to a third-party, which I never did, but knowing that I might have wronged him, I apologized in a semi-self justifying way. That was my mistake, and of course he never accepted it. He was also backed by his wife and his wife's family over his decision to accuse me.

I looked up at him like a son would to his father, and his betrayal wrenched my heart so much it still hurts inside.

Moving forwards, not even my elder brother believed me, and kept telling me to admit my fault, in which case I never did anything. I also felt betrayed, but until the fateful day he was kicked out of living with my eldest brother, he didn't believe me and I rather liked living a pointless, solitary life with depressed me and my aunt. I didn't feel alive, but neither did I feel so utterly dead.

Now, when he moved, he's kinda bossy; the type to demand respect and not earn it. He forced me to find a job which created pressure and friction to my ego, because while I knew I was getting nowhere, I also needed the job, but he kept berating at me and my uselessness. It further spiraled my depression. This was the 'first' phase. Knowing full well nothing would go well with our permanent arrangement, I found a job at a colorless call center, which while greatly paying, stole all life I had on dreaming and hoping, and painted me an utter cynic. I only looked for the high of getting pay, feeding myself, and of course, pretending I was well while I was abused by customers. This of course continued until it was bearable to a point, but I was transferred between accounts. This shift in the playground furthered my lifelessness and having been moved to Comcast, because fuck Comcast, I handed my resignation and left the company. I found a job in sales, but the accumulated cynicism in the last 6-8 months killed whatever ability I had to close a sale. This was my fault, and no sooner than 2 months they kicked me out. I felt... free and semi-happy after that, ironically. It was shortlived, because I am fretting at the lack of funds I have (rather I built up some savings but I don't have income; that's distressingly worrying).

The call-center depression was over and I initially steeled myself to finding day-shift jobs. But, whatever happened, I wasn't able to find a job; due to circumstances, I can't *not* declare my 2 month stint because it would reflect on my taxes and I could get kicked for that. So I had to justify myself to companies who weren't really biting it. I don't want to go back to a call-center, but I guess I would still have easy entry over there.

This brings us to now. My elder brother is berating me for a lack of jobs, and when I ask him for advice, he basically tells me the obvious 'just get over it, be positive, yadda.' If I knew how to do that, I wouldn't want to stay being depressed. Then he throws me the bomb that I should shut up because my negativity was affecting him, and he wants to stay positive.

I feel massively betrayed and not too long ago I wanted to scream but it's the early mornings; I'd rather not. So I now feel incredibly useless, because I can't find a job I can tolerate, I feel non-functioning, all I do is worry other people and emit negativity, and I can't really help myself in any substantial way. Not even faith is helping me; it's even preventing me from dying because I'm too scared.

I feel so utterly useless and defeated, and I keep wondering why, if there's a protector watching above, why would they allow this? And I am so stretched apart I feel pained all over. Hell, basically all I do is mull over important decisions without deciding on one.

I feel so useless; and while I would want to visit a psychiatrist, I don't have the funds to maintain it.

I just wish I knew how to help myself. I'm still attached to the shadows of my past I can't move on to find better things.

I wish I didn't exist to trouble other people. So, apologies for having you listen to my rant; I have no idea what I was hoping to achieve here, looking back.",4
"I can't stand to do anything else. I always have to distract myself with these fantasy worlds. I hate everything else. I hate being alive. I want to kill myself. I can't bear to do this anymore. My life is just one distraction after another. Everything else makes me too anxious. Too many wasted opportunities, too much wasted time, and too much bullshit in my past to make my future at all worthwhile. I feel so trapped.

I can't wait until New Years. I don't remember ever spending a New Years with anyone.",5
"When I was severely depressed, my therapist recommended using distraction to prevent myself from being consumed by flashbacks of former trauma. This was necessary during that time; now my mood is stable (I'm consistently exercising and meditating), but I continue to need to distract myself. I've spent entire days with earbuds and listening to podcasts because of this habit. Does anyone else deal with this? Has anyone broken the habit?",4
"I've been seeing my boyfriend, let's call him Danny, for a few months. He's great, a real sweetheart, very funny and smart and communicative. I really love being around him. He's also severely depressed, and has been for years. He's on medication and sees a therapist.

The fact that he is depressed doesn't bother me, lots of people at my university are, and he's had a very hard life so it's not all that surprising anyway. But sometimes he does really reckless shit that I don't know how to react to in a helpful, supportive way. Specifically, tonight (NYE) he went and got suuuper drunk with some friends and wound up eating a bunch of vitamins and then forcing himself to throw up. I know this because after Danny sent me about a dozen completely unintelligible texts, one of his friends took his phone and messaged me to tell me what was up and reassure me that he was okay.

My knee jerk reaction was anger - that he would drink so much when he knows he's not supposed to mix alcohol with his medication, and that he would do something so reckless. I mean, I don't know how dangerous eating a handful of vitamins actually is, but I've heard it's bad and so has he. And he's been very suicidal before, before I met him, so the general behavior just scares me. But then again, he probably was just muching on them because they tasted good and ya know, drunk brain. 

Obviously getting mad and yelling at him or whatever isn't going to help much though. Is there a better way for me to react that still makes it clear that he upset and scared me? Some kind of general rule of thumb for dealing with this kind of behavior? General advice? Am I over thinking it? Is this the wrong subreddit (my bad if so)?

I love the guy and want to be a good partner to him. I just don't know how. Thanks in advance for any responses!",4

"Hi everyone. I have a friend who has been diagnosed with depression. I have told her that I'm there for her on multiple occasions, but haven't been able to help her in any other way, at least one that feels like it's had a meaningful effect. Her performance in school has progressively been going down; the only thing that seems important to her is theater. Im sure you all know how high school theater is. Self-confidence can either thrive or struggle to survive in there.

I have tried to coax her into adopting a hobby like drawing, just anything to use her time constructively, but to no avail. Some days she simply chooses to stay in her room.

I'd be grateful if you could give me some advice. I just don't know what's going on in her mind and I don't want to lose her.",4

But I realised that it's important for our mental well-being to do some form of activity. So I decided to join a bellydance class - a hobby that will keep me fit but also be enjoyable, since I loved dancing when I was child. I think we should all try to find a hobby to distract ourselves from our low moods and if we get really good at it, who knows, maybe we could enter competitions or make money from doing it on the side. 

But the most important part is to see what good we can get from it mentally and the distraction it brings. Remember achievement of any form is important for improving our already shattered self-esteem. ",5

"and it is becoming difficult to stay focused. There is a loss of interest in activities I typically enjoy, a growing desire to be around/talk with friends, yet the drive to isolate is developing a storm within myself.

I am in my thirties, many worries I had in my twenties are gone (job, housing, making friends). The struggle is in the remaining challenges. I value myself by how desirable I imagine I am. I define my desirability by how needed I am in mainly non-monetary ways (i.e. work doesn't really count, though it gives me some strength). Often I find more time on my hands than others, which leads me to reach out to friends much more than being reached out to instead. My friends and family say they enjoy spending time together and we make small talk about promises to connect. Many friends and family are actually busy and may only find time to connect infrequently. I can only see/share a snapshot of our lives and our connections. This makes me feel like less of a person. I want more people (two to three friends someday day) I connect with more than quarterly or annually. 

This has been a generally positive year. This lull has been much less severe than in prior years (during the holidays specifically). The sadness is more powerful in the duration and lack of attributable events. I want a reason to be sad, to fight or deconstruct said reason and ""bounce back"" or at least have an argument against these feelings. 

The hum of daily activities continues, heavy in each moment. A white noise that slowly is clouding my routine ushering me closer to the basics of eat, work, sleep, then repeat. The fog is comforting in the simplicity of the path left for me to travel, however the path is not the direction I want. 

I want to see around me again, I want to clearly view my challenges and triumphs, and most of all I want to feel desirable again. The time it takes to push through this cycle is exhausting. I wish to rid myself of this monotonous hum that is pushing me towards isolation.

I have no real expectations of improving my situation from posting, yet I am hopeful I might be distracted for a bit by sharing. It provides a sense of value to think what I say has an impact on myself or others.  

Thank you for taking the time to read this, it feels good to imagine I am being heard.

"I was with a group of friends last night, and another friend started talking to another friend about how many girls secretly liked him and stuff. It was crazy, because no one has ever talked to me about things like that. Then, on the way to the pub, a group of girls basically called me unattractive. Funny how girls are never shy about calling me ugly, but they're apparently too shy to ""approach me"". I never get signals, I've had shit luck on dating sites, no one ever approaches me, no one has ever had a crush on me, and my family are the only people that call me handsome. Nothing tells me that I'm ugly based on how girls treat me versus how they treat other guys.

I attempted to convince her, since I have a history with suicide attempts and depression. She said ""I can't promise anything"". She wanted to go offline for a while, so I just wanted to let her know how I felt.

"I don't know why I thought anyone might ever care when the cold reality is that no one ever does and the harsh truth just slapped me hard in the face. My best friend and I were out for a walk, talking about everyday stuff and how we're both doing pretty bad in university.

"For the life of me, I can't figure out what is keeping me from eating a fistful of pills so I can continue to do the only thing I actually want to do, sleep. I have no one. Even that backup friend I never really liked in the first place, gone. I'm not sure how it happened. It was like one day everyone turned on me. Each situation and bridge burned is more baffling than the next. I feel like the universe is fucking with me.

For example: Last night my landlord and his wife called me together, bc I didn't pay my rent. In California we don't have to pay rent until the following day if it falls on a bank holiday. When I tried to politely explain that a bank holiday meant I cOuld not go inside a bank, I received a twenty minute lecture from them both, (because everyone talks to me like I'm an incompetent female), about how everyone has to pay rent. 
This resulted in my driving around to various stores to get âcash backâ following a transaction bc due to daily atm withdrawal limits being$400 and the bank being closed, I had no other way to access the money in my account. So even though I went out of my way to do that series of inconvenient errands, my landlord was still had this to say: 

âI have to say this is not how it should be and I will refrain from saying more.
So, it is very late.â

To which I replied : 

âI agree so I'll refrain as well because this is also incredibly inconvenient for me. That's why there is a law for this.â

From this followed an incredibly uncomfortable in person exchange of cash. Now this where the baffling part comes in. This is what every day of my life had been like for the last six months. It's one giant shit on Natasha fest where this dumb incompetent girl can't possible be right. ...

As soon as I arrive home from the exchange of cash, I receive a very agitated phone call from my landlord and his wife saying that I did not hand them the correct amount of money. Lucky for me, I had some downtime in the car before the handoff, so I had counted it so many times I remembered that there were 38 twenties 4 tens and one hundred dollar bill. So in the middle of the screaming I try to interject that maybe they could tell me what bills were there so I could see if maybe one dropped in my car. As I'm asking reportedly for him to count the number of twenties, over the screams of his wife saying not to count it again because they did and it's not there, he finally begins to count and shockingly, all the twenties are there. Then shit gets real weird. I start having to argue basic math. I'm on the phone and I'm speechless bc as most people with a calculator or third grade math know, 20 X 38 = 760. So I'm fucked. I am speechless. If they aren't going to believe math, something essentially black and white, i might as well start speaking a different language bc nothing I say matters. 

Eventually I could hear the husband starting to realize that maybe the cash did add up correctly so I gave them an out by saying maybe they wanted to call me back in a few minutes. Later I received a text saying, 
âIt's all here. Goodnight.â
No apology. 
And so is my trash heap of a life. Empty. No human relationships. No money. No passion. No desire to get out of bed. And frustrated to tears. 

I hate crying. I spend everyday frustrated to tears.

I wish I was dead.

Anyways. This is my first post to an Internet forum. I wonder if anyone actually reads this through to this part. I know I would have skimmed and skipped a long time ago. Jesus even I bore myself.

"So at least i made it this far, finally writing something here after lurking for a long time. 

I'm not entirely sure why I am so sad all the time, there is almost nothing in my life I feel I can complain about. I was never bullied, I have a loving supportive family, haven't been sick in a few years so somewhat healthy(although i drink a lot of coke), average intellect, average height, skinny. I have such low interest in things that my little income is way higher than rent+food. I went to the movies 2x this whole year, no hobbies to speak of (Watching TV shows and browsing the internet is barely a hobby).

I tried finishing my Computer Science degree at some point but every year went something like: School-&gt;Work during summer-&gt;Some school-&gt;Depression-&gt;Quit school. Had quite a few hobbies that started out fun and engaging but then got boring fast so I found another one. Now I feel like I have spent all my options for short-time happiness and I'm getting closer to the deep end of depression.

Everything I used to love to do just seems pointless right now, everything I aspired to be has vanished, I'm still fairly young(almost 30) but feels like life is passing me by. I have never had a partner or even kissed someone and people around me are having kids and successful careers.
I have now had a stable job for a year and it is killing me. I hate that job because I find it so meaningless, it's just an entry level IT job but deep down I feel like I should be doing something else. My friend recommended me for that job and now they are firing him because I have a little more education than him. That has not made our relationship stronger, he says it's no big deal but I can't but blame myself somehow, and I can't just quit because the rent would eventually eat my reserves and I would have to move back to my mother.

I don't know where this rant is going, just feeling quite bad that another year has gone by and I'm going less and less out of the house. Depression has hit like a truck over the holidays and I'm having a hard time seeing anything positive happening in the near future.

"Hello r/depression,

Recently I have finally made sure that my tolerance to all kinds of psychiatric medicines is higher than average. That is, I have to take doses higher than average / recommendation to achieve the same level of therapeutic effects. Personally I like the effects of the medicine combination of sertraline (Zoloft) and bupropion XL (Wellbutrin XL), but I have progressively felt the need to increase the dose.

Have / had anyone ever been on sertraline (Zoloft) 300mg or more? Did it work better for you? Did any adverse effect happen?

Have / had anyone ever been on bupropion XL (Wellbutrin XL) 450mg or more? Did it work better for you? Did any adverse effect happen? (I have known that this medicine can increase seizure risk when in high dose.)",3
I can't fall asleep. Is 5:06 am I just went down stairs and ate a lot of food and now I hate myself.,5
"Severely depressed and isolated. Wondering when this inner pain and struggle will end?
Every appointment I have gone to has resulted in nothing but disappointment.
Nobody seems to know how to help me, not even my therapist.
Last night I attempted suicide. Could you believe that, on New Years Eve?
Every one seems to be positive and upbeat, but I can't. Not when I have been isolated for years. No family, no friends, no life.

I want somebody to talk to, because I can't tolerate it anymore. This isolation is making me want to cut myself more. 
I wish I had the guts to die, but at the same time, I just want to live a normal life. I want to see the light of day. 
Somebody, please. I am being torn apart.",4

"I have been taking Wellbutrin XL of varying doses since 2012. Within the last nine months, I've begun feeling like my blood sugar is low all the time, and I've stopped exercising because I felt like I was going to pass out afterward. Some days it's much worse than others. Numbness and tingling are part of it. 

My psychiatrist is cutting my dosage in half to see if the Wellbutrin is the culprit.

Has anyone else experienced this? It has been very upsetting to not feel good enough to exercise, but I'm worried about reducing my dosage. Wellbutrin is the medicine that brought me back from feeling suicidal in college. ",3
"I 'work' from home/mom's basement, before I start to work I go on a ride in my mountain bike, my thoughts are not negative at all but I start to feel like my thoughts are not normal or dont feel like it, I start to feel tired of this and hate my life sometimes",0
"dsAIm 18, about to be 19 in a month (Feb.1) and a male, if that matters. 

As im posting this its currently 11:50 PM right before the new year. Both my brother and my sister are out at seperate parties, while im alone in my room. I have no connection to my parents, i feel so alone on new years eve when everyone else is having fun. All my friends left for college and havnt kept in touch, and my only online friends are all increasingly harder to reach. I feel like i only push those closest to me away when i try talking to them about how i feel. I never go out and do anything, im either at home or work, and even though me and my brother are ""friends"" and his friends accept me when they come over, they never invite me anywhere, and i feel awkward asking if i can tag along. My mom rarely talks to me, my dad isnt good at being supportive (to say the least) my stepmom hates me one day and acts like were friends the next. When they try to encourage me to better myself its always in a degrading way, ""youll be 300 pounds if you dont change the way you eat, look at yourself."" ""You need to eat less"" ""youre a terrible driver"" things like that. Im not too fat imo but im not thin either, i have manboobs and i hate them, and i genuinely want to better myself, but its hard without support. For the past week or so ive just wanted to curl up in my bed and cry, and its only as im typing this post that im finally getting that release, i genuinely dont know where else to turn. I have an overwhelming fear of there being no afterlife and just nothingness after death that cripples me and keeps me awake at night which no one ive talked to yet acknowledges. I just feel like im in a shitshow and i have no one here to help me through it, and all i want is to be happy but it feels like that just isnt possible for me. Sometimes i think im happy for a bit, but i feel like ive just gotten so good at pretending that i even fool myself sometimes. All this is made worse by the fact that right before my friends left, for about 2 months i was genuinely happy, we all went out and did things and it was fun, but then they all left, and now i feel like that little taste of happiness only makes this pain worse because i know what true happiness feels like, and i feel like i can never achieve it again.",4
"All I can think about the girl I was really into, and how it came crashing down.. with a bad fight between us to end even our friendship. The warmth felt so good. It made me feel nice afterwards. but i can't get the thought of her dating someone else out of my head. ",4
"First of all, I firmly apologize if this is long.
I just got dumped and had my heart broken. AGAIN!
My life is so fucking bad, I really want it all to end. I never had ANY success in my love life. Any relationship that I would enter, I would just get heartbroken. I've been terribly depressed before due to my other break-ups, but more than one year ago, I met this beautiful girl (let's call her Sara) who changed my life. At the time, she was the only good thing to come in my life. She was always there for me, she'd comfort me when I'm not okay, she'd make me laugh, she was just THERE and that's all I needed. She told me she loves me so many times and always used to say that she'll be here always and forever. And I trusted her. We've been together for over a year and I really got attached to her. I love her so fucking much. Throughout December, I was looking back at the past few months and couldn't believe how good my life has become, just because of that one person. 
Tonight, she just told me that she has changed. That she has made new decisions for 2018, that she completely changed. She explained how her love for me is simply leaving, and that's it. I haven't done anything, I've always been there for her, I did my best as a boyfriend. She didn't let me say anything, to try and change her mind. It ended so fast.
My whole life got destroyed tonight. She was my whole life. And I know I'm not getting her back. I love her so much and I don't know what to say. I've spent 2 hours just crying, thinking and listening to some music. I feel so empty, my heart just fucking hurts. I'm just thinking of ending it all. On top of that, I have other problems - my mother is sick and I have financial problems. She made it better. She gave me hope. I'm tired of it all. The pain, the tears and despair. I don't even understand anymore; HOW CAN IT GET BETTER? I don't see any possible scenario of my life getting better. I really wanted to share, and I have no one so close to me to really vent out. I only have Reddit.
Thank you so much if you read through this, it means so much. I'm broken right now. I don't know what's gonna happen to me or what I'll do.",4

There's a lot of further background information that I'm too tired to get into. Suffice to say, this is extremely painful and I'm not taking it well.

"I don't know how to preface this. I guess, maybe, that I don't understand, and I am not understood. This is really shameless of me, to post. But here goes nothing.

Isolation plagues me, like, cancer plagues a person. I'm not comparing the grimness, cancer is terrible. But, I am comparing, how it's impossible to truly get rid of. Or at the very least, very very hard.

You see, communication, to me, is like trying to draw. In what way? Well, imagine you're drawing a wolf, but you're not good at drawing. So you think of a design, and in your head it works out, it looks amazing! Then, as soon as you go to put it on paper, it all falls apart and you end up crumpling the paper and trashing it.

Imagine, like that, but with vocal conversation. This is like, a giant wall, between me and anyone else. Nobody can get close to me. I can't get close to anyone. Nobody can even see me. I'm like a radio station broadcasting into the abyss.

*That's just who I am.* Nothing will fix that. So, I'm doomed, to loneliness and isolation. So is the way of life.

Not many people know what it's like to be that isolated. To be an alien among humans, to be, what seems like, the last of your kind. Everyone rejects you, because it's clear, you're not human. Your movements, the way you compose yourself, people can *JUST TELL*. And they avoid you. It's terrible, people get mad at you, scapegoat you, and you can't defend yourself on your own.

Since I was born, this is how it's been. The terror of a nightmare I once had, has slowly become an everyday thing. I'll attempt to explain the nightmare.

Here it goes : I was walking down a hallway. I was hit by sadness, isolation, stress. Not unusual. But then someone says something that throws me over the edge. I want to scream. I try to scream. I'm screaming. But there is no sound. I try to punch everything around me, and every punch lands featherlight, as if there was no intent behind it. I can't blow off anything, it's just fuming inside of me. I collapse hysterically crying(yet, not making a sound, even if I tried) and i awake with wet eyes.

It's the most terrifying nightmare I've ever had, yet, eerily reminiscent and metaphorical of exactly how I feel. Voiceless... It's so bad, I can't explain the isolation, I can't explain the loneliness, being someone so cold, yet, with so much to share, but you can't share it, and nobody will share with you. It's not fun, it's terrible, it's so bad and it's not something that can be fixed. It consumes me every single day.

It's not *just* the depression speaking. Legitimately, I have no chance of ever properly communicating. Do you know how that feels? Does anyone know how that feels? I'm sure they do, but that doesn't make it easier.

It's a stabbing pain, when, even people you've grown up with your whole life, you're not connected with. My mother means literally nothing to me. Nobody means anything to me, and I WISH THEY DID. God, I WISH THEY DID. It's hardddd though, I can't explain it. I'm trapped in a bunker nobody can penetrate. Nobody even knows I'm in here, so why would they try? They just assume that I am the cold, heartless, stone walls that encase me.

I could never explain it. That's what hurts so bad. The headaches, the pain. It's unbearable. I frequently dream about just shooting up a ludicrous amount of heroin and drifting into an endless sleep.

I don't want to live anymore, I want to be on the moon, where I belong. Maybe, just maybe, I'll be there soon. And I'll be sad for never.

Everyone has a sense of loneliness at some point, a yearning for belonging. For me, these are two facts of life, not temporary situations, just due to who I am. That's what hurts the most. Even if I  wanted something different, and I DO I DO, I could never fucking have it. It's so bad, its terrible, it's undefeatable.

It's not just a temporary state. Don't tell me ""it'll pass"". No it fucking won't, I'm not just saying that. It literally won't pass. It's not ""The depression speaking"". It is *LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE SHRED OF WHO I AM*. And nobody, will ever try to break through those grim walls. I'm just an emotionless enigma to them, people just accept it. I want to leave this lonely place. But I can't. It's a curse, an everlasting curse I will carry to the grave.

I'm getting a headache.",5
"Today has been the worst fucking day I've had in a long time without getting into details due to legal reasons.

I just end up hating myself because of these feelings and feeling even more detached from the world.   
Why do I have to sabotage my own mind and feelings?",5
"I am terrified.

I am terrified because something inside of me is broken. Even as I write this, I am overwhelmed, because it Is impossible to describe it. I do not know how to describe it. The closest thing to it is hell. It is a state when all of your worst fears come to life. When your paranoia is palpable in the air. 

It is the place, when you were a child, that you could never even conceive of. Perhaps when you had a momentary glimpse of it in your bad dreams at night, but then you woke up.  Now that you are older, you live in it.  Your life is literally a nightmare.

My mind has taken everything away from me. The bipolar disorder which came unto me in early adulthood destroyed my life. It took away all of my relationships and capacity to have relationships. It took away all of my hopes and dreams. It ruined my reputation and took away any career prospects.  The idea of being homeless, discarded, abandoned and left to rot is a very real thing that is facing me. There is no bottom. Even when you reach it, you just keep pushing yourself further down, wallowing in your own guilt. The only real support I have left are my parents, and I don't know for how much longer. I have caused them so much stress already. I have caused them to worry so much- how can one live with so many weights to bear on top of their original insanity?

I am in a place where everything Is dark. With feelings of inner death and hopelessness that make you want to crawl into a corner and cry.  The worst of it is the confusion. Knowing that you have tried everything, that nothing worked, and so you have no idea what you are even supposed to do anymore in life. Everything contradicts itself. Everything is a double-bind. Everything feels like a dead end, and every step forward feels like a step back.  So, you're stuck. Worse still, you have no one to blame but yourself, so that's what you do, and that's of no use either.

So you've become an expert in patience and endurance. You endure the shitstorm that is your reality. You grin and bear it, hoping it make it through another day.  You wonder how is it possible for a sentient being to be able to experience something so terrifying and painful. You also wonder what you did to deserve this- and if karma is real, then yeah, you deserve it.  There you are at it again- breaking yourself in, harder and harder.  Non-stop negativity, hostile and intrusive thoughts.  You don't want to be around others because it makes no sense. How could they be normal, have a sincere smile, and you are like this? It doesn't compute- it just hurts you more and makes you feel even more lonely.  So you live alone and isolated, and you wait it out. Minutes turn into hours, turn into days, turn into weeks, turn into months, turn into years.  Year after year goes by, and you experience some periods of normalcy or perhaps even joy, some success, but then as surely as the seasons alternate, your depression comes back stronger than ever as if on cue, and takes away any progress you have made.  It destroys any newfound hope you were able to cultivate and nurture.  It makes you once again cut off all ties, run away, and there you are again, once again cowering in your own little corner, your personal hell.

You hear all the naive New-Agers say âjust go for it!â, âcarpe diemâ, âyou only live once!â, âyou always have the choice to be happyâ ""you can always turn your life around""... and you know, it just breaks my mind even more.  They don't understand, and you cannot make them understand, that this is not how it works, not for you. No, I am not some victimized snowflake, but there is something broken in my brain, in my soul. Some of the buttons, some of the options you have, for me, they are disabled. I do not have these same options, and no, it is not just because I believe that. I could live in delusion and convince myself otherwise, but it would change nothing.  I'm just fucking doomed like this, you see?   Yes of course, that makes me the toxic negative person, as if I enjoyed it. Rest assured, I don't.  Oh and by the way, earlier on, I was able to turn my life around. I called on the help of some divine and holy miracle and relentless self-discipline and truly did turn my life around, but in the end, it never lasts. It always, without exception, gets taken away. Now, I am no longer able to call in the supernatural, the impossible. I can no longer will myself. 

It's something that we experience that most people don't. Perhaps they have had brief periods of hell, but not for as long as we do.  Every moment, I wish I were dead. I cannot kill myself for the typical reasons- it will hurt others and maybe, just maybe, there could be hope for something better one day, even though it may be inconceivable now.   

Personally, I'm really looking forward to the day of my death. Why? So that when I have my life review, I can finally know WHY?  Why all this pain, why all this suffering, for what?  I can look my guardian angel in the eye without any regrets and tell him: âlook motherfucker, I did the best I could. I tried everything. There was absolutely nothing more I could do. Don't you fucking dare tell me I could have been more âopenâ, or âlovingâ. I tore my heart out to find my inner love, but there was noneâ.

So then by whatever process, I would be made to know, to understand why, and I hope to God that if reincarnation is real, that my next lifetime could be normal and joyous.   So far as I can see it, I do not feel that this kind of pain and suffering could be anything other than a) a punishment or b) a test of endurance. I can say with complete confidence that I have not learned or benefited in any way from my bipolar disorder. If anything, it has caused and continues to cause harm to myself and all those around me, and the worst of it is that there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.    Happy new year.",3
"Just curious, as last year I have lost most if not all of my friends and in the New Year even my sibling has told me ""I don't want to be around negative people"" and proceeded to cut me out in all social platforms and in real life.

"2017 was a shit show. I sat in my room alone last night and watched the ball drop. Today I woke up still depressed. Just a reminder to anyone else struggling that nothing is going to change instantly for you just cause it's a new year, take it one day at a time. We'll be alright. ",5
"Hi all, 

I am a 20 year old male in college and I have been going through an especially hard time lately, so I wanted to share my story with depression and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. My hope is that my writing this out I can relieve some pain and maybe if anyone else is struggling with something similar they can feel comfort knowing they are not alone. I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 7 years old, after I got a strep throat infection I started experiencing symptoms of the disorder such as ticks (biting my shirt, blinking my eyes excessively, craning my neck a certain way a lot). I worried about little things, such as if there was a seam on my sock or a tag on my shirt, I would feel so much discomfort that I could not wear it. When I worried about things, sometimes I felt pains in either side of my body, if I didn't feel the pain in the other side of my body it felt wrong and the decision I made in my head felt wrong.

Anyway, my ticks got worse after taking a certain medication that I forget the name of, and then they got better after I got off it. I started having more rituals, like washing my hands and walking across mirrors multiple times to get it ""right"". This later turned into more obsessive thoughts, which are what I primarily suffer from now. I am not in therapy right now and I am not taking any medication. In high school, I feel like I was happier because I had a small group of friends and a best friend who was a girl that I loved. A year later, I did not talk to any of those friends including that girl because she did not reciprocate feelings and we stopped talking to each other soon after that. This was really hard for me at the time, she was so funny and genuinely nice I thought, she was absolutely beautiful and I took her to prom which was a shitty night because she ignored me most of the night. I ignored that red flag, and many others, I was 18 and I had never been in a relationship before and I fell for her hard.

After we stopped talking to each other, which was around December of 2016, I believe she texted me out of the blue in March of last year and we chatted a bit. That was all the contact we had until we saw each other at school when the semester started 4 months ago because she goes to the same college I do. It was good to see her, she told me she had a boyfriend that she broke up and he was an asshole, I had never met him. At the time I told myself that was okay she had moved on, I accepted that she was changing on and that I could move on too. I underestimated my feelings though because I ended up texting her and apologizing to her for whatever reason, and she apologized too. Things were well and good until I found out she had another boyfriend through a story she posted on Snapchat, and I freaked out. I blocked her phone number, Snapchat, Instagram and everything. I completely cut contact with her for 4 months. Until 2 weeks ago, and we had a great time recently as friends but she cut me off again and I don't know if I deserve it or not but it makes me feel bad of course.

I have a part time job, but it's not enough hours and I am going to see if I can't get more or maybe find something to do on the side. It makes me feel worse to not work or go to school and be around other people, I do not have any friends now, and I have been crying over something every day in recent months because of my depression. My family does not think I have depression, my mom has the key on the gate because she had postpartum depression and according to her that was real depression but not mine. I am just ""stir crazy"" from not working, and she is pushing me to get another job. When she says that to me it makes me feel invalid and worthless, which I feel like anyway pretty much anyway, I love her but I hate it when she makes me feel this way about myself. My dad does not think too much about my mental health, and neither does my mom's boyfriend.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my story with you all. It made me feel better to type it out as I have been having an extremely hard week. I was on a high because my best friend and I started talking again and spending time together 2 weeks ago, now she is ignoring me and I am not sure why. Now I have been crying just about every hour of every day and out of the past 48 hours I have probably slept through 20 of those hours. I hurt myself again and have been treating the wounds but they were stinging so bad sometimes. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.",4
"Why is it the two worst, most hurtful relationships lasted years, while the ones that feel that they have the most love and promise a real future fall apart in an eye blink.

"My own fucking problems aren't enough anymore. I've gotten so used to my shitty life and the thought of wanting to die that I can't cry anymore when I'm depressed. But crying helps.

It's weird. I know. And I kinda feel like thanking you but that would seem out of place since you're just here to find help too. I don't even know why I'm posting this here. I just wanted to tell someone and my friends don't give a fuck. ",4
"I've seen one before, and a psychiatrist, but every time I have only really been able to talk about the ""surface"" issues. I'm frightened of opening a can of worms I can't close. Any advice?",0
"SORRY....BUT IT IS!!!

Obviously, if you are so depressed to the point where you have such a low mood that you don't eat, sleep, shower, socialize etc - and you do this for weeks/months/years - then it stands to reason that this is certainly an abnormal way of thinking and you should seek help.

BUT......nobody ever discusses the opposite - people who are so peppy and happy ALL THE TIME to the point where it's obnoxious. I know (and knew) some of these people and it makes me sick. What make sme even more frustrated is that this isn't acknowledge as a mental issue, but it certainly should be!

When we are first born, we are crying. It is a human instinct to cry or feel fearful when we are endangered, just like it's a natural instinct to smile or laugh when we are pleased. 

But what pisses me off are these people that go around with these big smiles and hearty personalities ALL THE TIME. Nothing seem sto phase them or make them deviate from their ""norm""....death of a loved one, job loss, etc. They always see a silver lining so bright that it probably blocks out every other fucking colour to them. 

And what does the mental health profession have to say about this? Absolutely nothing!!! I'm sorry, but just because you are outwardly happy all the time doesn't make you exempt from having mental illness - in fact, I'd be willing to bet that there's a whole lot of repression going on inside that mind. But that would make this JUST AS BAD a s chronic depression. 

As much as I hate struggling with depression, I hate seeing people who are the exact opposite. Don't make me puke!!!

Do any of you guys know somebody who's like this?

"Throwaway account because this is fucking embarrassing and I don't want it on my real account.

"I'd like to preface this post by saying if it appears that I am trolling, I am not, but I realise some of these points may seem illegitimate. 

I watched frozen for the first time recently. Being a 20 year old man, I realised I wasn't in the target audience for it, but I watched it nonetheless as I had nothin better to do. As I watched it I found myself strangely entranced. I enjoyed this innocence of it but it was strangely alien to me, like I'd never experienced something like it before. It got me thinking about my childhood, which I've not long departed, and yet have rarely reflected upon.

I thought about how alien frozen was to me, and how I lacked anything like it when I was growing up. I was never shown Disney or Pixar films in my infancy, unlike, dare I say, most people my age. I summed this up to spending very little time with my mother due to her illnesses that rendered her incapable of caring for me in my formative years. Instead, I spent them in the care of my grandparents, who were very kind to me, yet it was not the same as having parents as my friends did. It wasn't until I was around 13 or 14 when my mother took over full time care of me, by which time it was too late for me to gather the classically happy childhood memories I feel I'm lacking. Even when she took over my care, she was not really the perfect mother, not for lack of trying but due to a lack of experience, (she had me when she was very young compared to the average). She couldn't afford to rent a particularly nice place to stay, in fact it was so run down that I was too embarrassed to invite friends over. Sometimes she invited friends for me by asking their parents, but I soon put a stop to that when I discovered they'd been talking about my house behind my back, commenting on how grotty it was compared to their middle class mansions in the suburbs. Times got so bad that, on multiple occasions, I remember being told to get on the floor and to be quiet whilst debt collectors hammered on the door in search of our meagre possessions to settle debts for necessities like electricity and gas.

I never knew my father either, in fact I didn't even know his name until about 2 years ago, when I found it out from my birth certificate. I then googled it and discovered he was a convicted paedophile which sent me into a downward spiral of self identity crisis. I always felt this lack of knowledge of where I come from. Friends who didn't understand would often ask me if I missed my dad or not and bullies who found out the information would often use it to their advantage.

I guess all in all what I'm trying to say is I feel unsatisfied with my childhood, but I was never abused, verbally or physically. I was never homeless or reliant on food banks, despite being close on several occasions. I was always taught to be grateful for what I have. Like that classic quote says, âIf you have running water and a refrigerator, you're better off than half of the worlds population.â I've always hated lines like that, I've certainly never felt better off, and even less so when compared to my peers. I quote that comes to mind is âI never wanted more than everyone else, just not the less I was used to.â I don't know if I'm being melodramatic or if I have legitimate reasons to feel cheated. I guess I'm just struggling with moving past darker days right now...

"   It's been a good break so far, as school is the source of most of my triggers for depression and I'm also in Florida which helps combat seasonal depression, but something's off. I just feel unsatisfied. Like, now that I'm feeling better, I'm seeing how bad I've been living. I see what I want to improve now, but it's overwhelming. I'm so close to having energy to take on these challenges, but right now I still hardly have energy to get out of bed. Any suggestions?",2
"I am M/16 and I suffer from depression. It all started when I was around 12-13 years old when I found out I was gay. 

I have friends that I can talk to but it just doesnt help me much.
In the last weeks my suicidal thoughts have increased by alot and anxiety and an uncomfortable feeling in my chest has increased too.
I just want to get comforted by someone (I would prefer my crush lol)

I dont want to sound desperate but is here anyone who can try to make me feel better?
My emotional pain has grown by alot recently and often times I just want to die but I cant kill myself because I dont want to hurt my close ones.
Please help me :(

Edit: Idk if anything Im writing makes sense but I just feel so hopeless and I kind of want to fight against it but most of the time I dont feel like I even have enough power to reach out for help and just let myself drown in my despair and pain. 

Can anyone understand me?",4

At midnight when we drinked champagne she didn't even looked me in the eye... Now I'm sitting in  my room crying and listening how she wants to throw me out of the house, how she is screaming at my father... I just see one way out...

"When I look at all the problems I have to face and all the issues I've got; my crippling anxiety issues, my huge insecurities about every part of me and my overwhelming jealousy leading to loneliness and isolation it all just seems impossible and pointless trying to fix it. It just seems so hopeless even thinking about how to solve these problems as they all seem so overwhelming and connected that no matter what I do they won't go away.

I cannot even think of a place to start with all this mess because every time I try and fix something I'm just reminded of how this other issue will still be there and it's like whenever I come up with a solution another problem arises. What's worse is how every time I do try and sort my life out and it fails, which is every time, I become even more disillusioned and deterred from trying again in the future, because it will just be pointless. 

It's pretty fucking depressing that the first thought I wake up to on the start of a new year is how it would be easier killing myself then hopelessly trying to fix my problems. I wish I could just be rid of all this shit and be a normal person, it's fucking scary thinking about how this is how I could be forever.",3
"I've been dealing with mild depression since October (self-diagnosed, nothing formal). I've mostly been able to deal with it. The last few months though, it's slowly getting worse. The lack of energy, loss of interest in enjoyed activities. All I do is work is come home. On the weekends, I just turn hermit and avoid things. Even doing self care doesn't help.

Today, I haven't been out of bed except to go to the bathroom and eat a bagel. My roommate came in to talk and see if I was okay. He had helped me in the past deal with this, but even he's not sure what to do.

In about 3 months, I'm supposed to move in with the love of my life. I'm moving to another state to do it. I know I need to start therapy, but I know changing therapists at the beginning of recovery can be dangerous.

I'm so lost that I just don't know where to start.",3

"It's bad. I'm a quiet person. But now I'm realizing that the only times I'm not quiet revolve around times I'm talking about things that are depressing, like my depression or ptsd. It's like I have no sense of humor or have no personality other than that. I'm trying to build one now that I realize that, like develop interests and such, but it's a slow process and I've never ever been good at making friends. It's like, to make friends, I have to put myself out there, but when I put myself out there, I just suck at it. I am not present. I question in my mind, what do I say, does this sound stupid, and I hyper analyze my and the other persons reactions and what they say and do. It's ridiculous. I have no self esteem. 

I'm 27 now, just recently got approved for disability, and feel like a loser. I have a few ideas how to meet people and rebuild my life, like a local place that offers drop in support groups or meetup.com but I just feel so lost. I haven't graduated college and my boyfriend of two years just broke up with me, and my whole social support network revolved around him. I'm not used to being on my own.

How can I make friends? I feel like I missed out on vital parts of life where you learn that :/",5
Here's to hoping this is the year Iï¸ finally have the guts to kill myself and end all of this,5
"I was wondering if anyone here ever decided to abruptly end taking their medication, specifically Wellbutrin. Some personal context, I was diagnosed in October of 2015, I had been on a variety of medication up until March of 2016 at which point I settled on Wellbutrin. I have been on 300 mg of Wellbutrin ever since.

I just finished my first semester at college, and over the course of the semester I have had some ups and downs. However, overall the experience has been a net positive. I made some great friends, enjoyed two of my classes, and didn't completely fail my classes.

In the last two months I noticed that my medication was having very little effect. Depression-wise, I have hit a plateau. I wasn't getting better, but I was also not hitting too many lows.

I started occasionally skipping days on taking my medication. Not completely intentionally, I would just put it off to later due to other priorities (studying for finals) and just end up forgetting to take it. I met with a new psychiatrist (from the college) with whom I discussed the feelings of hitting a plateau, and got a prescription bump to 450 mg (I didn't mention that I occasionally skipped days).

In the past couple of days, almost a week at this point, I haven't taken any Wellbutrin at all. I feel just fine.

Since I have had depression for almost year now, I forget what feeling normal is like. I can't tell if I am back to ""normal"" or if my current feelings are the ""new normal"".

I know I should (and probably will) talk to the psychiatrist about this, but I just wanted to hear some anecdotal accounts of anyone who has tried to go cold turkey with Wellbutrin. I would love to get off medication if I could, but I understand that such a rapid transition can be detrimental.",3

"New office job. Staring at spreadsheets all day, which I was fine with since it was in my comfort zone. Now they've assigned me something I only have a semblance of an idea about, but are acting like I'll be able to do an insane job. I said my knowledge of it was basic, BASIC BASIC. But they still want to see what I can ""do.""

I won't be able to do fucking anything. I'll be sitting infront of my computer wanting to kill myself, because I won't even figure out whatever they want me to do without Google every five seconds. I don't want to go in tomorrow, I want to quit working entirely. This is fucking painful.",2
"I'm 2 years away from graduating from medical school. Its been a long and painful journey that I feel has irreversibly damaged my mental health. I'm not the same person I was when I started and I don't know if its because of a past toxic relationship, school or something else. I originally went into it because I wanted to help people (bit of a cliche, I know) and I was interested in the human body. 

But now I don't know if its what I want to do. I can't focus on the work, I find it boring and I hate studying. I feel trapped and isolated. I don't get on with other medical students - I try to be friendly but the only way I can be around them is if I'm not myself. 

Increasingly, I've been drawn to the creative industry. I would say I'm quite stylish and love dressing up and coming up with outfits. There is this creative world that exists where everyone knows each other and I want so badly to be a part of it. 

The only thing is I have no skills, talents or even interests. There is nothing I love enough to work hard at. I read a post on here that said not everyone has actual talent (although, I feel like most people do) but they work hard. I've tried loads of different things but I never like anything enough to continue with it. I've tried sewing, dressmaking, painting, modelling and styling (I did actually really like modelling and sort of liked styling but got stressed out that the outfits I chose weren't good enough). 

More than anything, I wish that I was musical. If I could be anything it would be a singer or rapper or even producer. The music industry appeals to me so much - the thought of people who've never even met me from all across the world listening to music I've made and resonating with those words and appreciating my talent is amazing to me. No other job could give that. No other job is as highly renowned. Musicians have a legacy that is never forgotten. People admire them and their talent even after death. They stand for something and change cultures. 

But again - I don't have a musical bone in my body. I wouldn't even know where to start. Every musician (or anyone hugely successful in their craft) started from a very young age - I'm almost 25. I also don't have the time. I would feel very stupid trying to do it when I don't have a natural calling or even ear for it. A girl I used to know who is now a famous singer told me that if you were supposed to be doing music you would be doing music. Everyone who is successful naturally fell into that path and worked hard at it. No one randomly says 'I want to be a rapper today' (or an actor or a fashion designer) with no experience or talent and then becomes one. 

Not knowing what I want to do and not having any talents, or even anything I like a lot; on top of the pressures of medical school, which I'm struggling with, is making me feel trapped, isolated and depressed. I see a therapist. 

There are 16 year olds who have done bigger things than me and who have more idea of what they want to do and are working towards that. I wouldn't mind if I was at the early stages of something where I wasn't very good but still knew what I wanted to do and liked that thing enough to keep going with it. I have absolutely no idea what I would want to do and be ok at or become good at, with enough work (because I don't think I could ever be good at music). I know its not supposed to be easy but I thought at least having a dream or passion would come naturally. ",2
"This is my little story. 

2017 was one of the hardest years of my life. I rang in the New Year drunk and drugged out at a music festival in hope that my feelings of depression and anxiety could be steered away. The whole year I fought an internal battle with my mind every day. I saw each day of my life pass by. I woke up many mornings hoping I could go back to sleep and not wake up for a long time. I had days of some clarity, but my illness just got worse. I tried everything to cure my mental illness such as becoming more religious, finding new hobbies, going out more but nothing worked. My mind would be temporarily occupied but I still came home each night to my bed of sorrow and hopelessness. My bad thoughts not only affected me, but one of the most important people in my life, my boyfriend. He tried to help me. He became my therapist which later in time broke him. I ran to him every time I needed reassurance and love. And he surpassed my expectations of an amazing human being. But instead of this causing me to get better, I only got worse. My mind switched this and I began to question why I wasn't happy. How could I have everything in the world? (A roof over my head, healthy family and friends, attending an amazing college, and dating this awesome human being). I simply could not understand how I could be depressed. I began questioning my relationship. Began doubting my life, my identity, my ideas, my thoughts, and my feelings for everything. The doubting got so bad that I just became empty. I felt nothing. And this completely terrified me. I had seen myself morph from a happy, determined and cheerful woman, to a terrified, guilty, depressed and confused little girl. I had no idea why my life was falling apart. I saw myself deteriorate as the days, weeks and months passed. My life was falling apart and I had absolutely no control nor will to fight. I decided to end my relationship of 3 and a half years. One of the hardest decisions I had to make. Before my illness, I knew I was going to marry this person. Our relationship was no near perfect, but we loved each other so much. But now, how could I be selfish and be with someone when I didn't have my life, my feelings, or my issues figured out. For once, I understood the stupid cliche of âit's not you, it's meâ. My biggest fear of hurting him, had became a reality. My entire life completely fell apart from having a stupid thought that I labeled bad. I over thought this idea I had and it morphed into a fear, a phobia and a obsession in my mind. I simply wanted to be perfect for my significant other but I wasn't. I have my first therapy session with my new therapist next week, January 5th. I have hope that this time, I'm able to stick with it. I regret not continuing with my therapist when I first saw myself changing. I think, if only I had stayed in therapy, if only I had continued my medication, my illness would have not gotten so bad. I was a ticking time bomb and I just ignored myself. 

If you've gotten this far of reading my dumb post, please, I beg you, if you are going through some mental health issues, please get medical help. Please. It was one of dumbest mistakes I have ever made in my life. Please, listen to your body and your mind. I always took my mental health for granted and now I wish I could go back every day to a day of normality where I'm not struggling with my mind. ",3
"My fiancÃ© is the one who I talk to most about how I'm feeling and is the one who encouraged me to ask my mom for help, but I had no idea how to break the news to her. My whole life she has talked about how my dad was always so bad because he was bipolar and didn't take his medication so I always associated bipolar disorder to raging, abusive behavior and I'm not like that at all. I didn't want her to either belittle my feelings or freak out. Then one night I got drunk and I can't even remember how it got brought up, but I remember ugly crying to my mom about how over the past almost 5 years something has changed with me mentally and I've been having suicidal thoughts that have increased with time. I've always been depressed feeling and I self harmed when I was a teenager, but it was never like this. I think child birth triggered something because this all started with the intense sadness after having my first son (I'm assuming it was Postpartum Depression, but I never reached out. I was ashamed.) but the suicidal thoughts have increased over the past year and a half and I feel the shift in the manic and depression phases. Even my friends think I'm ignoring them because I go from chatty and outgoing to MIA for weeks.

(M/24/Appalachia)
Been depressed for over a decade now, and every year it's gotten worse. I feel like I am the subject of some cruel joke, a demented Truman Show, just tortured constantly in every aspect of life. Even the simplest tasks that people do, I have problems with. 



I am quite ill and have severe chronic pain (FAPs), but I can't get help because I live in the south and only junkies are allowed pain medicine here now with the new laws, and plus ""I'm too young to be so sick!"". I'm also a student but every year I fail half of my classes due to my illness or my severe crippling anxiety. The exhaustion is constant, and I don't have the mental or physical energy to do anything. I can't work either due to the same issues so I have no income, don't even have a bank account because I can't afford it. What money I do get I spend on cannabis for pain relief and so that I can keep food down (FGID). The pain really is crippling and I'm in tears from it 3+ times a day. I've waited 9 hrs in the ER, and I was still not seen by a doc. That's ""coal country"" for you, raped by corporations and then left to rot (//soapboxing)



I sleep about 3 or 4 nights out of the week (~4 hrs nightly), and have gone 6 days without sleep. Right now I'm on day 2. The sleep is never restful, I wake up about once an hour, the extreme pain creates these violent dreams where I am constantly getting brutally murdered. Takes me at least 3 hours to fall asleep, and I've spent 12+ hours laying awake in bed trying to sleep (I think that's why my joints hurt so bad.)



My psych is useless, he literally won't let me finish a single sentence and constantly berates me. He also refuses to treat me unless I take Paxil (his biggest sponsor) which previously led me to a suicide attempt and almost got me expelled from school (they thought I was on hard drugs). My psych didn't even have record of this suicide attempt even though I told them about it immediately. I've tried all the SSRI's and SNRI's and they all leave me worse than when I came in. I want to keep living and I'm afraid these meds will ensure that I don't. Sadly I can't switch doc's because the state pharmacy board will say I'm Dr. Shopping, being in WV they take it seriously. All of this together makes life like Chinese water torture. Drop by drop, day by day.



That's not even the worst of it, but I'll keep that one to myself for now or else some of you may think suicide *IS* a valid option for me! This event really gives me symptoms of PTSD though, but I don't self diagnose, and it puts a heavy load of regret on me I carry every day. Another deep regret I carry is from this: My good friend left from my house to a planned fight, which ended in my good friend using self defense and shot one of the men who was attacking. My friend just got 10 years for it, and I have so much weight on my heart that if I could have just stopped my friend from leaving he would still be free and this victim would still be alive. I think about it everyday. It really is torture in this poor tiny mountain town. This is as close to a 3rd world country in the US as it gets.

 

Socially I'm just as bad, heavily introverted. College is hell, I go to a small local campus of a bigger uni, meaning the class size is small. Forced participation is a nightmare, and there are no worse words to me than: ""Ok everyone, find a partner"" I end up alone every time. My every cough, every lead pencil broken, every sniff of the nose sends a wave a pure cringe through my body, even though I know it doesn't matter and no one cares. My anxiety gets so bad I have to leave class to puke, yet my psych sees no issues there. I find my self tailing friends at bars and if they leave I'm quietly in the corner awaiting their return. Comedy is my only crutch because physically I'm monstrous and have no self-esteem or confidence, I literally look like I have 2 black eyes ALL THE TIME. Tried all the creams and stuff but it's beyond help I think.



I don't expect anyone to have some magic solution but at this point I'm willing to try just about anything. I don't remember what it's like to be happy, and I'm forgetting what it's like to be human as well. Thanks for listening it really means the world to me.



Positives: I have an apartment w/ no rent, I'm good enough comedian to have a YT channel. Play guitar fairly well. Compassionate and empathetic to the point where it screws me over. Great w/ kids (studying Elementry Ed., no anxiety towards the kids, but if an adult is there too the anxiey is through the roof) I also don't really get social anxiety when streaming on Twitch (unless I've had a little too much ganja) perhaps the the screen being a barrier that blocks some of the anxiety, who knows.


Sorry for the novel, that's adderall for ya.



#TL/DR
24/m lifelong depressed (ex-selfharmer), uprooted to poor Appalachian town at age 20. Chronic pain and fatigue (untreated), crippling social anxiety, introverted. I need help. I need help. Thanks.",3
"Over the past few years of depression, my bedroom has begun to look like an episode of the Hoarders TV show... Thankfully without the bugs. Most of the mess was me just not doing laundry. My cleanliness standards were such that I didn't do laundry more than once a month, but still refused to wear dirty socks and underwear.

So, being the high functioning depressive that I am, I would frequently buy new socks and underwear as I ran out and febreez my jeans and shirts between washes.

The underwear took care of itself as I also gained a shit ton of weight and threw stuff out as it no longer fits, but...

This week I'm doing laundry. I'm trying to clean my room (ugh). I've done 5-6 loads and I'm still not done. I have so many socks I can fill an entire basket with *just* socks.

Has anyone else found themselves in this situation? How do you cope?

TL;DR: I kept buying socks while super depressed. Started doing laundry and now have a fuckton of them. Wat do.",2
"I am 22 and have never had a girlfriend and have been rejected countless times. I see couples all around me and I feel so depressed, like why me? why don't I deserve this? I feel like killing myself. I hate it when people say you don't need a relationship to make you happy because the people saying that have had relationships so they don't know how I feel. I don't kmow what to do?",4
"I was starting to feel low and burn out before New Years, and the evening allowed me to rise above my subjective perspective of myself and my interactions with people. I usually try not to party too hard *nudge nudge*, but it was a net positive I think. I reevaluated how I was doing and got a more complete view of psychological state.

I was also really happy to feel comfortable and actually see (as opposed to view a person through my preconceived notion) people a little more than I usually am able to.

Gender and Sexuality
===============
I grew up in a conservative environment, but I actually never felt ashamed of my gender or ashamed of my sexuality. I would get boy and girl crushes all the time and think nothing of it other than, ' oh this person is so cool and I really want to get to know them'. I was more effeminate and got bullied for it, including authority figures turning a blind eye or encouraging it. Pretty lame times that reinforced that people can be savage.

In expression and identity, I guess I was pretty androgynous growing. I never felt like I was a woman or that I wanted to be a manly man. I thought the gender binary people expressed themselves in was narrow and boring, so I kind of made a point to disregard it. 

Unfortunately, I have also learned that some people will not let you survive or function without expressing yourself in a way that they seem fit. I've experienced way too many people being openly hostile because of my mere existence. Today, I have to role-play as a bro just to survive in many professional environments. It feels degrading to my soul, but the trade off is I have some money. Its a bit emotionally exhausting and doesn't feel nice.

All in all, I am bi and not too happy with the prejudices people have in the world.


Socialization
==============
I am used to compartmentalizing my feelings. I have lost a great deal of friends who had either fallen off the face of the earth, OD'd, killed themselves, or had been too much grief to keep in contact with. I am craving close relationships and self-growth, but I am finding it difficult to meaningfully connect with people. I wonder if the feeling of abandoning other people because it is easier than being abandoned comes into play for me right now. I've felt that way in the past, but I thought I got over it. 

I am going to school and have had gainful employment, but it doesn't help me connect in the ways I seek. I socialize and feel like I am role-playing. Many friendships with people seem superficial and unfulfilling, and these are typically with normalish people. I don't have a problem putting myself 'out there' if I'm not down and out in a low period. I am social and have been told I am easy going and funny just as often as I've been told I can come across as a bitch without intending to or even saying anything (hah).

Despite what other people seem to think, I usually feel on-guard and can hardly be intimate / open up to folks. I think my memory is eroding due to long-term stress. What good is living life and collecting lessons from experiences if you can't remember them? What good is gaining perspective if you just lose it in a time of need? 

I'm uneasy not knowing people's motivations. I try to learn about people and what they want from me in an attempt to predict what may happen. 


Relationships
===============
I don't feel like I need to be in a relationship, but I do know that I need meaningful relationships. Although, it would be nice to find someone romantically that sees me for who I am and empowers me. Obviously, I have my doubts that I'll let anyone close enough to get the chance though.

Current partner was raised by a narcissist and is emotionally unavailable in a similar way as me. It is a comfortable yet emotionally unfulfilling relationship. I guess we're together out of a mutual need for physical intimacy and care? We care for each other, and she's incredibly gifted and into really cool stuff. We both value our space apart too due to similar issues.


The abridged version of my life:
================
As a child, I was very depressed due to life circumstances out of my control. Many of the relatives that I was close to straight up died, moved away, or quit speaking to me due to my parents' issues.

My parents made very unwise mistakes, fought often, and were not emotionally empowering. Purposefully went out of my way to not pick up their habits. Kind of felt a low-level mistrust of people since childhood due to bullying from other kids and abuse from authority figures. I liked books way more than people and read a lot. Most of my role-models were dead white guys haha.

High school was better, smoked weed and did somewhat engaging things with friends. Urban exploring, clubbing, extracurriculars, art, etc.

In spite of my world sucking, I was pretty motivated to leave and made decent grades. I qualified for a bunch of academic scholarships and went overseas. Found out the home was being foreclosed and the cars repossessed about midway through my year abroad. Traveled as much as I could and tried to not think too hard about returning to a state of no opportunities. Kinda spiraled into depression after realizing how good I was living abroad and how I would likely not see my new friends again.

At 16 I was thrust out into the world alone, ended up with little to no social supports or family due to my sexuality. It was also easier for my parents since they were struggling to get back on their own feet. Went around with a traveler friend I had made, riding trains and getting into trouble. Watched my travel buddy die of a heroin OD. Wound up in an abusive relationship on the coast. Pimped by someone older than me that I had been dating, experienced extreme stress and trauma due to some pretty bad influences in my life and feeling like there was no way out.

Eventually distanced myself from most of these horrible people, but I went through a period of agoraphobia where I wouldn't leave my apartment even if I ran out of food. Routinely disassociated and felt unable to connect to people.

Went on anti-psychotics for treatment resistant depression, basically strung out of my mind on benzos most of the day. Ditched the psych-meds and started meditating, doing shrooms, gradually meeting people. Got somewhat better, but I lost memories and cognitive functioning as a side effect of the anti-psychotics and benzos. Eventually returned to baseline (I think). Enrolled at a nearby school.

Started dating a guy who was diagnosed with NPD and in the marine corps. At first, his confidence and arrogance was endearing, and he was on frequent deployments which meant that we really valued the time we had together. Felt like I had a home for the first time in my life and actually loved. He was emotionally withdrawn, and I was also emotionally messed up to an extent. It worked out well enough. Was making a decent amount of money doing online stock trading and investing as well as taking classes online.

We would talk about our perspectives of the world. Goals. Ways to achieve our dreams. I designed our apartment and basically took care of his cats. Although I paid half the rent, I was kind of like expected to be a live-in nanny which wasn't too weird considering the shit I had gone through in life so far. He was a dom and we were both poly, so he would date basically my female-equivalent clones and we'd have threesomes (I would usually have shortish platinum blond haircuts and so would they). FWIW the sex with him pretty great even though he was kind of a sociopath.

After his contract with the military ended and he felt somewhat aimless, he began to cycle through emotions quickly and decided I wasn't worth his time. Literally a week after professing an extreme amount of love for me that he never felt before. He once described loving people like he would love eating a candy bar. That I had never done anything good for him. Really felt mind fucked - this wasn't a naive first relationship sorta deal. I even went with him to meet his parents once. It seriously felt like a deep relationship up until that point. 

Moved with friends to the bay, so did he. After a 6 month period of lackluster dating, we began an on and off again fuck-buddy relationship with that same guy. We agreed it would be purely physical, but he was trying to cross my boundaries. Eventually, I asked him to stay out of my life entirely. He told he had raped me after I passed out from GHB one evening bwfore either of us moved to the bay. I remember the incident vaguely, but I never opened my eyes and so just left it up to being something I imagined. Really screwed with me.

Best friend at the time was dating my partner, they ended up doing meth and being dicks. I cut them out of my life after they stoles from me. Not so funnily enough, my current best friend is being weird with my current partner - has been rejected by her and feels dissatisfied in his dating life. I feel like there is resentment being directed at me  and things are compounding on top of it. Too emotionally stressed to deal with it, so I am giving him space for awhile.

Had a crazy housemate situation where a couple made living at my space unbearable for me and 3 other housemates. We were all on the lease and couldn't evict them. I was stressed 100% of the time and never knew what they would do next. Can't really relax there even though they've been gone.

I am ashamed of what I have been through, but I try not to blame myself entirely for my life circumstances. A life without self-expression and enjoyment isn't a life worth living. I am sick of only surviving. I know something is wrong, but I don't have the tools to identify and fix it.

I've seen 6 different therapists - all ended up being useless, clueless, or offensive. Struggling to find a quality low income psych or therapists, but I am asking around.


*My living situation is tenuous and there is no long-term guarantee of housing. I also live in an extremely expensive area, and I don't have any social supports outside of here. Kind of feel trapped by this. 


Current thoughts
==============
I don't want to live a fear based lifestyle. 

I'd like to think that with all of my life experiences and trauma, I am not a complete basket case. I think I work much harder than most people to hold myself together. My worst fear is that I will become an emotionally reactive monster and permanently lose sight of the humanity of others. That my ability to rationalize and integrate my experiences will be lost forever. That I will be a scared, closed off, zombie for the rest of my life. It's really unnerving.

I've made so much progress over the last 5ish years to reach a point of relative stability, but it doesn't seem to be enough. I can't continue to expend so much energy on getting by. It's chipping at my will to live. With that being said, I'm not planning to make rash decisions. 


Some problems I have
==============
*Moody

*Typically pretty tense

*Tend to feel a level of stress at all times

*burn out after period of high stress leading to being withdrawn / unmotivated

*Have to fake being relaxed to interact with people in high stress periods (lots of projects, midterms/finals, relationship stuff)

*Memory is worsening

*Sometimes memories are hard to put in chronological order, not impossible - but it takes actual effort to piece together

*Sleep not restful

*Expect the worse from people, but I try to give them opportunities to prove me wrong 

*Sometimes impulsive when depressed, but I work pretty hard to control this - used to be caught up by by life's wayward distractions instead of introspecting 

*Sometimes experience anhedonia

*ADHD may be related

*Funnily enough, I don't feel safe being emotional around people sometimes",1
"I experienced intimidation at school, and my story will undoubtedly be different from what you have read in the past.

Because I am psychopathic by definition - diagnosed by few psychiatrists - what I have learned from that encounter will help you see intimidation from a different perspective.


**The story**

When I was younger - in high school - two famous guys from the volleyball team tried to bully me.

They would laugh at anything I would do, and others followed;  most are easily influenced because of a lack of critical ability, after all.

They cursed, started rumors, and shouted insults to make sure the others and I heard them.


**Indifference**

I have learned a lot from these episodes. I have watched them go through all kind of emotions, and it was easy to see they needed to fill a void.

My utter and complete indifference made it worse.  I did not give the attention they were seeking so severely. I witnessed their behaviors toward me without any concerns; I was only interested in learning more about human interactions.

You can learn from every experience in your life, good or bad, only if you take the time - and the required energy - to interpret why the reasons the experiences happened.


**The crowd**

At that time, I expected they would go further with their intimidation - after all, they had not gotten what they wanted; and they did not disappoint.

The larger of the two guys got physical - he had to - words were useless. From my perspective, and judging from his facial expression, it seemed like he pushed me as hard as he possibly could. Then, my back hit the wall, and I fell on the floor right after.

What followed was phenomenal. Everyone that I could see from my vantage point stopped talking. They had that dramatic look in their eyes; they were eager to see how I would react.

Fantastic, because it was a real representation of how limited most humans are. What happened is unquestionably unacceptable in the eyes of the majority of people - and yet - only one person, out of almost fifty, reacted with what looked like genuine empathy.

The rest did not move an inch to help. They watched, anxiously awaiting what was going to happen next. Some out of fear, but the vast majority were just thrilled to witness a possible act of violence.


**You are in control**

What I have learned, and still find useful to this day, is that nearly everyone you encounter in your life is not worth your time, and even less so, your energy. Even if they're not, you need to be respectful with your entourage: it's a necessity to thrive in any society.

You are in control of who you accept in your inner circle; thus you have the courtesy of choosing wisely. From my experience, only one out of fifty should be considered investing your time with.

It was out of the question I would react the way they expected it - I had to see how they would respond if I didn't do anything. Thus, I got back on my feet and continued on my journey.

They didn't cross the line because I still had to learn. I required a code to make sure I could live socially - it is the interpretation of these experiences that would allow me to build its foundations.

That one person who stood out of the group, and who later explained everything to the authorities - made me realize she was worth investing the time.


**You are the strong one**

If you are bullied, feel intimidated, and/or rejected: it is imperative you realize, right now and from now on, you are the strong one. The ones who intimidate you would never be able to withstand - even for a second - what you are going through. 

They are weak, and unlike you, they don't have the strength to control their most elementary feelings. It is fundamental to understand that very few people have the tenacity you possess. You have an attribute that makes everything achievable: self-control.

When you think about it, is there anything else you can control entirely besides yourself?


**The necessity to talk to someone**

It is useless to let these bullies intimidate you one more time. Use your strength, which very few possess, but you do. Remember to talk to someone about it. Take the time to look around you - it is mathematical - there is one person out of 50 in your entourage who will be worth your time, who is willing to listen to what you have to say, and who is going to stand up for you.
It is your responsibility to give that opportunity to that person. Use your strength to talk to someone and share how you feel; you will be surprised how much it will help.

You also have to acknowledge you are not alone. Others feel the same and are enduring the same situation. While all situations are different, inevitably, the solutions are all alike.

To those who intimidate, you are weak, and your actions are only a representation of your lack of confidence in yourself and a clear illustration of how low your self-esteem is.

One good start for you to display real strength - let's face it, you need it - is to apologize. If you still believe that intimidating others is a display of power, try the opposite.


**We want to hear your story**

You are all welcome, whoever and wherever you are, to share how you feel and what's on your mind with all of us, in a place where respect is fundamental.",4

I only have one more year to go, but I don't plan on doing a post graduate in the same course. How do I tell my parents?

"Honestly 2016 has been a pretty shit year. Being a gay 17 year old, with no father, moved halfway through high school and stuck inside his own mind with depression is awful.

Lately I just feel like I have no friends or value in this life. Everyone who I thought I was close with no longer speak to me and Idk what I've done. I'm stuck in the middle of Nebraska too. I'm from the northwest and I'm stuck in buttfuck nebraska. I just feel so alone and worthless and I just wish I had someone to talk to and I just wish I loved myself cause I've hated myself for the past 7 years and not a day goes by that I don't overly criticize myself. Honestly it's new years and I wish a drunk driver would hit me",5

But with my apathy and past mistakes, I feel I may lose both soon.  It sucks because I'm around people who are depressed because of their situations. And here I am depressed because of who I am and what I've done. Not looking for advice, just needed to put this somewhere.",4
"I recently (6 months ago) finally got a job after over a year of unemployment but im working huge hours and 6 days a week. Not only that, its a stressful job too. I find my self already not getting out of bed when my alarm wakes me up and considering just not going in ever again. I'm just wasting my time on facebook, youtube and reddit instead of doing productive things or even consuming media that enriches me. I dont want to stop working because i can finally afford to go places with my friends when i have time and i can finally buy things that i like and can pursue hobbies that in the past i couldn't afford too. Its not that im not making enough money, i could still do all this on a part time job but its been impossible for me to find one. I just have no idea what im doing, i feel my self slipping back into the attitude of helplessness, indifference and guilt toward my own life that not two years ago had me in a serious rut where my health and opportunity just wasted away, i finaly have the chance to live my life and i can feel all motivation to strive to enjoy it slipping out of my grasp every passing day.",2
"I feel as if though I'm the only one has it right. I know that people should love each other. Yet people don't. No one treats anyone with respect.

"I've struggled with depression for most of my adult life. I'm only 29 but sometimes I get these feelings of complete hopelessness. It can happen at any time, even when things are going really well.

"People are luckier than me.  People are more social than me.  People live more spendy lives than me.  How and why??

I have a co-worker who makes the same that I do.  He has a girlfriend, his own place, motorcycles, a truck, takes his girlfriend to dinners.  All on the same pay rate as me.  I barely get by with rent to my parents, food, and miscellaneous things that I need to live.  How the fuck does he do that?

Someone I know had a nice car.  Sold it for a good chunk of change, and turned around and bought it back a few months later for cheap as fuck.  How the fuck does he do that?  How does he find stupid suckers to sell a car to that'll turn around and give it back to him for cheap.  Essentially just giving him fucking money?

I'm poor, I'm lonely, I'm broke despite living with my parents.  What the fuck am I doing wrong.  My college degree hasn't done shit for me other than get me 25k in debt with piling interest.  ",5
"It's been almost a month now of consistent terrible break outs, and I don't know how much more I can take on myself. I look in the mirror and feel absolutely disgusted with what I see. I dread waking up in the mornings as I can feel a new pimple or bump on my face that wasn't there when I went to sleep. I have lost myself to acne completely, and it's ruining my life. I take a shower, and don't want the mirror to show how inflamed and disgusting my face is. I just want a normal face color. I'm tired of browsing routines, regimes, diets, medications, products, birth controls because it all feels helpless. I just feel as though I am a lost cause. Acne isn't the problem making me depressed, it's my reaction to it. I can hardly remember a time when I felt confident without a full face of foundation. I feel as though I'm fighting a losing battle everyday as I will take it and tell myself it doesn't matter, but the majority of the day it's all I think about. I've become obsessed with it, because I want it to be gone. It makes me feel âunhealthyâ and unattractive. I think when people see it, they think there is something wrong â making me ugly.

 As much as I love my boyfriend, and I know how much he loves me, I can't help but letting this skin disease and my mind tell me I'm not worthy of him because of it. He should be with a girl who has a flawless face, who doesn't go to sleep with spot treatments on her face, and wakes up crying about a new cyst that formed overnight. He deserves to wake up to someone who can roll over and smile confidently at him knowing that she isn't covered in disgusting cysts and pimples. He should have a girlfriend that doesn't have breakdowns about how I feel, and how disgusting I look; essentially having to talk me down all the time. It's a burden and it's annoying, he should not have to deal with it. I don't want to tell him or anyone how I feel, because no one should have to deal with a depressed person; he should have a fun, outgoing person. (The person I was before acne took over my life) It makes me feel unworthy of having children, They would deserve a mother who doesn't hate the way she looks and feels depressed because of it. How could I possibly have children when I feel and look like this? I feel like my nephew deserves an aunt who doesn't let these things affect her, a better aunt than I am. I even feel as though I don't deserve my dog, she is so good and pure and I'm so depressed and self-hating. My dog makes me so happy, but I even feel unworthy of her love.  I am starting to hate myself, which I really had never done before. 

I know people say it doesn't define you, but I'm letting it define me. I know people they don't care about it, but they have to. It's become severe, and I can't do anything currently to stop it. I've sunken into a deeper depression every day, I'm having a hard time enjoying myself with anything anymore because of how profoundly unhappy this makes me. I know it's something internal, but what more could I do. I feel as though I've tried everything except Accutane, which is going to happen at the end of this month due to the waiting period. I was told all hormonal birth control essentially balances your hormones, so I don't know if the birth control I've been on for 5 years is hurting or helping; but I've had acne before starting it. I tried Spiro, which caused more and more breakouts for 8 weeks.. I've been on antibiotics for 6 years or so, and they have finally stopped working. I'm happy to start Accutane, maybe it will give me a new lease on life. Or maybe I will be back where I started. I can't take this anymore, every day I feel closer and closer to the ledge.. I know this sounds dramatic, but I cry about this all day and night and think about it 24/7. It's driving me insane. I've tried to distract myself, but I've had a hard time doing that lately. 

I wasn't sure what sub to post this on. I guess I just needed to say something to anyone.

"So I would like to say when it started but my memory is of no use, since I only remember a few things, it is not short term memory though (it's not that bad), apparently it has do with my brain only remembering thing it thinks important. Any way, I am not depressed but many of you guys have similar problems based on some posts I have seen. Here is my reasoning behind this feeling, most people I know or have met when I was smaller said I was really charismatic, outgoing, etc but that I changed all of a sudden what I can guess was when I was around 6-7 based in the few memories I have. I became serious with out any sign of change and now I don't care about anything, but mean absolutely anything it is what can only be described as ""detached"". It could have been from suppression of who I am since that age because of people having expectations for me resulting in me not developing any real hobbies/interests  and knowing how to express my likes/dislikes or due to some other events that led me to suppress myself. Anyway that's my guess but I still don't know why I don't care anymore and how to move forward.",5

It's just the person is special and I'm not, and if I lose her as a friend then I'll never find someone like that again. I don't blame her, I bring all my problems to her and she's deeply caring but I think that's just the way she is.

"I'm considered by close friends to be a calm and happy person. I never actually lash out on anyone. When I hang out with people I would say I am pretty fine.

Then when I am alone, I get these intense feeling of anger over miniscule and insignificant things. Things like someone making a mean joke at my expense a long time ago, if they said/did something that made me shut down, or that time my roommate made a mess and I had to clean it up.

These incidents can be months old and resolved, but they keep repeating in my head and I find myself getting increasingly angry. It got a bit better when I was on antidepressants (Citalopram) but I decided to get off them due to side effects. Does anyone get this? How do you deal with it?",4
"I've been on antidepressants for around 4 or 5 years, but I'm still a mess. I have no control over my emotions, my panic attacks and general anxiety lead me to ruin friendships and relationships, I have fits of rage that also lead me to say things I don't mean but obviously can't take back, which has made me a very lonely person because no one wants to be around someone like that. I don't blame them. I lost someone that I really really love because of all this shit. It's hard on my parents, it's been hard on the people around me and that's why they leave. I've ruined so many things that I can't fix.

I hate my school. I love what I'm studying but the program at my school for it is a joke. All of the people in my program are annoying, I don't really like them. This past semester though, I started hanging out with them occasionally out of loneliness. That's not a good foundation for friendships.

This past year I've done a lot of growing, I've realized how shitty of a person I am, how selfish I am and how I've ruined every good relationship and friendship in my life. I still have no confidence, I'm still constantly paranoid, I'm always worried about my family members dying or something. I live 400 miles away from my childhood home. I have no friends where I live. My parents don't believe me when I say I have no friends. My mom says ""that's not true,"" and my dad just mocks me. Everything has gotten worse since starting antidepressants. If I hadn't started them, my anxiety and depression wouldn't have become a ""thing"" and everything would have been fine.

So this year, my goal is to get off antidepressants. So I'm going to do that. But where do I go from here? How do I take care of myself? How do I rebuild my life? How do I make friends? I need to start my life over, but how? I've ruined so much of my life. I'm not suicidal, I could never do that to my parents and my sisters and my family. But I feel so hopeless.

"Hi, I'm in my senior year in high school, and I need help with my girlfriend. While I currently do not have depression, she does. One thing that worries me the most is her pessimism. Sometimes, there will be a situation that she is not looking forward to (for example, she is getting her wisdom teeth out tomorrow), and she gets incredibly down and grumpy about the situation. I have told her that it will be ok and that I'm here for her, but she continues to rebut with ""I'm being logical and I'm correct that it will suck"". How do I help her? Obviously she is right and it will suck (I've gotten my wisdom teeth out so I'm definitely aware of the pain), but she still gets really depressed and pessimistic about everything. What do I say? I've already introduced the idea of therapy and she definitely did not like that, so as of now, I'm at a loss as to what to do. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

But ever since 7th grade I felt..different. (I'm in 8th now) now I know it's only been a year and a half but still...it's been too long. I've never felt this way. I can barely go to school because of how much I feel hated. Mostly I hate myself. I can't walk through the halls normally, I can't without thinking at least 5 negative thoughts about myself. Getting off the bus gives me so much anxiety I could cry. I've stated this before in my recent posts. Coming up to my stop today I had a panic attack. I tried to control it, but I still feel like people knew something was up. Maybe they didn't..I'm probably just paranoid like usual. Maybe it's stress...I've been stressing over my grades lately and trying to find out who I am. I don't want to disappoint anyone. I just want to be able to love myself again. I hate feeling the way I do. Please...what can I do to feel comfortable in my own skin? ",2
I fucking can't do anything anymore. I wake up at like 2 every fucking day. Stay in bed until 5 or 6 until my mom yells at me to get out of bed or something. I  need to study except I can't. I open a book and just stare blankly at a page. I study for 10 minutes and then I am done. I am too lazy to clean my room or open my curtains. I can't even do the simplest things anymore. Depression is fucking killing me slowly. I hate it. I hate it so badly. How can I fix this. I can't fucking fix this. I just want to fucking crack my skull on a pavement. I don't know why I am even typing this. Hoping someone will have an answer on how to fix this. But how can anyone fix this shit. It is so fucking complex. I need to work. I need to do well in my exams. I hate competition so badly. I wish I was never born.,3
"The depression is back again with a vengeance this time. I have been having health issues with no success of them being fixed after seeing multiple doctors.  My friends know I haven't been well and yet don't really seem to care to reach out to me in the last 3 months.  I spend half my time crying because I want to just die.  I don't want to commit suicide because I will be forever known as selfish.  At least if a car hit and killed me I could escape from all of this and not have any guilt about leaving my family.  My boyfriend can't handle it anymore and is leaving me.  He left me alone NYE as I went to the emergency room for excruciating pain.  He decided to go to a party and get hammered.  He didn't once ask me how I was.  I can't afford anymore therapy, my insurance is garbage and doesn't pay enough.  I guess I have to be a zombie on medications now.  Thanks for reading this rant. I'm just lost and lonely and needed someplace to share my feelings.",4
"but the voices, they don't stop. They tell me to kill myself every time I achieve anything and I am exhausted. I have goals and dreams, but whenever the wave comes I am reduced to nothing. I'm worried one day I'll give in.",3
"I'm approaching 28 and I think I've hit my lowest point of the last five years. I've had my issues for as long as I can remember. Particularly after my dad died in my early teens. Things just never really made a whole lot of sense to me. I don't think I ever really understood the concept of school, y'know? I get that it's supposed to prepare you for life, but it all just seemed like something I had to do so I wouldn't be bothered. Even in my senior year, I never really dreamed about ""being"" anything. 


Jumping ahead to where I am now, I've essentially done warehouse work off and on for the last 6 years. I quit my last job this November, and I'm pretty sure my family and room mate are pissed at me for it. I'm not really the type to talk about my feelings and all of that face-to-face, so I basically told them that I couldn't deal with it anymore. What really happened was that it was night-shift, and it was something that I hated. The one thing I've come to know about myself is that if I'm feeling depressed, lack of sleep will completely mess me up. The night I resigned, I spent the first three hours of my shift trying to keep myself from breaking down and crying in front of a group of strangers. The kicker is that I don't even really have a good reason for it. I think being there and being exhausted and doing nothing meaningful just kept building up this creeping fear that my life had no meaning. Had nothing to do with the job at all.


I was looking for work without much luck up until this point. I've been doing some online work here and there, but I suspect it won't be enough to keep everything going so I've essentially just started applying anywhere now since I'm going to start feeling the financial strain soon.


The people you get to know in blue-collar jobs are pretty straight-forward. They look at jobs and productivity, and will jump at the chance to call someone lazy if they aren't working as hard as them. I think that's what keeps a lot of these guys going, working dead-end jobs they hate. They get into this mindset of self-praise for the hard work that they do. And how they work harder than Guy B. And how Guy C is a lazy POS. So on and so forth. My room mate got very angry at me for quitting recently. He essentially said I was being lazy and I haven't had a stable job and a long time and I should be more like him. We met at a previous job and he's been there for almost 4 years now. The problem with his argument, in my mind, is that he hates it too. He's always trying to leave early or take off. And somehow, even at my worst, I seem to do better financially than him. Don't get me wrong, this post isn't to rant about him. It's more about the criticisms the people around me have.


And I suppose it would be unfair to say that I'm NOT lazy. I don't enjoy doing things that I hate, in what seems like a fruitless cycle of ""work to live, live to work"". That's not an argument you can make around these people though. I guess I would have to come out in full disclosure of how fucked up I am, otherwise I'm just being lazy.


Reading through all of these job descriptions recently makes my life seem more and more bleak. I just don't get how things seem to make sense to everyone around me, but it just won't click in my head. People will work near a decade doing something they hate but continue the cycle. On my end, I've just entered this ""numb"" feeling where I'm convinced that I'm never going to understand any of it and I should just be looking for peace from life itself.


I don't really know what I expect to hear from a post like this. I just felt like I had to share it with someone before I snap. Can anyone relate, or have general advice?",2

"I'm 21 years old and a complete and utter disappointment to those around me.

I dropped out of high school in grade 10, I couldn't do it anymore every day the pressures of school and a teacher who graded me differently than everyone else caused me to be physically ill. Every single day I'd use a friends phone and call my mom  sobbing to come pick me up. I was out of school more than I was at school at the point juggling my mental illness and fighting extreme stomach issues that ended up being gastroparesis. Dropping out feels like the worst decision of my life. My family treats me like I'm faking all my issues in order to get out of my responsibilities. When in reality I've been fighting as hard as I can. Juggling financing myself through my art, being homeless, and the crushing weight of my illnesses.

Everyone seems mad at me. My psych office has me on probation for missing too many appointments. If I keep missing them I'll be kicked out and left without my medication. I've been clean from self harm for probably 8 months but lately when I look at my scars all I can think about is doing it again. I don't have time to go inpatient and the suicidal thoughts keep getting worse.

I have people who love and support me but I still feel like I'm letting them all down. I don't know if my family will accept me because of my transition. I haven't told anyone but a few but I'm positive my older brother outed me to everyone and I'm too afraid to face them now. Im not ashamed of being trans but I am afraid of losing the last of my family.

I can't hold a job because of my PTSD. I can't keep friends because I don't think I'm good enough for them and my BPD just makes it harder to connect to people. I'm avoidant as fuck and all I want to do is shed all my mental illnesses and not have to feel this way anymore.

I've failed trying to kill myself. I've failed academically. I've failed friends. I've failed my therapist. I've failed myself.

What's left when nothing you do is good enough?",5
"I remember being carefree and happy as a child, now I dread every day due to being alone, being in my house 24/7 and having no one to talk to (doesn't help that people seem to drop out of conversations and forget I exist). As someone like me whose nearly 20, this is a joke. I lack motivation and fail to be up to standard like every person should be at this age. If only I could be happy for at least a month or two, hell give me an entire year depressed free.

"Lately I've been panicking over the realization that I'm dumb as a brick, and I haven't achieved anything in my life. 

I'm 20 years old and just got my first girlfriend. I guess this is the only major achievement of my life, as she is beautiful and smart. Amazed we actually connected. I constantly have a feeling she's going to leave me due to the fact I can't keep up with her. She has achieved so much. Scholarships, awards, friends, and more. 

I did nothing in my life. My teen years were spent playing videogames. I did anything and everything I could to waste time and make my life go by faster, because I assumed I'd be happier when I got older. Unfortunately I've realized that I should have used that time to train my brain and focus on grades/academic achievements. 

Now I'm as dumb as a brick. I have no career direction. I don't think I'd ever be able to work in a field that makes serious money. I still don't have any friends other than one online friend, and my girlfriend ( who has many real life friends ). I've never had any real life friends. 

I don't know what to do. My brain is already fucked. My memory is so bad. I feel like I've lost the ability to learn.  Once she realized I'm destined for failure, she's going to leave me. Then I'll be truly alone again. She already knows I'm not smart. ( not sure why this hasn't scared her off yet ) 

I can't take it. I hate feeling inadequate all the time.

"I posted about an hour ago in r/relationships about a situation with my roommate where he owes me $1000 in unpaid debt, and I told his mom about it when she came to visit.

Most people sided with me, and told me I was right to do what I did. This was a great boost of confidence, and I finally felt certainty in my actions after all the apprehension I've felt while dealing with my roommate's failure to pay his bills. 

Tonight, I decided to tell my Mom, Dad, and sister about my decision, certain that they would finally side with me and praise me for doing the right thing, and being assertive. I know that in the past they have sympathized with my roommate, but I wanted them to see once and for all that I'm not the bad guy for wanting to take him to court, or to tell his parents about the massive debt that he owes me.

Their reactions were...not good.

My mom buried her face in her hand and said, ""You *really* shouldn't have done that.""

My Dad fell silent, and didn't say anything. He had a look on his face that said, ""You fucked up"", though.

I started rattling off stuff that people told me on Reddit about how right this decision was, and how I'm doing the right thing, about how great it was that I was finally taking action, etc.

My sister stopped me though, and she looked at me angrily and said in a sarcastic tone, ""Wow, congratulations! Getting validation from strangers on the internet really makes you confident in yourself, huh?""

Why doesn't she see how right I am? This whole situation with my roommate is cut-and-dry, and I'm taking the necessary steps to fix it. 

I started reciting some of the answers I got (they were really well-written), but the more I spoke, the more angrier they got, until my sister's eyes bore into me like daggers, and my Mom was sort of just standing there laughing, in an exhausted kind of way. ""There's no going back now."" she said in a defeated tone of voice. ""What's done is done. You let random internet people tell you what to do instead of us, and you're going to feel the consequences of that decision very soon.""

My voice cracked a little as I desperately tried to convince them to side with me, until Dad said, ""That's enough. We're not talking about this anymore. You're making your Mom upset.""

Why can't my family just be proud of me? I'm clearly, *clearly* doing the right thing here, and yet my parents seem to be more concerned about preserving the peace with my deadbeat roommate than getting my money back. Their *son's* money! I'm the one they should feel sorry for, not him.

A lot of people in that Reddit thread told me that I care way too much about what my family thinks, and I agree whole-heartedly. I don't know how to stop caring about what they think, because right now, they're all I've got. I don't really have any good friends who will talk to me about life situations without tuning out, or ignoring me. I've never dealt with difficult life situations like this before, and I need all the support I can get. I try to do all the right things, all the time, and I can't please them or make them happy. Nothing is ever good enough. I apologize if I sound dramatic, but these emotions have a firm hold on me and I can't make them stop. 

I want people to know how much my parent's disapproval means to me. I know I shouldn't care, but I do. I might need some advice on how to stop caring what they think, because tonight, I felt like I *needed* them to tell me that I made the right decision, because I will be dealing with a pissed-off roommate for two months, and it would really help to have people in my corner to tell me that I'm not the bad person that my roommate is making me out to be.",4

My friends don't seem to care at all about me, and my family doesn't understand my depression at all. Hell, I don't even know if I can understand it myself either. It's hard to articulate, but the best I can put it is that half the time, I feel like I'm just lying to myself and using depression as an excuse to be like this. My parents have always told me that I shouldn't even be depressed, considering how easy I have life compared to others, and as much as I hate to say it, I agree. As much as I really just want to fix everything, I feel like I just want to kill myself. But I can't do it. I don't know why, but I can't. No matter how badly I want to do it, I can't bring myself to do it. Maybe I'll just have to learn to accept living like this.",5

I wish things were halfway as easy as neurotypical people think.

I think when people say they want to help and support people who struggle with mental illness and disorders, what they really want is for us to shut up and quietly suffer so they don't have to think about it or see it anymore. 

I talked to a counselor at my university the other day. She didn't pay attention to a single thing I said and only wanted to verify that I wouldn't kill myself. As long as I don't stain the university's reputation it doesn't matter if my quality of life is shit and I end up killing myself after leaving college.",5

    I am blessed with energy and curiosity,
    something no one should waste.

    I leave bed early, but barely awake,
    speeding for school, unconcerned for myself.

    I approach the opposite gender,
    nervous of their response.

    I am blessed with ease of learning,
    something that saves me even with all the time I waste.

    I force myself to work in the mornings,
    bills that must be paid.

    I've finally found the one,
    she makes it all better some way.

    I am blessed with love from family and friends,
    something I wish I wouldn't waste.

    I stay in darkness the entire day,
    if not my body, then at least my mind.

    Rejection is my only partner,
    at least it's always there.

    I am blessed with a pumping heart.
    something very stupid to waste.


    Years pass by, emotions and seasons change, sometimes life, is mystical in its ways


    I miss the joy of the mornings,
    now every sunrise brings more pain.

    I miss the adventures of romance,
    all that's left is a hallow heart and no will to change.

    I miss all the obvious blessings from previously in life,
    if only the earth could reverse its spinning, I think I'm ready for my own demise.

"Here is how pathetic I am. I am a 35 year old man (though I use that term loosely as I am pretty much a shitty example of one) and I have to post my problems to Reddit because I have no where else to turn to. I'll  give you the highlights. 

I have no friends and have always been the guy in the periphery of groups of friends. 

I was miserable in high school, probably had add or somethign. I was miserable in college and went to a shitty open enrollment commuter shool. 

I'm college I got my gf pregnant after dating her for two months.  She only wanted to work part time as a cashier despite the fact she has a nursing degree. I wanted to get my PhD as I was a liberal arts major and that was the only way to get a job. But I had to quit  that as I had to work two jobs (one full time) to support my new family. 

My only child doesn't even have my last name as my in laws have, over the last decade, tried to convince my wife I am going to walk out on the family. I have always sacrificed everything for them.

Despite a decade of working my ass off and sleepless nights I make less than 50k a year.


My wife developed depression and anxiety and was suicidal, she is now on meds. 

My wife also is infertile and we can never have more children, she also can't be intimate as she no longer produces mucous. I haven't had sex in three years and unless I have an affair (like that would even happen...... I'm too much of a loser for any woman to want that) I will never have sex again. 

My child has depression, anxiety, adhd,. He has been kicked out of one school already. Keeping him stable is a daily grind. I also missed most of the childhood moments working all those jobs and trying to do grad school. 

I drive a 13 year old car that just broke down for the third time this winter. 

My father has had several strokes and is 100% bed ridden, I have to help my elderly mother help him daily before I go into my low paying low prestige job. 

I no longer have my youth. 

I had less than $12k to my name. 

The only thing that made life bearable was drinking alone to just make stuff numb. I feel like I want to just give up and do that from here on out. Life is fucking shit, especially compared to where my peers are at in their lives. What is the fuking point. I am a loser in a very way imaginable

"And how utterly afraid I am. I suck at college. I am absolutely terrible at it. I just cannot seem to pull my head out of my ass when it counts. I am so unmotivated, not to mention tired. So damn tired. All the time. 

A lot of my worth is based on grades. When I was in school I would push myself too hard. After my anorexia calmed down a bit, so did my motivation to do schoolwork. Or anything. Without my eating disorder.

Ever since my eating disorder has been ""cured"" (and by that I mean calmed down to point where it's manageable enough that I don't have the constant need for exercise or racing thoughts over food and such) it's also had another impact: My motivation. I've noticed this ever since my anorexia really left me, my motivation is shot. I can't do college not because I don't have the mind or the resources but because I am simply not motivated enough to do anything. Before this, my anorexia and school work were tied together tightly and when I was in my funk but not so malnourished to function, my productivity would soar because it made me perfectionistic. Now, with that gone, I just can't find that motivation anymore.

But it doesn't just stop at school work. I am so tired lately. So incredibly tired. When I had my eating disorder I felt like I could lift mountains (until the wall hit of course) but now it's all I can do not to be asleep all of the time. It's why I don't go out much. Just getting out of my bed is harder than you can imagine. All I seem to ever want to do is sleep. I wake up and for and hour I'm all good, but after that it's a nap. And then 2 hours of wake and then I sleep the rest of the night. Luckily I don't have nightmares as I nap, only when I go for the long haul.

With the death of my anorexia (and to my shame I admit to trying to revive it several times) I have also lost my motivation and my spark it seems. Maybe it was because the only thing holding the haunting thoughts of trauma was my anorexia, and without that they are just free to take root in my mind and they very much do. The world is a much darker place. At least my anroexia had some sort of spark to it, as dark that flame was. Now I don't even have that.

Everything is just dark now. I have no motivation. No will. The only thing I seem to be able to bring myself to do is nap to avoid my pain. I'm honestly not sure what to do. I killed a enemy only to find it was merely the tail of a larger and more poisonous snake. 

Imagine seeing everything in back and white. That's pretty much how I see the world now. No more colors, no more fun shades. Just black and white. I'm more depressed now than I've ever been and no one is the wiser. I am so good at hiding it that no one sees anymore.",3

"Alright, here's the deal; I haven't slept in about twenty two hours and my mother is blaring the TV whilst my sisters are screaming, so I'll just say that this may end up being despicably sloppily written, and pathetically long. 

Okay, so now that that's out of the way, I'll get into what it is that brings me here.

In the summer of 2016 I met somebody who quite honestly, as cliched as it sounds, changed my life, and enlightened my soul with new experiences and knowledge and a love too deep, too overbearing for a lone human to take without an excruciating pain present in an almost constant cycle. 

Just saying, I'm a trans dude, in love with a dude, who also likes dudes (in fact, he was the one who helped me figure out my sexuality and supported me more than anyone else regarding my gender identity). Except he doesn't have romantic feelings towards me. Lovely, ain't it?

Anyway, ever since the very first phrases uttered to each other, there was a connection. Heck, I felt that connection when I first laid eyes upon him. No, I'm not talking about love at first sight, but I am certain there was an excitement, an understanding, you know? And I'm pretty sure he felt that connection too.

And that connection was ignited like a fire which fed off of the act of fooling, the act of making the sweet and the ripe believe it was eternal. Less poetically put, when he he started talking to me less and less, when his vibe held this sort of apathy, I was very much so disheartened and in complete disbelief. More accurately, I still am. 

And I blame myself. I blame myself because of my various mental illnesses, and my annoying, whiny and pathetic behaviour whilst he put so much, so so much into helping me out. He gave me advice, he stayed up all night to talk me out of suicide, he did everything in his power to convince me that I wasn't some useless loser. And he genuinely thought that. He genuinely cared. He genuinely thought I was an amazing human being. And frankly, if it weren't for him, there is a great chance that I'd be dead by now. Yes, okay, I've tried killing myself multiple times over the course of our friendship, however each and every time I failed, and holy hell was he glad I failed.

I mean, that's obviously not the only thing we spoke about. Of course not. We have everything in common. Jesus, we even have the same favourite colours. I am not religious or spiritual or whatever, but this? This guy, this friendship, it's simply too much of a miracle for it to be over now. Cause, you know, we've drifted apart (for the record, he knows I'm totally into him, but that isn't what changed things).

Honestly, I've never had friendsâlike, seriously, I've never had real friendsâbut this guy, and when somebody introduces you to something new like this? When somebody finally makes you feel like you matter? Yeah, that's pretty darn difficult to just let go of.

My problem is, we haven't really spoken about my ""issues"" in a while, and I'm seriously just one big mess. I tried to kill myself the other night, and though I don't think I plan on trying again any time soon, I am completely lost and I have no one. No one. Therapists and all that just don't work in my situation, and honestly, I just need him. As a friend. As someone who's there for me.

Except I don't want to annoy him. I don't want to be a burden. I don't want to make him feel bad, and any harsh feelings he may have towards me? Yeah, I deserve that, and I accept all of it. But I just don't know what to do. Would I be a complete and utter idiot if I texted him?",3

"Edited: changed some of the wording, and fixed a typo. I wrote this in a hurry.

Hello. The situation is as follows:

I suffer from extreme depression. I have been diagnosed with some OCD symptoms, but other than that, I exhibit no ""abnormal"" traits, and consequently most of my friends do not know that often, I am in a lot of pain.

I went to this school to get away from home, and this decision was supported by my doctors. First year, I ran through some obstacles, but overall, my grades were alright. I made new friends, the dean of engineering supported me (he ended up knowing of my depression), and although both semesters were hard, I would say that I did a good job.

Sophomore year, I also dealt with pain, but I had developed more ways to get rid of it. I had joined the dodgeball club, several intramural teams, and worked on a math conjecture which I later proved, which I was told needed graduate level work. 

I went through a variety of small situations in college, which I will not go into detail. It is universally agreed and seen that I have not made an attempt to hurt anyone or myself, nor have I made a threat to anyone or my own life. No fights, no animosity between me and teachers, nothing. I have spoken of being in a lot of pain, and one response to me disclosing this to professionals, which I now know is controversial, was to encourage me to go to a ward. I kept repeating that I thought it was a bad idea, but I finally gave in, and the result was terrible. I missed my classes, I was in a place where I was not allowed any homework or devices, and I felt separated from my friends. And I came to realize that the school may be playing a game to get me to leave. 

 Although I made many friends that see a happier, kind of smart guy who seems great to hang out with, I sought help with very close friends who were really extraordinary people who support me as I type this. I talked about my depression with these people, and they supported me, and we shared a common goal of me recovering to a much happier, less anxious person. 

One of these friends confided in someone from the staff that she was worried about me. She meant no harm by it, and was possibly optimistic that the person might help. The response, which she forwards back to me was to cut off all communication with me. This is from someone (the faculty member) who knows one thing about me- that I am depressed.

Time goes on, and I make it through freshman year. It was tough, but I know that staying close or at home would slowly break me. 

Fast forwarding through sophomore year, to the end of the first semester. I got sick, which prevents from exercising. I depend on exercise to relieve stress and I am in fantastic shape as a result. Strike 1. Then, because I was sick, I was in too much pain to sleep. So I didn't sleep for a whole night. Strike 2. Then I got drunk. Strike 3.

As I was drunk, I expressed suicidal thoughts. I was crying out for help, saying that I was in a lot of pain. Fast forward after that, since the next information will make the stuff in between not very helpful, and we have the student conduct board determining it was okay for me to go back. They were super kind, and the last call I had with them was very comforting with them. I met with my psychiatrist and told him everything, and he agreed I was ready to go back to school. Things weren't great, but they were easier. I was abused by security guards in the hospital they took me to(whole nuther story) and I was still trying to recover. Friends who were worried about me expressed their hope for my well-being. A teachers were happy when I told them I was allowed to go back, with all of them being very supportive.

It is important to keep in mind that, because of fear of something unfair happening, I keep my depression almost entirely to myself. 

Fast forward to now, I receive a call from the dean of student health and well-being that he wants me to leave. As simple as that. I tell him everything- that my parents think this is a bad idea, that professional opinion thinks its a fucking horrible idea, and that I have been studying hard to make up for the stuff I missed. He doesnt give a shit and insists on the meeting which has the chance to break me. 

Part of me sees this as a formality. He never explicitly stated that I will have to leave, and merely encouraged it at first. He says he will contact a third party evaluator to check on me, and this kind of comforts me cause if this person isn't from the school, I can easily convince him/her that a) I am not going to be in that situation again because I will never drink again b)that leaving the school with my closest friends and losing my courses there will leave me in a terrible state.

I ended up doing research and I learn that these meetings end up being one-sided. I did more research, and I see, given the situation, it violates the Americans with Disabilities Act on so many  levels.

Again, I do not know what they could or will do, and I politely expressed my concern with the dean who called me that I am worried that this meeting is a scam trying to flush me out. Of course I did not use those words. What worries me is that this person will eagerly ignore medical professionals or my reasoning that this was a bad idea to go on with the meeting. He has an extremely small, if any, amount of evidence that shows me as someone who should leave. But I am worried of how corrupt this meeting is.

Can someone please help me? I've been feeling sick after hearing about this. I have gotten a lot of support from friends, which, in written form, plays a role in the meeting. At least 10 people in 2 days have desired to write letters of support. I want to know if the absurdity of this leaves me another option other than crying. I know this is unfair, but the difference about this and, say, a bad referee call, is that this decision threatens my well-being and crushes the little chance I have to recover.",3
"My depression comes and goes, for the most part I'm content and happy, I just have a bad day here and there, but that hasn't been the case over the past month or so. I've gotten drunk almost everyday the past few weeks (although I am sober writing this and have no plans to drink tonight,) I've been overeating, and I've cut back on my workouts which has caused me to put on a little weight (although I guess that's pretty normal for people around the hollidays.) 

I've also been overagrresive and snap on the littlest dumb things. I've been destroying my house, putting holes in the wall and kicking doors and cabinets. I've also been waking up in my sleep pissed off from a dream and hitting the wall. I even woke up and headbutted the wall two times in a row which makes me feel like an absolute crazy person.

This kind of behavior is absolutely not fair to my best friend who is always there for me, my dog. It scares the shit out of him, and he doesn't know how to react. It really makes me feel like shit.

The forefront of my depression I think is due to the fact that I'm lonely. I have a good close group of friends, but most of them live hours away, so were just not able to hangout too often. It just sucks having no one to hangout with in my off time. Im also longing for companionship, a relationship, just someone to be with in a romantic manor. Ideally I'd like something serious with a girl. I do get to hangout with a girl every blue moon, and I'm usually elated afterwards and feel happy, but then it goes nowhere which makes me come down pretty hard.

Which as I'm writing this I'm realizing that may be why I'm in this slump. I met this cool girl, we hungout and had a good time, and I let my hopes get up because I thought I might actually have a chance of something happening with her. But in the end it was obvious that she just wasn't that into me. Which is ok, I'm over it, looking back and getting to know her a bit more I realize that we wouldn't have been a good match. I just wish I could find girls to go out with more than once every 6 months.

I'm just really lonely, I want someone to be with so bad. Someone that I can come home to and spend time with, and cuddle, and have sex of course, but all the other stuff is so much better for me. Of course, I know I have deeper seated issues than just loneliness. I also wish I would have accomplished more in life in general by now, being 27 yrs old, but I'm not gonna get into all that.

I'm not suicidal, although I do think about it everyday, and do wonder if it would be easier to just end it all. But there's no way I could go through with it right now. I love my friends, family, and my dog too much and know it would destroy them if I was gone. I do talk about this stuff with my friends and I'm pretty open with them as far as everything I've written here. So I do have a decent support system, but there's only so much they can do.

That being said, I'm not really asking for advice, I know what I need to do to get better and I recognize my problems. I just wanted to put it all into words to see if it made me feel better, and I think it did. Here's too a better year and getting my shit together. Thanks for reading.",4
"Hi. i need to post this. For the first time in my life i'm feeling lonely, i have always been extroverted and i have a lot of friends that i can call and hang out with but the last week i have been feeling lonely and depressed, manly because of a girl I like. 

I figured I needed to tell someone about it because iÂ¡m pretty shy and i don't want to tell any close friends of mine this. 

First of all, iÂ´m fat, and i feel bad about it I am trying to change it, I donÂ´t like it and i know how bad i look. I have never had a date before and i guess the main reason is because of the way i look, and because of that i haven't gathered the courage to ask anyone out. So, this girls just started working with me and i we started to talk to each other, many because we sit next to each other at the office, and because we both love reading and writing. I figured we had a lot in common so we started to talk about it. Last week I realized i like her a lot, i have never felt anything like it, but i'm really self conscious about the way i look and that if i tell her how i feel i will not know if i will be able to handle a rejection. I will still have to work with her and talk to her and i don't know if i will be able to do that. 

The holly day season didn't helped me either, this new year i spent it with my father at a restaurant and did absolutely nothing. I guess thats when i started to feel this way. 

I thought that telling anyone about this could help me understand why all of a sudden i'm feeling lonely and depressed and know what to do to change it. 

Thanks for reading/listening.

"For the past few months I've been going through a tough period of depression, but a month ago everything changed. Warning: long.

For the past year my parents have been fighting constantly. Their fights slowly grew in number and severity at the beginning of 2016, peaking in the summer and falling afterwards. January-May, June-August, August-December.

At the beginning I tried hard to not let it affect me, I genuinely believed I was fine, and that the fighting would pass. After all, my parents have always had a rocky history. Unfortunately the fights only grew, and I began fighting my mom. My mom invested a large amount of time into alternative healing, something I am strongly against. I hated it, I still hate it, I still get angry at my mom for falling into these traps. I want her to realize that her problem has nothing to do with toxins, imbalances, alkaline levels or mindfulness, the problem is her. Her as a whole.

I tried arguing this for months, to no avail. Overtime I guess it all got to me. The constant stress, the hatred towards my own home.

The mental problems first began at the beginning of the year. During this time I had constant racing thoughts, I was unable to maintain a clear head. I also felt extremely anxious at this time. Little things would cause me to become extremely anxious, such as being out and about with my own family. I was always afraid someone was watching my every move, even at home. I guess this counts as paranoia too. This affected me physically too, I was uneasy, my stomach hurt quite often. I was exhausted easily.

These feelings slowly disappeared, replaced with new ones in the summer. At the beginning of the summer, around June, I created a list of things I wanted to learn over the summer. I wanted to be productive over the summer. I never completed a single task on that list. Over summer I simply failed to complete anything. I would start projects, and never complete them. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with procrastination or depression. I wasn't necessarily sad, I simply failed to function. I would like to note that the fights both with my mom and between my mom and dad were at their worst during this time.

Fall and winter were the worst. I slowly became more and more depressed as the realization that my parents were officially going to divorce. My inability to function fully carried over. I would come home, fail to do my homework, or any work for the record. Even sitting at my desk and wasting time became exhausting. My parents fights decreased in number and in severity, but they affected me more than ever. I âblew upâ often during the summer, exploding in anger, but around this time I couldn't feel anything but sadness and hopelessness. I was too tired and too depressed to care. Not just about my parent's situation, but about school, about life. There were some rare times in which I had suicidal thoughts. I hardly cried, but I was completely broken on the inside.
(READ LIST)

-------------------

*Ups:*

**High energy**

* Shaky

* Hard to stay still

* Lack of need for sleep

* Pacing

Example: Once on a trip to Malaysia, my family was eating dinner, I wasn't. It was around 8:00PM that day and all I had was a red bean bun, one cucumber sushi roll and lots of water throughout the day. That night I felt so energetic that I had to get up out of my seat and walk around the restaurant in order to calm myself down. I was unable to calm myself down substantially, and was still highly energetic but I was a bit calmer.

**Paranoia**

* Loss of trust in others, even close family members and friends

* Believing others to be plotting against me in some form

* (Mixed with delusions) Thoughts of monsters trying to hunt me down

* Thoughts of people trying to kill me

* Government surveillance

* Loss of trust in those close to me

Example: On the way to the airport in December my mother, sister, grandparents and aunts split up in different taxis. My mother received a ride from her married friend. (This friend also has children.) My mom came a bit later than us, as she got lost. However I strangely acted out in paranoia, accusing her of having an affair with the man, accusing her of cheating on my dad. I lashed out, and raised my voice in the middle of the airport.

**Strong, Sudden in Self Confidence**

* Arrogance

* Godlike feelings and delusions

Example: Once when I was feeling up I texted my friend the following(each line represents a new text, this is unedited):

&gt;I feel another late night coming up

&gt;See nobody understands

&gt;But you fo

&gt;Do

&gt;I'm a fucking genius

&gt;You know I was watching this show

&gt;This guy

&gt;He says

&gt;""I always ask myself if I'm the most powerful man in the room, and I generally always am. That's what drove me for years.""

&gt;Great great quote

&gt;And I'm reading this book

&gt;On prioritizing what's important

&gt;There's so much for me to clear out

&gt;Tonight I'm hammering out that surveillance essay

&gt;My paranoia's also back

&gt;You know when I get home there's so much for me to do
	
&gt;I'm so fucking amazing

&gt;There's so mich

&gt;I'm only here for 100 years tops

&gt;I better be fucking remembered in 300

&gt;I'm going to meet Snowden

&gt;I'm going to get essay published

**Feeling out of touch with reality**

This one requires a longer explanation, when I feel this it's as if my life is a movie, and I'm watching it. I see everything I do and though I may regret it immediately afterwards, I can't stop myself. It's a strong feeling and loss of self control.

**Increased agitation**

Once again a feeling that requires an explanation. I get really easily angry during this state, and tend to lash out at people, even yelling at them. 

**Strange delusions**

This one also requires an explanation. One constant delusion is the idea that my life is specifically a greek tragedy. In a way this ties in with my self confidence boost, as I tend to feel like I am extremely important and a guaranteed powerful, historical character.

**Racing thoughts**

**Anxiety**

* Sick stomach feelings

* Shaky self

* Feeling of âbombardmentâ mentally

**Work motivation**

* Feel the need to do a ton of work

**Increased mistakes**

As was shown in the message transcript, I made several spelling errors, and in texts that's something I rarely do. For the past year or so I've refrained from making spelling errors and using standard text acronyms. Making mistakes in texts and emails is a rarity for me. I also tend to misread things.

Example: One Monday my dad reminded me to take our water bottles outside for a refill on Tuesday, the next day. He texted me this reminder. I immediately misread the text and assumed he wanted me to take the water bottles out that day, which made no sense to me as the bottles are collected on Wednesday mornings. I ended up engaging in an argument with him on this through text, freaking out and getting extremely angry with him. Only later did I realize the mistake I had made. Mistakes like this have been made several times.

**Memory problems**

* Tend to forget things more

**Feeling disconnected from self**

I really need to write this one out. I've been looking at old pictures and videos of myself, and while I know it's me, I don't feel like it's me. I feel as if I'm losing myself. I don't really know how to put it, but I just feel like I'm not myself. I know my name is OneAnonDepressed but I don't feel like I'm me. 

**Loss of hunger and appetite**

**Lack of sleep, but still energetic**

* This has led to several bad experiences, one detailed below.

**Strong, strange, dangerous urges**

* Urge to jump off of high places, but not suicidal

* Urge to throw my phone down in anger, happiness while laughing for no reason

* Urge to punch things randomly, but for fun, not out of anger

**Increased creativity**

====================

How this has impacted my life:

I've been more sociable, more likable in a sense. I've also been lashing out at people more, which is a negative. I've lost sleep and become unhealthier at the same time. I also tend to act on impulse, which has affected my social life both negatively and positively.

One time, on December 30th beginning in the early morning, a really scary and strange incident occurred. My dad called at around 1am asking when I was going to sleep and to be quiet. I could hardly speak, what came out was a garbled unintelligible mess. I spent about two hours listening to music and feeling ""high""(my sort of strange high). Then this intense paranoia kicks in and I'm afraid to close my eyes, I brought out my knife, prepared to stab something, some sort of monster I was convinced was in my room. Then I locked myself in my bathroom. I spent nine minutes in there but it felt like an hour.Eventually I run out of the bathroom to eat part of a cold burrito, which I was obsessed with doing despite still being paranoid about the imaginary monster. My mom sees me, I ignore her and run back upstairs to lock myself in the bathroom. My dad comes upstairs banging on the door as I was far too loud. I then start yelling and run downstairs trying to clean things for some reason. I eventually freak out downstairs, pacing and knocking down chairs. Then I start crying like crazy and my mind is racing and I'm screaming. Then I calmed down, it was 5am. I went to sleep, and didn't wake up until 8pm. The scariest part was that everything I did and felt was involuntary, and a part of me was rational and questioning myself, but that was overpowered. This is one clear example of these ups negatively affecting my life.

I've lost control and have developed a bad temper as well. Outbursts occur often, I can't control them. Once in an argument with my mom I've said some things I regret.

====================

Duration:

Generally lasts from a few hours to multiple days. Minimum of three hours and maximum of three weeks(ash?). First began in early December after a month of depression, continued for three weeks with a few hours of depression at random days in between.

-------------------

Downs:

**Apathy**

* Loss of interest in activities

* Lack of motivation to do anything, really

**Fatigue**

* Even after getting plenty of sleep

**Increased hunger and appetite**

* Eating for the sake of eating, intense hunger

**General feelings of hopelessness**

* Feeling like things don't matter, like nothing matters

**Suicidal thoughts**

* Self explanatory, wanting to die

**Hatred for self**

* Hating myself due to my inability to work well, constant cycle, falling deeper into well

**Loss of energy**

Most days I didn't want to get out of bed, and hardly anything motivated me to do so. The thought of failing school was all that kept me going, but it only kept me from failing, not succeeding.
Feelings and hope for nonexistence

Not exactly suicidal, but some days I didn't want to exist in the first place. 

====================

How this has impacted my life:

Throughout the month of November I was depressed. The problem with this is it led to a downfall at school. As soon as I got home it was insanely difficult to push myself to do any work, and I mostly just ended up doing nothing for a few hours until I ate dinner and fell asleep, repeating the cycle again the next day. Because of this, in English I wasn't keeping up with the weekly vocabulary work and reading a book we were supposed to read. When finals came around in early December I was unprepared, having only read around 10% of the book and studying 40% of the words. (Each week we received a new set of words and I stopped studying words as soon as the new ones came in. This ultimately led to me doing poorly on my English final. In my Japanese class I also slacked off, not completing work and so my teacher informed me that I would take the final when I returned after winter break. I also stopped talking with my parents, communication fell and I didn't really want to see anybody.

====================

Duration:

Generally lasts from a few hours to a few days. Minimum of one hour and maximum of one month. First began in November, long period ended at the end of November and occurred randomly in December.

-------------------

Mix:

Twice this has happened. The two feelings above have collided twice. Once, on December 8. Below is an exact, unedited copy of what I wrote down that night at around 10PM, I ended up forcing myself to go downstairs and ask my dad to walk with me around the neighborhood, as I felt horrible.

&gt;December 8

&gt;December 8

 &gt;I am not okay


&gt;Combining the two things I felt these past few months

&gt;The depression and the mild insanity

&gt;I'm filled with high energy but I want to calm down but I can't and my mind is racing and I feel like screaming but I won't

&gt;I swear I'm at war with myself right now

&gt;I'm isolating myself before I do something I will regret

&gt;I've already slipped multiple times, filter for speech gone.

&gt;I want to break stuff out of anger but I'm laughing and happy and crying inside

&gt;I'm not okay

&gt;I'm bouncing back and forth and I hate it

&gt;I want to do so much but I'm hollow

&gt;A THOUSAND EMOTIONS AT ONCE

&gt;HELP

&gt;NOTHING HELPS 		

&gt;I m isolating myself from my family for tonight I can't go downstairs I'm too unstable

The other time this happened I failed to record anything.

--------------------

To Conclude:

I'm not the kind to self diagnose myself, I don't overreact when it comes to medical problems, and most of the time I brush things off. But lately I've been searching around and researching what I'm feeling. I came across a few interviews of Stephen Fry, where he describes mental illnesses, specifically bipolar disorder, and it explains exactly what I'm feeling. I looked more into bipolar disorder and what people describe fits everything I'm feeling.

My mother told me that these feelings are normal during hard times, such as divorces. But I don't think so, this just doesn't feel right, even in my condition. I've already gone through what I would consider to be normal emotions during hard times.

My father told me that I'm fine, and it was just a clash of puberty and the hard times at home. I seriously doubt it. I've experienced teenage hormones, and even though some parts of that match what I feel when I'm up, including mood swings, it's all very mild by comparison. After confessing to having had suicidal thoughts my dad has been working on scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist.

If anyone wants clarification or has questions on anything please ask.

If anyone has had similar experiences and would like to share please do, I really am scared and am in desperate need of answers.",4
"I really want to connect with people. I really want to be understood, like normal people can understand each other. I really really really really want that.

Why does it have to be this way? No matter what I do I'll always be ""different"" and a ""weirdo"". FUCK THAT.

Fucking, what the fuck am I supposed to do, what am I supposed to do when the only way to connect with someone is to change, but change is impossible? I've felt like this ALL fucking month, but obviously I'm on a comedown right now, I think. Does butalbital have a comedown? I don't know.

Like, why does it have to be shit? I want to feel close to someone, I want someone to hold in my arms. I tried, I worked out, I cared about my appearance, I did everything right. Everything that I could-- and yet, I'm still stuck here just as alone as before. I'm stuck in my room, on a computer.

Is that too much to ask? Is that obsessive? Just to want someone to connect with, and hold? When, your whole life, you've been unable to connect with anyone. Even my own DAMN family, none of them ""get"" me. Why the fuck would a random stranger be able to get through to me? I'm fucking, hopelessly hopeful, that someone is going to come along and expose my soft side, that nobody knows I have.

I have a fucking heart, but I can't share it. There's no way to do that. I'm so depressed, now. It's not just the depression. It's everything. Everything I am, and everything I ever will be. Humans only have each other. But me, I'm not human. So I have nobody. I'm an alien, autistic, spaghetti-spilling retard doomed to never be understood or considered.

I want to just swallow all the rest of my barbs and finish a 6 pack. Fuck it, that's the only way I feel good, anymore. Drugs are the only way I feel good.

I'm too fuckin young for this shit. Why? Why me? I can't do this shit. People tell me ""you have time"". Time can't fix a broken robot.

I don't even know why I'm here. I have Asperger's. Nothing can fix me. Nothing can change me. I'm destined to be alone. I can't help myself, and nobody can help me. I want to be different, from the way I am, so baaadddd.. I want to be normal so badddd. It's so bad I just would rather die than live this disconnected.

The pain of being a weirdo who will never be able to connect with the world, it's immense.",4
But im completly numb now. I think i used to care too much about everything and everyone. But now i just dont care anymore. Which is liberating in someways but still sad I may never feel emotion again.,5
Not trying to sound like a post from Incels but I really wish I could find a girl that would like me back. I just feel so lonely sometimes and I just want someone to get close to and share the things I find amazing with. And on a more selfish note just having the validation and confidence booster in that I'm actually able to get a living breathing human to be interested in me for more than just friendship.,4
"EDIT: today was a better day. Thank you for allowing me to lean on you

I just can't do it anymore. I tried to get better. The meds, the therapy, the physical activity. It didn't work. Am I just supposed to go month after month hoping for the tiniest flicker of improvement? The ratio of work to improvement is terrible.

I don't want to kill myself, I just don't want to have to exist anymore.",5
"Cruelty can be administered through rejecting someone, but by ignoring them you take away their worth. Like they're below you.

For me, it's the lowest feeling. Nothing redeeming about me to even be noticed.",4
"I cannot name a single good thing about myself-I am not smart, not charismatic, not good looking, not a good person, not got social skills, got no talents or skills, I am bad at everything I've ever tried in my life. I have 1700 hours in CS:GO and I'm worse than people with half my hours, I played (association) football my whole life and I was always trash at that, I tried to do guitar for a few years when I was younger but I got kicked out because the teacher thought I wasn't practising-I was, I just was really bad at it. I have a few friends but they don't like me that much and I don't blame them because I'm a bad person to be friends with, I am boring, I have no distinct interests and I can't hold a conversation for more than 5 seconds. I just don't understand why I should like myself, if anything it'd be irrational not to hate myself because every single aspect of my life is going terribly and it's ultimately no-one's fault but my own.",5
"I'm feeling really unstable. Like, depressed with nausea. Living longer than my mother also sound unnecessary.  ",0
"2017 was a terrible year. I dealt with a horrible breakup. Depression and anxiety symptoms that had been held in check for a while became really bad. I lost a friend to suicide. I had my closest friends move away. I had physical health issues to deal with. I had some troubles at work.

The worst part of the year was that my dog got sick twice, and the second time was cancer. Like a lot of people, my dog has helped me through some really tough times. She's been the only reason I've gotten out of bed some days. I've had her for over 11 years. Six months ago she had some aggressive and expensive surgery to treat the cancer and it (seemingly) worked. She recovered well and is back to being her old high-energy self. The last couple of months I have felt so much better because she has too. 

Last week I found a lump on the site of her surgery. I'm waiting to see a specialist, but I'm devastated. If the cancer has returned I don't know if it will be treatable this time. I don't know if I can afford more surgery.

I'm not stupid - my dog is 11, and I know realistically she will only be around another couple of years at best. But I can't imagine life without her, especially now. I don't know how to handle her being sick again and potentially suffering. I can't handle her dying. I can't handle her being gone.

If you're not a pet person, you probably don't understand this, but for 11 years I've always had at least one thing that loved me and relied on me. She's kept me going and I don't know what to do without her. Thanks for listening.

**TL;DR: My dog may have cancer again, and I'm afraid of losing her.**

"So I've been having depression for the past 1.5 Years now, went to a psychiatrist for the whole time. Parents got divorced, I'm getting my insurance cut off so I can no longer afford the psychiatrist anymore. I work part time and go to university full time. My moms been trying to switch car insurances but some places refused because of my driving record (3 accidents, 1 ticket) and the one were at now is out of our pay range. I'm just really tired. Literally a waste of money. My boyfriend of 6 months recently ghosted me so the wound is still fresh. I don't know what to do, I just feel like a waste and a burden. Since my boyfriend disappeared there's no one I can talk to honestly. I just want someone to hug me and tell me things will be okay.",2
"I just need to vent and I'm all alone. 

2017 started off as a great year. I had a good job, had a great girlfriend, no debt, bought a new car, had a nice apartment. You name it and I had it. Then it all fell apart. 

I feel so alone, I went from everything one day to absolutely nothing the next. I asked my girlfriend of two years to talk because she has struggled with depression and I felt that she was slipping into a spell so I was trying to help her. Turns out she was miserable and decided that day that we were going to break up and that she was moving out of our apartment that week. She left and I haven't seen or heard from her since.

Then I started drinking and realized how alone I really am. I don't have family, I don't have friends. The one friend I did have I screwed up because of my drinking. I just feel alone.

I got demoted at work. Had to start paying for an apartment meant for two by myself. I just had no one to talk to and I still don't. 

I've tried traveling and that doesn't make me any happier. I've tried going out by myself but I just can't talk to people or make friends. I feel damaged as a person. I feel like I've lost everything that makes me a real person. I can't even meet people. I talk to strangers or people who seem interested in talking to me and we get along well, but as soon as the conversation stops that's it. I've gotten numbers from girls to go out and never hear back from them. I've got numbers from guys to try and meet and hang out to try and be social and I never hear from them either.

I hate my job, I hate the city I live in, I hate how I look, I hate my inability to talk to people, but mainly I hate myself. I ruin everything I touch, I am never enough for anyone, and I am never wanted by anyone. 

I try to keep a pretty positive attitude but each day it gets harder and harder. I can't stand to look at myself, I don't even know who I am. Each day I feel more and more like I am not worth anything, that my life just isn't worth it. I wish each day to just not wake up. Each hour sitting at home in the darkness pushes me closer and closer to actually killing myself. I try to hold on, I try to push myself to see the bright side but I can't. 

My best friend doesn't talk to me, my other closest friend hates me. Every person I know that was friends with my ex and I constantly bring her up and how shes so much happier now. And to top it all off I just found out that she is now engaged. We dated for a bit over two years and it just ended. Just so abruptly. And now 9 months later shes engaged.

It kills me to think about. It physically hurts. I feel like throwing up, I'm an anxious mess; but I have no one to talk to about this. Now I'm sitting alone at work for the new years. No one is wishing me a happy new year, no one is caring that I make it home tonight, no one would even know If I killed myself.

Just when do things get better? I hate feeling worthless, I hate feeling like a burden to everyone around me, I hate being alone. I hate the feeling of not wanting to live anymore but honestly it's the only comforting thought.",2
Just had a close friend completely block me and as the title suggests he was a furry. He recently came out as a furry and I was fine with it but recently he started hanging out with his furry friends and just up and blocked me today. One of his new friends might be a pedophile anyways and they were talking about meeting up to go to a con but you know what screw him. So yes I am now depressed as he was my only friend.,4
"My parents are divorced since I was 3. No big deal, many people started off worse. I've been living with my mom and rarely meet my dad because I'm too busy. Recently, I met up with my dad and my foster mother, and they thought I might have some psychological problems. Not severe, but still. They wanted to get me checked out. But my mom don't agree. She thought the other parents were overreacting. Personally I do feel off balance at times, and I WOULD get myself tested just to see if I'm okay or not. But even when I expressed that wish, mom still wouldn't take it more seriously and ignore it.
I don't want to come to my dad crying out for help because that would just make my mom and dad argue once more, and many many more problems regarding my family might ensue. But I still feel really upset with the fact that mom wouldn't get me any help even though it costs her nothing.
Thanks for reading, I know there are people being in way worse situations than I am, but I just need to take this off my mind.",4
"Apologies for the lengthy post..
**A brief about me:**
*Personal*:I am 25 yo male,gay,was molested by a few guys at different times.I  have low self-esteem about my physique(dark toned,thin with glasses).I have dental fluorosis(dark yellowish teeth), so I never smiled or laughed with my mouth open.Became sort of addicted to porn,hookups between August 2016-May,2017-had poor performance in career. Did shitty things like cruising at public toilets/groping at busses,etc.. since 2013 at various times.
Even through all these confusions, I am quite social now with all the fellow interns. 
I never shared any of my problems because, no body gives a shit and they might take it as a way to tease me. I hate small talk/sharing of facts/any talk about movies.I usually am silent if I went for a group dinner. I find it pretty hard to talk in group,also, I do not remember such facts about which country has X resources/so on.

*Career*:Finished Masters in Engineering with above avg GPA. Got a job through campus.Now, doing a research Internship and planning for PhD.
**About current work:**In my present internship, I was given a development project which I was not interested at all.Every others were given some interesting research work.I could have finished mine earlier and switched to something else, but I am dragging the work for so longgggggg. In every weekly meeting, I just lie to the Prof. that I did something something.All the other interns have detailed slides of their past week's work, but I write it in 1 or 2 lines. So, I am the worst performing guy in the Lab(I have the potential, but the project is dull and in this period, I came to a good understanding of my behavior,sexuality,addictions and so on.Now I am on track-No hookups,no Fap,no addiction to porn).I was also addicted to chess--played for 4-5 hours straight daily while others were seriously working on their projects.

**What happened:** This New Year, I was not invited for a jungle camping which every other lab mates went.Around 10+ people went.I used to talk with everyone whenever I meet.Even I asked a guy, the day before what was his plan for New year, he said he is just gonna stay in room. Few days back, they didn't invite me for a dinner too.

I do not know what has caused them to ignore me. Most of them are from well-to-do family, but mine is still kind of unstable with debts.So, I never eat costlier outside food and wear same clothes again and again and never go out for watching movies/party. I am in the city for 4 years and have been to a few places every now and then alone and am not interested to go out nowadays.I went for a cycle ride 2 weeks back with one other girl intern without informing anyone.

**How I felt that day?**
I was pretty irritated. They gathered outside my room discussing with my roommate,before leaving for the party.My roommate too didn't invite me either.The next few hours, I was thinking what I did wrong? why they left me alone? Why that guy lied? and this affected my normal day-day activities.I took longer time than usual in everything. I relapsed to chatting with strangers for hookups and jerked off after 25+ days of NoFap. I spent around 9 hours watching porn/porn images/chat with strangers.

**How do I feel now?**
* I know God has different plans for me and this party/get together is not for me.
* I am gonna stop talking with everyone except the close ones and prove my worth by achieving a level higher than all those people.
* I started my 2018 pretty good, with some self reflection and new thoughts for my PhD admission. I am kind of between introvert and extrovert, so my room was the ideal place for me anytime.
*I set out a few goals for 2018 and I am on track.I have read 30 pages yesterday and continuing.Target: 100 books in 2018.
*I didn't drink or eat crazy and have a good start.

Though, everything is fine with me now,I would like to know any similar experiences and how people dealt with this. I am okay with not going for the party(bcoz, I would not have enjoyed as much as staying alone),but I could not handle the lie and the fact that everybody took great efforts to conceal this from me.

Tl;Dr: Not invited for the New Year celebration by lab mates.How to move forward??
Sorry if this is not the right subreddit to ask about this.",1
"In twenty-five years of existence, 2016 has had to have been the worst year of my life. I have lost nearly every friend that was truly dear to me when the year started. One stole a pretty substantial amount of money from me, another was that ones twin, another ridiculed and belittled me behind my back to try to get into bed with an ex of mine, etc. Although, a woe from the year before, I am also dealing with my best friend marring and moving across the country. Any thing even remotely romance related is a self destructive mess. I was introduced to a young women and her young son back in July. We talked for a while and I was instantly head over heels for this girl. The first person I had really been interested in after calling off an engagement in early 2015. I proceed to spend the next six months busting my ass for someone that only sees me when it is convenient to her, under the self illusion that she had just been burnt to many time and had suffered a rough enough home life that she would just take time to warm her up to the idea of something steady. She has done me wrong some many times in that time that I've lost count. Last week she calls me wanting help because they have no where to go. What can i do, put a two year old on the street? The entire time up until last night has been decent, then she drops on me that some guy is blowing her up because they went on one date and she won't go on another. Mind you, in the time I've know her, she's bailed on every single date we have had planned that involved anything more than hanging out at my place. We had plans for me to take them out to dinner tonight. Where am I? At home, with a bourbon on the rocks, being a burden on the rest of the Reddit society on New Years. Mean while, she is out with her ""friends"" and wont respond to anything. So, cheers to 2017. I hope for a fantastic year to anyone who has sat through my tears and maybe one not so destructive for myself. ",4

"I met my first girlfriend in high school, and I fell hard. She was smart, confident, gutsy, and the first person I felt comfortable talking about my kinks. She did not do anything half-assed, everything she touched she put her energy into. We were both in tech and had startup dreams. She had to run away from an abusive parent, and ended up staying at my place for a time. I thought we had a genuine connection. But she kept comparing me to her other ex, saying that he left her with high standards. Then she started college and first week she dumps me for a startup hotshot, saying she was tired of waiting for me to improve myself. 

So college came around for me, and I hyped myself up. I was going to work hard, play hard, and have a bunch of sex and meet my next girlfriend and future wife. I was going to meet my cofounder and start a cool company. But none of that really happened. Mechanical engineering was tough and ate up most of my socializing/free time. I was in a new city where I knew zero people. I fell into a rut and dropped out.

Additionally, I started thinking my current friends and family were boring, and I started distancing myself from them. In retrospect I was too harsh judging them; nevertheless I still feel disconnected from them.

I know It's bad to not compare myself to her, but my imagination still runs wild. I cut out Facebook, Twitter, and blocked her out of my life, but I still cannot stop comparing myself to her. She is smart and got an internship for a big tech company right into college, and was getting featured in the local paper. She got invited to tech events and parties.

It's been three years and my self esteem never recovered. I feel I've let myself down, not finding a girlfriend and screwing up with engineering. Online dating/hookups didn't work. The sexual frustration sucks. I don't want to waste away my twenties being single. I thought about hurting myself, but after sleeping on it I realize that will do no good. 

I'm in a mental stalemate: I've cut her out of my life, but I still have low self esteem. I see-saw in between being whiny about myself, and angrily wanting to punch every couple in the street. I've tried three different therapists to little improvement, and my mopey-ness is straining my relationship with my dad. 

Things are getting better at a glacial pace, but that feeling of failure still clouts my mind. I've binged many articles/videos (DFW, Alan Watts, School of Life, etc.), started going to sleep earlier, and started journaling. However, the feeling of failure still affects my day-to-day where I can barely keep my job. I still get discouraged on even the most minor of challenges.

"I'm not that smart. My mom is a very smart woman working on her doctorates in psychology. As you can see I have a lot of pressure on me.

But i failed, i went to tutoring every tuesday and thursday and most of the time I had to walk home. I honestly tried and it wasn't enough. I'm currently on my 2 week break and i'm almost back to school. Soon my mom will find out and say how i'm a failure like by brother and my dad. I genuinely tried to do good for my mom, step dad and my friends but I failed in the end. She's gonna find out soon.

Christmas and New Year's are over, and I still feel this melancholy weight blanketing me that won't go away. But I'm expected to go to work parties and parties with friends and partake in festivities that I do not at all take pleasure in. I'm expected to smile and participate in these rituals, even by the people who know me well enough to know that I want to be miles away from anything to do with a holiday.

"I don't even know anymore. Being alone fucking sucks. Being everybody's last choice fucking sucks. BEING TOO SCARED TO MEET NEW PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TALK TO THEM WITHOUT HAVING A FUCKING PANIC ATTACK SUCKS. 11th of November. That's when my last real friend left me. Knew them for years, fought all the time. One day we kinda just drifted away and now we don't speak at all. It affected me a lot more, because they were all I fuckin had. Don't blame them. I'm a pessimistic, worthless, talentless idiot without anything good to say about myself. I can truly and wholeheartedly say without a doubt; 'I. HATE. MYSELF.' 

I don't know. I can laugh with people, I can joke around and forget everything. But sometimes it all gets too much and even if nothing happened that day, everything starts closing in on me and my heart starts beating faster and I just want to die. I dig my nails so hard into my legs and forearms that it draws blood and I shrink away wanting nothing more than to cry. But I don't. My friends either laugh at me or tell me it's bullshit and I'm just seeking attention. So I sit silently beating myself up with a blank expression, tearing up my own skin and planning a new suicide attempt.  

That's what it's like now. Nothing happened nothing FUCKING happened why is this happening to me I did nothing wrong I was OKAY, I was FINE but now I'm not and I want to die and I just..god. I can't even put it into words. I just want to die so much. So so much. My life is meaningless. I have no future to look forward to. I have no talents, no friends, nothing to live for. I haven't really done much these past few days. I haven't eaten since Saturday. I don't do anything productive. I've just laid in my bed with the blinds closed, staring at the fucking wall with drying blood on my hands and bandaged arms. No one notices. And no one WILL notice. Not until the neighbors notice the rotting smell in a few weeks. 

I suppose this is the end, right? I'll probably be dead and gone in a few days anyway. There's rope in my closet, pills in the bathroom, blades on my floor and a gun under my pillow. But right now I can't really get up. I can't get out of bed today.",4

"27 years old, short (168 cm), no job, no girlfriend, no friends, no future.

 Earlier in life I was an idiot and didn't get any useful degree (even though I had an opportunity at the time) and got a stupid manager education instead just because it was easier. After that never worked as a manager cause I don't like people so of course I hated the job. Was working some random jobs which I hated aswell. 

 One day I decided to quit, move to the big city and get a decent degree in something. Figured I like computers so I'm gonna go ahead and be a computer guy. Got into the university for evening classes but couldn't even finish the first semester cause I was unable to find a decent day job to pay for this education so I got really sad and couldn't focus on the classes, plus I realized that this profession is way too hard for me.

  Years ago got alienated from a few friends I had cause coulnd't stand being a looser in front of them. Never had a proper sexual relationships cause on top of everything I'm a premature ejaculator so I guess it psychologically distanced me from getting intimate with girls. Got a decent body and in a good shape but to maintain it I have to work out regularly and eat crazy amounts of food in order to not become a scrawny ass motherfucker I was in high school. 

So here I am. Almost 30 and have nothing and no one except my mom. And it numbs me. Paralyzes me every second of my life. I can't even enjoy a movie now. Can't watch how all these tall men on the screen live their beatiful and interesting lives without hating myself for my life choices. So I just stuck in my apartment playing videogames all day to silence the pain while mother paying my bills. Nothing interests me anymore. Nothing brings joy. All I wanna do is to die.

"It's like cancer. ""You've got 4 months to live."" But sometimes for some reason you outlive their prognosis. ""You've lived for 3 months more!"" It's like suicide. You choose a week. Or you think this week will be the last one. And surprisingly, when THE day comes...it goes just as it comes and you are still breathing. 

When do you know it's time? Well, I've been spinning in circles for a while now. Round and round and round. Joy, sadness. Over and over and over again. 

In my dream world, I would be happy, not angry, not sad. I would finally be able to evolve into the woman I envision myself as instead of constantly grabbing her by the cuff of her sleeve. And I would finally publish my book, and be confident in the story. Maybe even sing some songs and feel confident about it. Have a guy who will love me and cherish me. Not control me, not contact me only when he wants something, not judging me and calling me chubby. 

Be able to be worthy enough for the attention of this one guy in my school. I always see him. Always. But he just doesn't see me. I guess that's how it's supposed to be. With a guy who looks like an Abercrombie Fitch model and a girl who looks like she sells tomatoes for a living. A guy who has nearly a thousand followers on Instagram and a girl who just has 400. Funny isn't it? 

Or friends who don't constantly make death jokes with me. ""I should get your head tattooed with a noose around your neck"". Thanks, best friend. ",4
"So I posted this on facebook to share with the handful of friends I know that are also suffering from mental illness. Unfortunately it was met with a wave of ""GET HELP"" messages that were not warranted or asked for. 

So I'm going to share it here with you folks and hope that it helps at least one person.

_____________________________________________________

I want to share something with all of my friends that are suffering from depression, anxiety or other mental illness. It's something I've been trying to do since I moved and I'm making it my official new years resolution. I won't promise it will work for you. We're all different, but it has helped me.

Every day pick one productive thing to get done. Just ONE. Even if it's something insignificant. Especially on the days you just want to stay in bed and wish for death and you can't find any motivation to do anything else.

Even something as simple as washing your hair. Wash that one pan you've been letting 'soak' in the sink for the last three days. Do one load of laundry and actually fold it and put it away. Sweep your kitchen floor. Vacuum your living room. Wipe your kitchen counters. Just one thing, even if it only takes 5 minutes.

Sometimes you may even find that overcoming that initial inertia gives you enough energy and motivation to do more. Maybe you clean the whole kitchen instead of just doing that one dish. But don't worry if it doesn't. As long as you do the one thing.

Just doing one productive thing each day can make you hate yourself a little less and feel a little less worthless.  And maybe when you come home from work and walk into a slightly cleaner kitchen you'll have a little feeling of satisfaction that is often elusive to those of us suffering with mental illness.

It's not a cure or anything. It might not even work for you. I don't know. I just wanted to share something that has helped me a little. Maybe it can help you too.

_____________________________________________________

That's what I posted on facebook but I want to lay down some rules for this exercise. 

1. **Don't** make a 'to do' list. Writing down everything you need / want to get done and having a big list to look at can be incredibly overwhelming and may cause you to recede further into your illness and retreat. We don't want that. Pick the one thing you want to get done either the night before or that morning and just do it. 

2. Your basic responsibilities such as going to work and feeding your children / pets does not count. Most of us have already learned to go through the motions of doing these things without reaching out of our comfort zone. Pick something you would normally procrastinate on or not do at all. 

3. Do it every day no matter what. No matter how shitty you feel or how badly you want to stay in bed. Staying in bed and doing nothing only feeds into our sense of worthlessness and self hatred. Get your ass up and at least do the one thing, even if you go right back to bed afterwards. If you are having an extraordinarily bad day pick the easiest thing you can possibly think of to get done and do it. Even if it only takes 30 seconds.

4. Allow yourself forgiveness if you don't complete your task to the extent that you originally wanted to. Beating yourself up is counter productive to the point of the exercise. Quoted from one of our members that suggested this rule.
&gt;I've been doing this and it does help. I am also more forgiving of myself. If I did have something I wanted to do, but didn't get it done I tell myself: it's okay, at least you got x,y,z done, and next time you should try to do x,y,z better. Really really really helps. 

_____________________________________________________

Please feel free to share / discuss any other rules for this exercise that should be added.

And of course PLEASE share with us how / if it's working for you. Tell us the things you accomplished today and in the future. 

For me today I cleaned my critter cages and took one of them that is no longer in use out to my garage and vacuumed the room I keep them in.

___________________________________________________

TL:DR (though I urge you to read at least the basic rules of the exercise) Do one productive thing a day no matter what. It might help you feel a little less worthless and demotivated. ",5
"Hello there.

First of all, this isn't an 'emergency' or something, I'm not suicidal and I know I'll get over this depression, but maybe somebody can help make it quicker.

I'm a 27 year old male and about 5 months ago I lost the parent who raised me. I was fat most of my life, except for a few years when I was a teen. I'm 5'10 (178cm) and 285 pounds (130kg) atm, I'm really unhappy with my body and my voice. I'm not handsome by any standard and I'm poor too (and I'm getting bald).

Recently I fell in love for a girl but she lives in US and she's smart and beautiful, I'm from western Europe and I don't have the money to go to US. If I had the means to go I'd surely at least try even though I know I'd probably be rejected (like, 99.9% of chance). I have a lot of responsibilities here too. I'm losing weight but it's probably going to take a few months/years to reach my ideal and even when that happens I guess I'll have loose skin. The fact is: I wouldn't want to date someone like me, how can I expect others to? Please don't come up with that acceptance thing, although I really appreciate the good intentions I just can't change what my brain finds attractive or not.

I've never been with a girl I loved ( or not :P ), I've only loved 3 girls so far, one when I was 17 and I was slim and such, but I didn't have the balls to express my feelings. Then again when I was I guess 20 or something, I wasn't very obese so I was somewhat OK with my weight, but the girls was from Australia and we didn't even have the time to know each other better.

People keep saying that's a 'crush' or something, but that's a start isn't it? I mean, I don't feel like approaching girls I don't feel something strong for and I totally don't believe 'real long-lasting love' will emerge from a forced relationship. A girl once wanted to approach me (but I was in love with that 2nd girl) so I suppose I'm not unbearably ugly but I certainly can't compete with the other guys in terms of looks.

I've been working my 'bottom' off for some time now, and I hope to make some money to be financially comfortable, but I don't want a girl to like me because of that, while I surely plan to use some of the money to improve myself.

I like smart girls with strong political opinions and definitely I don't like 'good' girls that are OK with everything and always trying to avoid conflicts. This girls I'm in love with really seems the perfect match, I honestly never been so sure about that, but I simply can't have her.

So, this is the situation I'm facing at the moment, my heart aches so much but I don't express it to others. I don't have anyone to talk about that only my dog and although that helps a bit it doesn't count much.

I'm trying to focus on my work to forget her but I can't. Everything I see feels familiar in a way that reminds her, this is something I never felt before, even looking at this text somehow I remind her face. Maybe there's a hormonal imbalance or something. I'm certainly not discarding the possibility of a physiological effect.

So, sorry for the big text and thank you for reading it. I'd really appreciate any advice on that. Thank you very much.

**EDIT** Added metric units",1
"I only take Lexapro. I was watching some videos on these guy that call themselves ""Preppers"" and they prep for the end of the world. They say that people on any types of drugs will become unstable and focused on getting their fix or whatever. Is that us? ",3
"Started a self defense class in November. Have gone 2 times. Took 3 weeks off. They probably think it's for the holidays but I was sick. I hate the class. I feel inept and like a complete dumb ass but one kid gave me some respect and shook my hand so that felt good. It's mostly guys in there so I feel like there's less of the fakeness you would get from women. 

I think I would like the class if I were good at it and felt like I fit in better, but I'm completely self-conscious and I suck at some of the moves they teach us. I got owned by a couple teenagers the first week I went, made me feel like crap. 

I've never been much into sports. I deeply wish that someone would've taken time out of their day to help me understand sports or develop my athleticism but no one did. 

This kinda feels the way church used to. The longer I would skip out on church, the less likely I would be to go back and the more guilty I would feel. 

I do have other stuff to do. I think I'm about to lose my job so I could apply for jobs, I could play video games, I could learn how football works, workout...

This class is just so damn far out of my comfort zone. Please comment. If I don't go, is that self sabotage??

If you're going to be mean, please don't comment. ",5
"Because maybe I'm called ""weak"", ""a pussy"", or an ""attention seeker"" when I do. One of the WORST things about having depression is dealing with ignorant assholes and the stigma. The stigma itself is why we refuse to tell anyone. I just want to know when people will wake up and realize that this thing isn't some kind of joke and that it is KILLING people.",4
"I've struggled with depression before for years and now I'm better. My partner has also been having really bad depression and I've been trying my best to help her get better. Today she finally ended it all. I tried so hard to help her, yet I failed. ",5
"Too many things have happened in the past few days, weeks, months. My parents lost their jobs, I lost my relationship with my gf and she just moved out yesterday. I had to say goodbye to my father because he's moved away and I don't know if I'll ever see him again because his girlfriend doesn't like me. I'm losing my apartment, I lost my job, my best friend moved away chasing some girl, I'm still a fat piece of shit, but not to get too far off topic. Today I sat in my room on the floor where my bed used to be because my ex took it since she paid for it. I loaded my gun and held it to my head for about a half hour and just thought about everything and how completely dead and empty I am inside. About how I can remember as a child wondering if anything will ever get better. Sure some things have been great but it's always accompanied by things that are just horrible. I'm miserable. I wish I had someone to talk to. I can't talk to my mom because she would get freaked out about it. My closest friends I can't really even talk to about shit like this either. So here I am posting on the internet about how much I hate myself. I know I'll never really commit suicide, i know I'd rather just float through life and hope something becomes of it. But every day is so hard not to just give up. I've lost damn near all of my friends. I'm getting older and losing time to fix my problems. I just think that if I can't find something to make me happy soon I don't know what will happen. I think I'm so stuck in my past I can't see my future. I normally can be self composed but fuck it's just getting to me. I'm miserable and I hate myself and i just needed to vent to something. ",4
"Hi there, I'm here really just looking for some help, not for me specifically, but for a friend, or maybe help for me on how to help her. Warning, this is going to be kinda long.

Freshman year of college, I met an amazing girl in my major. Smart, outgoing, an athlete, and she subscribed to my quirky/dark humor. We actually hooked up pretty much right after meeting, I thought I was in love. We fooled around for most of freshman year, I thought things were going great.

Turns out things were not going great. I always felt something was kind of off with her, she would always get this vacant look in her eyes whenever we were fooling around, she was like a different person. As it turns out, she was assaulted in high school, and it really messed with her. She basically lost the ability to say ""no"" but at the same time hated herself for it, she she shut herself away while things happened and then dealt with the personal fallout later. She finally just kinda swore off sex at the beginning of sophomore year. That was her band-aid. I fear she's still fighting a losing battle though.

She isn't sleeping well, she's hiding away from people more and more every day. She gets mad at me for trying to get too close. She's scared to let herself have any fun, to go out and party because she's afraid that she'll fall back into old habits, and she can't afford to do that anymore. She has pretty vivid nightmares regularly. I've witnessed one, they're fucking awful. I didn't want to touch her and influence her dream, but I had to keep her from thrashing into desks. Lose-Lose situation.

She says she's smart enough that she knows suicide isn't the answer for her, but I know she has lapses in judgement, I know she has made attempts in the past, or at least plans for attempts. I'm just afraid everything is just going to get worse, that shes going to keep having these lapses and shes going to get closer and closer.

I just want some help, some advice. I want to know how to make sure I don't lose one of the few people in this world I truly care about. I wonder if any of you have been in similar situations, either mine or her's, and what kinds of steps you have taken.   ",1
"It's like nothing really makes me feel good. Guess it's worse today cause I forgot to take my meds today but still. Why cant life just be a little easier, just a little.

"I grabbed a pile of old pictures that were close to my heart and pills. I locked the door and layed out the pictures which included pictures of my mom when she was young me as a kid my dad and my siblings. Then i layed the pills the opposite direction of the pills and it was facing me. As i looked at pictures tears came rolling down my face. I look at the time its 8:30 pm.then i look at the pills. I grab them open them and then i turn the cup upside down which resulted the pills touching my mouth. Then it came to me. The thought of everything and i quickly close them back wipe my tears and decide to stay alive. I dont know if this was a suicide attempt but i thought inshould share this here. This really marked me. Here i am typing this after deciding that i want to be alive. After tomorrow, many scary struggles will await for me. But i stayed alive and thats all that matters.

"I'm trying to get out of my depression and bought a couple of self help/ motivation books to help me.

This may seem irrelevant to depression but I'm looking for people who are gamers and have any of the platforms I ask because I've been trying to find decent friends and I would like to start trying again I haven't had any luck t doesn't have to be gaming related just preferred I I just would like to find decent friends ,4
"Its all pretty much my fault. I've isolated myself from my friends and the only one I have left is my best friend that I've known since we were 4. We are now 24 years old. Anyways, me and my husband join my friend (who happens to be pregnant) and her boyfriend (who is a recovering alcoholic) for dinner earlier tonight after they leave an AA meeting. All's well and we depart from them around 11 hoping to find something to do as a couple. We end up coming to the conclusion that we have nowhere to be and go home to do what we always do. My husband plays on his xbox and I watch youtube videos. Literally. I've been depressed for years but its little situations like this that get to me. How did I let myself get to this point? I used to have so many friends and so many things to do. But I always just push everyone away and I don't realize it until its too late and too far gone for an apology. I did however start a new job today after not working for the past year and a half after giving birth to my son and staying home to take care of him. I'm hoping things will change. New job, new semester. I just can't help but to cry though. My husband gave me a peck at midnight and he continued on and so did I. He fell asleep around 2am and I ended up leaving and just getting back home 2 hours later. I went for a drive and walked around Wal-Mart. Yeah. Its not our relationship that saddens me or anything about my home life or anything in particular. I feel like everyday gets slightly worse. I want so badly to be a happy person for my husband and my son. I see my husband mirroring my actions and my attitude of disgust toward life and I hate it. I want to get better so badly for my family. I have an appt this month and I hope to go regularly if I can afford the copay and a sitter- which is why I got a job.

"I can't write about my depression because it is so much a part of me that it can't be explained. Or at least that's what it feels like.

For starters, I haven't been diagnosed and I'm only 15. 

I have been living in this washed up state of grey for a few years now. I have sucessfully managed to push away all of my ""friends"", I have created this paralyzing reputation for myself as sad and apathetic and stupid and not hardworking and selfish. I haven't felt a positive emotion in so long and when I do it will go away within an hour. 

I cried for 45 minutes during class today and nobody even noticed and if they did they didn't find it strange or worrisome. It hurts inside to smile and I could never pretend to be happy because it would kill me. 

I am so stuck in all of this mental illness (that possibly could not even be real because I haven't been diagnosed or seen a doctor) 

I don't know why I'm writing or posting this, sorry.

"Here's my story,
I have recently turned fourteen and I've recently noticed some really weird changes in my feelings and my behaviors.  I'm not sure where to start so I will try to explain my emotional state recently.
Some pretty weird things have been happeing to me latley and I'm not so sure what to think of them.  I've started having these ""episodes"" where I get super upset for no reason (the no reason is actually another problem I've been having which I will get into in just a second) and I'll just start ignoring people who text me which makes them worried and super upset.  And the ""no reason"" has been a super big problem for me and that problem is when other people treat me indifferently?  Its like when someone talks to me and they'll talk to me in a way that makes them seem like they don't care about me (now I want to adress that this is indeed an incredibly selfish point of view but I don't know how to work on it and make it stop or go away) and it makes me feel like total shit and just start hating everthing.  
I've also noticed that I have barley eaten, which is a pretty normal thing for me because I'm super fucking picky and only eat like snack foods french fries and mcdonalds, but now I'm actually getting scared for myself like today I was basically starving so I went to make waffles at 2 fucking AM.  I'm also aware that not eating is a sign of depression which is kinda scary to me as well because I fell like theres a super high chance that I'm depressed but I do not fucking believe it what so ever. 
I hate trying to talk about how I feel about this stuff to other people because I always feel like its me begging for attention because I'm in eighth grade and I'm used to people talking about their ""depression"" for no reason other than attention.  So I always feel like talking about it is just begging for attention (even though that is a stupid way to look at things because people with real depression do need to communicate and get help) and I always feel bad talking to people about it. 
I really don't know what to do and would like some advice and/or help with this.  I'm also aware that I'm not a very good writer so some of these things lack detail and might just be out of order or not make any sense so if you have any questions fell free to ask so I can try and get you information that you need.  
Just a little bonus but this is my first real post to reddit and I'm not totally sure how things work so yeah.",4
"I'm sure that most people already understand this, but I keep falling back into the same shithole that's depression. The worst part of it is, I still doubt my condition, despite being told several times. Maybe it's because of my extremely young age? Not only that, I still feel I have no right to be depressed. I don't feel obligated to feel sad because I have almost everything good for me. 

I'm a lazy slob with no sense of responsibility or alarm.

At least that's the name I've settled on for now.

Currently, my friends are all sharing remorse over one of their girlfriends getting in trouble for being gay (but that's an entire different story that I won't go into) and I haven't said a thing (we share a group chat online). It's not that I don't care, it's just that I'm scared that my depression will make me sound selfish. I don't want to tell them I'm depressed because it'll likely make me sound selfish. 

Either way, I can't really win right now.

I've been holding back my feeling from them for such a long time (we've all vented to each other except for me as of now) and I don't know how long I can take it.

With that in the way, I've just been left alone, left to be the shut-in I am. 

It's already so difficult to carry a conversation with social anxiety.

I only find comfort online or in virtual/fantasy worlds so all I do is play video games.

I used to be so passionate in drawing because it made me happy, but lately it has been months since my last drawing. 

I'm a disappointment to my parents.

I cost so much money.

I do nothing to benefit anyone.

I feel as if I'm some add-on that you can remove, and everything would still function properly.

This may seem all over the place, but I need to vent once again.

I'm sorry.",2
"I seriously need to vent and would appreciate your opinions

The last months have been pretty rough, but I've been trying to keep it together.
I'm always the one who asks if you're okay, if I could help. 
I'm the one you can depend on, always. My phone's always on vibration, so I can be there for the people around me. 
I really try my best to give as much love to this world as I can, but it's tearing me apart.
It feels like nobody really cares about me and my feelings. Nobody's really interested in me for the person I am. We live in a cold, heartless world and it feels like they're only interested in me, because I'm giving them the security and love they can't get elsewhere.
I'm there for them in their darkest hours, but as soon as the sky clears up, they don't need me any longer.

I'm currently isolating myself from others and from myself/my feelings.

"Friends,

On a throwaway here for now. I had to write/speak to someone so I've decided here is the best place. 

With the New Year approaching, as well as getting back to normality and work after the Christmas break, I feel even more down and worried, particularly about my lack of resilience.

A bit of a background - about 4 months I moved with my partner pretty much half way around the world. It was a move we both definitely wanted and I have no regrets at all from that - however it's again where I think my resilience decided to leave me. I also need to travel weekly (only usually the first three days of each week, so two nights pretty much) for work - it was either that or they said 6 months of little to do within state... I think being bored 9-5 is even more depressing!

Now I'm desperately struggling to keep happy and I have this low to medium level of anxiety that just won't go away no matter how hard I try and think differently. I'm struggling with the flying (I'm already a little anxious but it now feels much worse), I struggle with being alone and away from my other half, I struggle a little with being away from home. The annoying thing is, 6 months ago, I wouldn't care less about being away from home! Or spending time alone!

How do I go about just getting my resilience back and being able to deal with things? I wish wish wish I could be like, oh, so I have to fly out on Monday, big deal, I'll be back soon, make the most of it!

I just want this anxiety to go away and leave me in peace!

Thanks for listening.",4

"Hi all title says most of it, the other day after yet another bad experience with ladies I had a bit of a brake down. Usually it doesn't affect me, at least I thought not. The other day after being rejected by yet another women i had been talking to for a while (6 months and 2 dates). I started to have a bit of a brake down, I had to leave to pub to stop myself from doing it in front of my mates. I started to walk down the road to sit on the harbour edge (just away from the pub). Problem is as soon as I sat down I started to cry uncontrollably, I was overwellmed by negative thoughts and feeling. I felt lonely, depressed and suicidal, for a second I even just debated jumping in. It wasn't till a mate found me and claimed me down that I went back to the pub. Problem is now I can't shake these feeling I stay up late at night thinking about it, i go to places to be alone like the beach just to cry(Yes I know pathetic). I'm on dateing sites and go out to bars/clubs with mates, but I just can't seem to find a girl. I'm shy, overweight and generally just hate myself at this point in life, I have lots of friends both male and older female. They all say I'm great and things like that I'm starting to struggle to believe them. I'm 20 years old and never even kissed a girl, while all my friends get engaged, have kids and get laid. Then there's me and it's just getting a bit much atm, I just wondered if anyone else had felt this way and knows a way to deal with it? As where I'm at atm is not a good place.

"I have MS and I have done everything to pull myself together and build a life. It went ok for half a year but then it started. I was VERY motivated for university, I started my first year of physics major in October and made very healthy habits(eating healthy, sports, morning routines, reading every day, planning the day and week, working deeply without distractions, etc.) and it went pretty good. I didn't expect everything to go perfect, far from it, but I did expect to have some control. But then we had to talk about medicine. My parents are superstitious and I am a sceptic; I think critically and I analyse everything to truly understand the situation. My parents wanted to start alternative medicine and I am fine with that for as long as it is not dangerous as I wish to let my parents be at some ease. They found about this Vitamin D3 treatment which can be VERY VERY dangerous(my kidneys can fail any day) and we had soooo mannyy FIGHTS over it, it was chatastrophic. My mum started to hurt me bad with her shit and dad was just ignorant and arrogant. Moreover, the medicine for MS is VERY DANGEROUS as well, a girl of my age got diabetes and Thyroid Disease so she had to even drop out of fucking musical academy which was her dream just because of MEDICINE. We had countless talks and fights and shit ever since my uni has started and everything has gone to SHIT. All my habits are gone, all my plans are ruined and I probably even have depression now.

You see, when I got the MS diagnosis I spent A WEEK having an existential crisis and I really decided I wanted to be a physicists no matter what, as I felt like that is part of my identity, to truly become a master in something. I have decided to be a physicists roughly a year before that, however now that decision became a huge part of my life. But every time we fought at home I couldn't work for days no matter what; I tried to push and concentrate and I even started going to library to study but after a month even that wouldn't help anymore. I have very good friends, but they are of little to no help and I LOVE my parents, but they try way TOO DAMN HARDDDDDDDD, they are beating my mental health down every day. 

For example: yesterday I was feeling very depressed even though I felt motivated the day before, it just came out of the blue, so I was super slow and lazy and it was impossible to get out of bed. My parents saw that and started worrying, the first thing they said is that I need to snap out of it and that im just pretending because I am lazy, do you know how much that hurt????!!!! But I am rational and I was somehow able to keep my anger and sadness and pool of emotions down to explain them FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME what is going on with me and why is it so but they just wouldn't understand! This time they threatened me throwing me out and you know what, I fucking agreed because I was so desperate that I literally thought that there is no other way. I was SO TIRED that I thought this was my destinity, that im such a pure piece of fucking shit that even my parents want to get rid of me. I just wanted to go and just live my life. I even started planning on how to get a job and shit, it was PURE TORTURE. I have cooled down since then, but now I have not worked for school yet again and I am even more behind, yet fucking again, will it ever end? Why am I even trying with bloody physics which is HARD when I know I have such a terrible condition. I magically passed almost all the midterms and everyone was happy that I did and they kept saying I am amazing and shit, I was so angry because NO ONE understood how much I am suffering because I am not able to learn 10% of what I should be learning, its like being a kid in front of a toy store looking through glass at a toy you wanna sooo desperately have but you KNOW you will never have it. I even tried to talk to a psychologist and it helped the first day and I was so happy that I finally had some real help, but then she said she would call me next week for next talk from the meeting but she never called and it has been a month since then now and I dont even know her name nor can I contact her, she is a psychologist at the hospital! I feel so dead, I don't knwo what to do. Every singe day I fight myself, I fight to gather some energy and motivation to do the work and have fun, but every week is ruined by fighting with parents and now almost every day is ruined by just being empty, dead without energy and tired and with hate for myself and shit. 

I feel lonely, not understood, desperate, without any energy(cannot even have fun, im forcing myself to have fun more than actually having it), im scared all the time, i feel like people just wanna quickly be done with me cuz im a burden, i have insomnia, i sleep too long, sometimes i cant eat at all while on other times i binge eat like crazy and i find myself looking for food every 2 minutes, im scared of studying, im scared of talking to anyone but a professional cuz they wont understand, Im overthinking all the time, i cannot concentrate anymore at all(e.g. got a huge burst of motivation cuz of a fight few days ago and started to work on math but it lasted 15 minutes and then i felt HUGE resistance and my mind went batshit crazy). The only thing missing is the thought of kling myself, but i doubt it will ever cross my mind for more than 5 seconds, as I am rational enough AND I know very well that life is beautiful and valuable. I just CANNOT find a way out of my situation, im caught in this room with walls closing in on myself, but there has to be a way out, but im close to breaking, right now I spend 90% of the time being depressed and then I have these rational outbursts that are seemingly the product of my past self and they seem to protect me and that is why I am here and not dead yet. My healtjh is getting much worse though and MS is getring worse too, ive gotten a new attack a few months ago and it is still active, I cant feel my feet normal anymore, i feel much less and the feeling is weird and its driving me fucking crazy, tho i have gotten a bit used to it. Now I do t even know how I feel about my parents, i fucking love them, but at the same time i hate them for driving me crazy, but i dont blame them, but i still do, but I really really do not know how to feel about them. For new year they were all kind and shit but i cannot take this kindness seriously anymore. I know they mean it but i cannot smile normally i cannot be happy. But i still want to be on good terms with them. What a shitty family we are.

I posted this here to gather some feedback information, new ideas, or new information to help myself because I do not want to give up, ever, for I still believe I can become a physicist, even if it sounds fucking stupid. If there is ONE FUCKING THING that I want to do in my entire life is to research physics and solve math problems. As you can see, I still have MS to deal with, so even if I somehow deal with depression, I will still have this monster over my head which could strike me down any time. For example, how will i deal with a family, I cannot imagine putting such a massive burden on someone I would love, will I ever even have a wife and kids?(I hugely respect what Hawking did and I think it was the right thing to do)

Welp, sorry for this long ass tiresome rant about my life, I know I just stole precious time from you.",3
"Basically, I developed a really big crush on this girl. It was the only time I've ever seen my self being in a relationship. And get this! She had a crush on me too! I was so happy. I was going to ask her out last night at a NYE party, it's the only reason I went. But I missed my chance. Whatever, I'm hanging out with her and some other people tomorrow, I'll ask her then.

Never-fucking-mind.

I got a text from her a couple hours ago. She said she just wanted to be friends. I respected her, I didn't want to be a creep like a guy from r/incels. I told her I got it.

I didn't get it.

She liked me last night. I know she did. And today she didn't. I don't get now feelings for a person could come and go like that. The worst part? One text from a girl destroyed ever bit of progress I've made to better myself since November.

I've been feeling good, maybe happy since then. I've been doing good, been free of self harm. Until today. The only thing that could get my mind of her was pain.

I have to hang out with her and my friends tomorrow. They are probably going to see my fresh cuts.

I just want to be clear, I still want to be her friend. But I still have a crush on her, despite what she made me do. All my old coping mechanisms didn't work. I can't get her out of my head.

I can't stop thinking of it'd be different if I asked her out last night.",4
"My depression has always involved a lot of self blame, guilt, and self hatred, as well as anger and emptiness. I would always take it out on myself, first by throwing myself off my bike once when riding down a hill, then cutting myself, which eventually stemmed into burning, scratching, and punching walls, but recently I've been getting extreme anger towards the people who have hurt me in my past, and especially my old school, where a lot of very bad events happened to me. I'm having urges to sneak in one day (school is out where I live currently) and start smashing windows and breaking computers and just destroying anything I can find in that shithole. I'm past the point of caring anymore, if I get caught and arrested I'll just kill myself, I just can't give a shit about anything anymore, I'm feeling more and more risky and I feel like I have to do this. I really don't know what to do, these thoughts won't stop and I have to do what they're telling me.",5
"OK, let me start this off by saying on the outside I'm laughing and joking to cover these feelings up.


Tired of life
Hard time waking up 
Always fall to sleep using phone (guess it prevents me thinking)
Bad thoughts when lonely
Man even work sucks, I work hard, 80+ hours a week at least and spend longer chasing my wages happened with at least 8 company's within 3 year gap.

Feel like I'm literally hitting my head against the wall.

Within a space of 2-3 months I had third degree burns to feet due to accident not my fault, and when I finally got back to work I now have a hernia. Is this just unlucky?!

Had my palms / cards read by clairvoyant 2 years ago she mentioned my future consists a lot of pain and suffering, didn't want to tell me you could see that in her face.

Even my school days weren't great; debagged in public, constantly hit in testicles throughout school (had to have an operation to remove cyst down there)

Is this depression / anxiety? I just need to get answers to help. No one seems to know how I feel inside, I guess I just hide it well.",3
"I haven't even been to work in 2month because I am so depressed, I don't have any friends and I don't have any family to talk to.. It's like I'm just giving up on everything I have and I don't know why.

"I am a 20 year old male who has 0 friends, never had a girlfriend, and live with my mom.  I dropped out of high school and have no interest in getting a ged. I have social anxiety, severe depression and anger.  I have been suicidal but I know it doesn't end my pain but just end my life.  I don't see myself doing that but I hate being miserable.  We get 1 life and I would like to enjoy it.  I've been alone, not leaving the house much since I was 14.  I have a lot of built up anger, boredom, and just want to enjoy myself.

Getting a girlfriend is one of my biggest goals, but even then, I feel with all my built up anger and depression, I would be very rude and a terrible boyfriend.

Some health problems I have are:
 I have hives called cholinergic urticaria(my skin becomes EXTREMELY painful when i get hot, or stressed, or whenever a person may sweat) It also affects my legs which are extremely itchy so i can't stand for too long.  There isn't really a cure for it.

things I have done the year of 2017 to help my hives and social anxiety:
I eat healthy, take an antihistamine, and exercise which signficantly helped my hives but they are still there and are creeping back.
For social anxiety I went to a psychologist for months and helped slightly but stopped because it wasn't doing anything.  I take paxil and I went from never leaving the house to going on daily walks, family holidays, and the occasional walk in stores.  I still don't have a driver's liscense.

I am also very depressed, I have social anxiety, and I have A LOT of built up anger.

I have seen psychologists, therapist, etc and it just doesn't help.  Talking about my depression does nothing.  The last psychologist helped by answering some questions involving social interaction but didn't help my depression.  I have taken meds and I am currently taking paxil but I am against using anti-depressants.  I am not embarrased by it, but I feel it is unnatural and possibly dangerous in the long run.  

The reason I am here is asking what type of job/career can I pursue with my social anxiety, hives(won't be able to do any physcial work, standing for long periods of time, a lot of social interaction, etc) I feel the best possible way is to work from home or on the computer.  

I have searched and searched and haven't found anything that would work.

A dream job for me is make youtube videos but that is 1 in a million to make a living as well as I don't think I could be entertaining with my severe depression and anger, and social anxiety.

I feel being able to save up money to move out on my own would significantly help my depression.  I hate living with my mom.  I am good at saving and am very cheap.  A studio apartment if fine with me but it seems wiser to buy a house instead.  

Any help is greatly appreciated. ",2
My girlfriend just dumped me. She was the last thing in this world I actually cared about... and now she's just gone. Idk how I can live anymore honestly I feel like maybe this world would be better without me in it.

"After being unemployed for roughly 6 months. 


Can already start feeling myself losing motivation and sloping downwards into my depressed state again. Idk why, I actually don't dislike this job. Over the weekend I had a lot of motivation to be able to fix some things in my life that needs to be fixed.

But now? Now I feel low. No energy. Little motivation. 


Feel like I'll never be able to get out of this loop and live a ""normal"" happy life. ",5
I find when i get more energy while still feeling depressed I focus that energy on orgasms and sex. I find my sex drive is heightened during this time to a beyond normal range.

"Hi everyone I'm new to this sub but I just need some help with my change. 

For two years I have been actively self harming whether it was cutting or doing other bad stuff. I had friends that tried to help but I could never get myself to stop. 

Recently I found myself in a really positive relationship and because I love my boyfriend, I agreed to give him my blades and he promised he would keep them out of reach. I did this because I feel okay knowing they still exist even if I can't get to them. I could never get myself to throw them away.

But now I am so utterly depressed. Cutting was my unhealthy outlet but I relied on it to feel better. Now I don't have any way to release or at least nothing that equates to self injury.

For anyone who has successfully quit cutting, how did you do it? Because right now, two weeks in, I only feel so much worse. ",4
"Hello everyone, 

I've been struggeling with this issue for a long time now. 
As long as I can remember, my mom had an odd way of expressing her love and nurturing my growth. 

I remember when I was 13 she would make me scrub the floors on my bare knees because I didn't help around enough in the house. While doing that she would sing along to a song, calling me a coward and a weakling. 

She also saw me develop my eating disorder but never said anything untill it was too late. I've lost a lot of weight since then and come a long way but she never fails to rub it in my face. Even if I eat an apple as a snack, she would tell me to ""Watch the line"". 

These are just mere fragments of how she is towards me. Recently, I was talking to her about life partners. She flat out told me that, if anyone were to love me, they'd have to choose it very profoundly because I make everyone have a hard time.

Now, don't get me wrong, I did have a rebellious teen period. I just don't know why she can't get a new image of me? Does anyone have tips on how to survive this passive agressive fiesta my mother has? Maybe things I can do to show her how I've changed?

Would it be an idea for me to get some counseling? Pls help me...

"And as much as it hurts and exhausts you, you let them. For me it's because the pain is better dealt with an ""ok"" than them becoming upset at my ""no, I'm not fine"" and starting an argument. It's just what I'm used to - I'm in a loop of an imaginary consistent bell ringing that reminds me to people please.


For you it could be to feel, to feel the pain because you can't feel happiness anymore. Or because of guilt, your own and what others put on you. Or simply, it's because that's all you've ever known.


I'm sorry. I really am sorry. I feel like I belong in a mental hospital with the thoughts that run through my head.

Does anybody else get clingy?",5
"I feel nothing.

I have been feeling like this for a long time. Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes I feel sad, but for the most part I don't feel anything at all. I think the last time I cried was probably 10 years ago.

Two days ago I was watching Bojack Horseman, and one of the episodes hit me for some reason. It was in season two, when Bojack started crying outside the library. Something clicked with me and I started crying too. I was crying for 10, 20, 30 minutes. I just sat there and cried. In silence, alone. I don't know why, but after I stopped, I was happy. I don't think I've ever been so happy before. Sadly, this whole thing lasted only for a brief moment and before long I was back to the cycle of emptiness.

Since then I've been trying to find something to get me into that state again, but nothing even comes close. Sad songs. Rick and Morty. People talking about their life. Nothing. I just sit there and there is nothing coming out of me at all, like an empty bowl. I don't know if ever I will experience that feeling again. I hope I will.

I don't know why I'm typing this. ",5

"I was always ambitious but I became too passionate about becoming a certain thing that when it came crashing down on me that said subject wasn't for me, I died inside. I went into deep depression and rather than identify it and pay off my loans, move on with my life and go to another college, I let myself waste away in the night life. I made a lot of money and never gave it up to my loans. I was bitter and angry and now I have to pay the price by working a retail job. Making a quarter of what I made then. Now people my age are getting engaged, having babies. Everyone is so joyful and I'm so depressed. I don't feel the fellowship at church. Kids my age in the church (again) are in college or are married and I'm over here like a potato. I actually tried to go back! 2 years ago I paid my loans off consecutively for 6 months cause that's how long it takes to get out of default and my adopted parents wouldn't give me the info even though they wouldn't have been paying anything. It's been a constant battle to go back to college. I don't get it. If God loves me, why did he let me sink so low? I know FREE WILL. This sucks. I am so behind in life. I have to pay the price for all my bad choices. I go to bed every night hoping I'll die in my sleep. I have not one genuine friend basically because I never went to college and if I wanted to talk I would reach out to stupid New age events which are all CRAP and idk how I could be so dumb to waste my money on all these retarded Buddhist counselors or whatever they were.

I was diagnosed since 15 years ago with autism (30 yo male BTW). I don't know how I even manage to have 2 long term relationships (2 and a half years everyone) in the last 5 years, now in a third one with my first boyfriend (23 m). Even have I have maintain a job for more than 2 years I don't know how being depressed, obsessive over simple things and even bullied in this one multiple times (some for my sexuality) but learn to deal with that.

I work at costumer service, I literally has to assume another identity in order to survive that day to day and the stress that comes from attend people directly.

I'm pretty much afraid from almost everyone, I think they are going to do me some damage, I think I has PTSD since I was badly beaten with a metal tube and almost killed in a public place back in 2013. I was OK, but since pretty much like march 2016 i begin with constant attacks of anxiety in the work and in public places, I was constantly alert about my surrounds, six month ago, back to June I have my first anxiety and panic attack on a public event with rich people in where my boyfriend was attend to, he almost broke with me then, I go to 2 therapist but they cant do anything with my case, they don't even know how to diagnose me. 
Again my boyfriend try to broke with me mid September, I almost kill myself, come to a mental institution but neglected being interned, but they gave me medication (Prozac and klonopin). I was with two psychiatrist since then, but they still don't know my diagnosis. I finally have a appointment with a specialist on January 3 to validate and see my case to make a formal diagnosis.

But something happens today on the morning (December 31); my boyfriend want to break with me, now this time seriously, I cried, I scream, I have the worst panic and anxiety attack I ever had, he said that he loves me deeply, but when I was with other people (like friends of him) I change totally, my voice, my manners, my way of speak, walking, acting, thinking, even what I speak of changes totally, the worst of this? I don't have consciousness this happens, I remember been there and all but, didn't notice these changes. My boyfriend hates deeply this ""personality"" I don't know of till today.
We talk and talk, he gives me a second chance (even The fact I don't deserve it, but love him so much I don't want he to go). But now I'm afraid, not only by the anxiety and the depression I am, but too from this ""Personality"" I don't even know.

Do you have any Idea of what it can be or what I will say to the doctor on the Tuesday appointment?
Thanks for your help.",3

I feel extremely stressed and bad. I don't have any tests today and anything that could stress me so what the hell? Why am I feeling this way?

When i'm in school nothing bad I think that would happen happened but I still feel bad. Even through ppl talk to me, nothing bad happen I feel worse and worse. Then I have suicide thoughts. Realy big. Actually I may do this, there are so big if they haven't ended after some time. They and bad mood ended when I have nice conversation with friend about makeing cover of Sepultura song. I suddenly stop feel bad and feel happy for few minutes. The thoughts ended but after I came back to my house, when I'm alone I feel bad again. What the hell is happening to me?

Maybe the only reason i care about others is because i want a distraction from my own life. i want out of life, i want to end it all, there' is absoultely no reason to keep going. life sucks. seeing assholes in relationships suck, seeing other people be happy sucks. life sucks and it's not worth living anymore, it's just not.this is the first time I've truly felt like there's no potential upside to life, this is what my life is, it will not get better. i can't live 70 more years of this shit. i don't even want to get through the rest of this year.

"New Year's Day. What a way to start the year, right? I've spent the last few weeks, maybe months feeling worthless and sad and wanting to die but not wanting to kill myself, so I fantasized about getting into an accident and dying in a way that looked like it wasn't on my own hands. I got out of the car with just some whiplash and some bruises but I'm fine otherwise.

It's a miracle I'm alive right now. I spun out on the freeway going 75 mph. I got hit by another car. The witnesses and patrol officer and the EMT all expected me to be unconscious or way more badly hurt than I was. I don't believe in God, but I do think there was a greater force at work, telling me to stop fantasizing about something so horrible and to get my shit together.

So I'm going to. Phone calls give me anxiety, I know I'm going to have a bout of PTSD related to driving, I'm going to feel guilty about wrecking my parents' car, but I'm okay. Everything is okay. Sometimes a wake up call like this is what you need to get better mentally.",3
"To me, depression is a gaping pit I always spiral down into, further into darkness. It's not something you can rid yourself of JUST with a positive attitude, but I'd like to believe that it helps. My reasons for posting this is to vent, but also that someone may feel that they can get something out of this.

So I wanted to write something with the emphasis on that ONE thing I got going for me in 2017, and that I hope to bring with me to 2018. I internalize most things, but I do realize how others have a very strong impact on my well-being, and for the first time, I got some warm feelings.

The new year nothing:

locking in the new year with a lot of bang,

just me and the fam, the sun, the favorite gang

lights and booms all around they rang,

everyone put to sleep, and I'm working on this song

there's nothing new but people make it into a thang,

but that doesn't make it any less true

It's the new year nothing and I still ain't got a clue,

depression is alive in whatever place I lay and hang

hoping for a miracle, but I think that one is you,

stick around to witness, I'm starting something new

caught up with my shadow, the myself that I once knew,

I gotta say, you got me feeling great through and through

it's the new year nothing but now i know what to do,

self-pity was the norm, but now I look foward to

the new year nothing that's bringing me a tattoo,

and for once, i'm done with all this deja vu!",0

"Do you have an animal to help you with anxiety and depression?

I have been finding myself gravitate towards wanting to get an animal to help myself with anxiety and depression. I have two boys ages 6 and 11 and I think an animal would do them well too, my youngest is the biggest animal lover ever and my oldest has always wanted one. 

Do you find them to help with your depression and anxiety? How do? And what do you own?

Thanks.",4
"I have never felt this broken before. My girlfriend and I broke up over a month ago and it hasn't gotten any better. It's probably gotten worse to be honest, going through the holidays alone when I could've had someone with me. I should be feeling great about my life, I'm about to graduate college and begin the next phase of my life. Except I'm not. I don't feel excited about anything anymore. The only thing that routinely makes me happy is my cat, but he isn't enough. I used to be an optimist about nearly everything but I just can't do it anymore. It's hard to be optimistic about the future when your field of study is all about the environment and the incoming administration doesn't give a damn about it. I don't feel like myself. I find joy in making other people happy and all I've been able to do lately is bemoan to them about my problems. I don't feel anything anymore and randomly break down and cry. Sorry for the rant, just wanted to get this out to someone that I haven't already told dozens of times.",4

I'm on SSI because the tumor that I have took most of my cerebellum with it when it was removed from my head. Because I'm stuck being disabled, and living on SSI, I never have the money, or the enegry, to go out and do anything.

I don't know anyone on-line either. Social media is not my thing. I just don't fit in, but that's true in the off-line world as well. I've never fit in anywhere.

"Hello, I'm a 17 yo female high school senior.
So I have many problems, and I'm not going to point each of them out for the sake of keeping this post as short as possible.
I suffer from depression and loneliness and it's getting worse day by day.

Ever since I was in Kindergarten, I was always the odd one out. Honestly though, I don't think I'm at fault here.
Fast forward to middle school and high school, I was/am still alone all the time. Literally.

I'm always alone during recess and I haven't smiled genuinely in 2 years now. I do get happy sometimes but never smiled genuinely.
All the friendships I had just crashed and burned because me and the other person(s) never interacted much in real life or not interacted enough. 

Most of my ""strong"" friendships have been through messaging rather than real life reactions. I have never been in trouble or on an adventure with anyone when those stuff are exactly what makes the base of a real and strong friendship.

Not to mention that I have been made fun of a lot for my taste of music or the way I dress or why I never diet to lose a couple of pounds (seriously, I am fat but not obese.)

And because I went through a lot of difficulties during childhood and early adolescence and I had no one to advice me or be there for me, I've gotten really self conscious and insecure about almost everything. And I'll be honest here, I hate myself so much because of it and I have tried to commit suicide multiple times before.

Getting bullied, being underestimated and looked down upon by your classmates and teachers and also being left alone all the time does make one think ""why? Why am I the only one alone and why am I soooo hated and unwelcome everywhere? Am I such a bad person?"" And all those endless questions and the dark abyss of depression.

I have a strict dad who doesn't let me do most things others my age do and a mom who doesn't want me to defy my dad. Also, financially speaking, I don't come from a rich family like my classmates do but we have enough to live and afford a couple of luxuries.
I love my family so much but they have never understood my problems and struggles which is the main reason why I am the way I am right now. I'm pretty sure if we at least tried to understand each other, not just me but not one of my family members would suffer from a chronic depression and/or have thoughts of dying and committing suicide.
My family don't understand me, they love me but they don't understand me which is why I can't have a real deep conversation with any of them.

Recently, I have found quite a few good people as friends but because we all have our own priorities, we barely see each other and most of the time our interactions are through texts, and that way we won't have a strong and/or real friendship and I also think a lot about it because I honestly don't know what having friends is like... I don't want to be the only one who cares a lot about the others and would go to such extents for them but then after a while the whole friendship crashes and burns.
I want to tell them that I am here to stay but I also know that now is not the time because we have to have more real life interactions and know each other more.

Speaking of my other friendships... The friendships I considered to be real ended up with me being stabbed in the back and left alone with a broken heart.
And I found out that I had no real friends but everyone were just classmates when I considered them to be friends last year when I lost a very dear uncle whom I loved more than both my parents and considered myself to be his daughter, no one had my back then... No one told me to cheer up or at least kept me company until I was strong enough to overcome it.

Right now I am very exhausted of everything... I just want to relax a bit feeling respected and loved a little without worrying about who I am.

I just want to stop hating myself and start loving myself, build up my self esteem.

So tell me, great people of reddit, how do I stop hating myself, deal with loneliness and depression (preferably overcome both of them) and keep these new friendships I have made going without forcing any of those whom I deeply love and care about?

With kindest regards, ",1
"I feel as if I'm depressed but I can't express emotions. My entire life I feel like I've been pretending and imitating emotions I've observed. I feel like some sort of AI trying to pass off as human. I don't feel sympathy towards others but do my best to act as if I do. I understand emotions and know how to reciprocate them but it feels like I'm reading from some book. I feel the emotions sometimes well up inside me but I can't let them out and eventually they fade away into the emptiness. I'm not sure what I can do but I must keep pretending. 

I have hope that I will find purpose and freedom to express myself. I wish the same for you all. ",5
"Prepare for a long read: 

Im only 15 years old so in comparison to most of you i probably have had it easy but i just need to tell my story for some advice because ive been feeling like shit. So lets start off with my past; my parents got divorced when i was 4 years old than my mother got married to another woman and my father also got married again. I went to my fathers house every weekend so i didnt really miss him but when the years went on that changed into 3 hours a week and i really hated the fact i couldnt really be around him. Then in the following 5 years my grandparents died which ofcourse sucked but i never really cried and just put all the emotions aside. When i was 10 my mother woke me up, she was crying and told me that my father killed himself lastnight. He called the day before but i didnt get to speak to him because i was playing in the garden with a friend and whatever i would go to him 2 days later. I cried for probably 5 minutes and then again i put aside my emotions. Also at his funeral i barely cried and it felt terrible but i just wasnt able to cry. Since that day everything went downhill and ive never really been happy. My mother told us that she felt like a man and she got an operation and now looks like a man as well. She and my stepmother than used a spermdonor to get my stepmom pregnant and i got a little sister at the age of 12. I never really talk with anyone about my situation so everyone just assumes that my mother is my dad and my stepmom my mother and ofcourse i cant blame them. Im a very shy, anxious and introvert person. I also aint that good looking but im very smart (i skipped a year and follow the highest possible level of education) and a lot of people say im funny so thats the only thing im confident about. I used to have some really good friends and as a group we were pretty close but then i skipped the year and went to a different class and the contact just stopped and i was alone. Looking back i think skipping the year was one of the things that fucked me up big time because i went from multiple good friends to no friends at all. I never got out of the house and never really talked with anyone. Then i went to high school(idk what its called but you go there when youre +-12 y/o) and one guy of my old class went to that school aswell so we kinda became friends but that died of really fast aswell. Since im pretty ugly and shy there has never really been a girl in my live that really talked to me or cared about me. But 1.5 years ago this girl from school randomly started to text me and it didnt take long till i got feelings for her we went on texting and talking for months and got really close. But eventhough a lot of people told me she liked me i couldnt believe that anyone would ever love me especially since and i never asked her out ot told her how i felt. She isnt really the best looking girl so i didnt really have any competition but she is still far out of my range. I dont want to talk about her too much so i just will sumarise it; went to her sweet 16 where i got drunk, knocked the fuck out and left out of shame in the night. We got close again months later i (unplanned )told her that i always liked her on fucking snapchat and she said she had to think about it. She never answered and im trying to move on and focus on school and work. But i just cant i miss the one friend i always talked to about how i felt and that was always there for me now she just ignored me and broke my heart in pieces. With the stress of school i was already feeling like shit and im really lacking sleep which is making it even worse. Not being able to talk about my emotions with her or anyone else really makes everything worse and my marks and mood are going downwards very fast. I would tell my mother but she has her own problems which she already barleycan handle so that aint an option and i really hate my stepmother so not even gonna bother trying. Especially the last weeks have been tough with last grandmother dying aswell. I didnt even cry when i heard it again i put the emotions aside and now its becoming too much. Christmas and new years eve were terrible and lonely for me since i didnt get invited to anything. Ive really been considering suicide that last few years but those thoughts became more serious last months. Im gonna break sooner or later and then everything will come out and i know it can be the end of me. The last days ive been wondering why i am alive and what my purpose is on this world and if anyone would really miss me when im gone. Any advice on who i can talk about? or how i maybe will feel better? or let the emotions out?",4
"I keep thinking my friends are planning to hurt me. Ever time we hang out I'm convinced they are speaking in code. I get very frustrated when I can't decipher the code. I will eventually get so frustrated that I just demand them to tell me what's going on, which results in them telling me they have no idea what I'm talking about. 

Several times I've thought I was going to be publicly shamed  by my closest friends. I find harsh insults and threats in their speech that they always claim they didn't mean. They always say I'm paranoid and that I'm making everything up. 

On several occasions I thought I was going to be forced to have sex with someone and then later realized I was the only one aware of this.

"I feel a bit better with the drugs out of my system. I spent new year's morning on the beach till sunrise. As the sun approached, rays of orange and blue leapt between low level nimbostratus clouds painting a silky leopard-shaped canvas. Light etched it's way through the aesthetic sky-scape soon finding it's shortest path to the breakers below. I wondered if the love in my chest surfaced by this natural beauty was reciprocal in your heart somewhere.. though on second thoughts I guessed resentment  might occupy most of our space there facilitated by my loathing and misery. Take it as obsession, ill-health, whatever, I can't walk around on a broken leg with a smile on my face. I went in boots and all, young and blind as they come.. 

Here's a thought:
Perhaps staring at your weaknesses in crippling shame and regret is more likely to preserve the good in you than perpetuate failure over and over again, if you manage to recover in time.. That's a relieving thought I guess..

"It'll be 2017 in 49 minutes.

Part of me wonders if I would actually be able to go through with it, or if I'm just being dramatic subconsciously. Mainly my issue here is that I don't want to come off as dramatic to people or insulting to anyone who actually suffers from it before I even ask anyone if I have it. But I feel miserable and malaise constantly, I can barely remember the last time I felt joy or hope of any kind.

I felt I've lost all my motivation and this coupled with other factors (some listed here) have caused me to fuck up my life and future severely. It's come to the point where my life seems so lost that I almost long for a complete failure so I have a prime opportunity to die. I tell myself that the only reason I haven't offed myself yet is because I fear what pain it will cause my siblings, and the pain of loss is what has made me feel this way (I wouldn't want to put this on them or anyone) although part of me thinks it's just fear of death or subconscious insincerity of my thoughts.

"I recently started dating my Deaf friend and she opened right up to me about how she had depression and contemplated suicide a few years ago.

She says she felt like a burden to the people around her.  Having to learn a new language just to talk to her, not listening to her because they don't understand her voice, and not wanting to communicate with her at all.

We watched a movie the other day at my house and she fell asleep on my chest.  I rolled up her sleeve because it was getting caught on my watch, and I saw a massive amount of old scars on her left arm.  I pulled her sleeve right down and just thought for a second.  I've never seen her without a long sleeve shirt or a coat on.  Even though I've been one of her closest friends for years.  She obviously cuts herself, or used to cut herself as the case may be. 



She has apparently been feeling heaps better recently so thats great, she says she learnt to smile, and that she learnt there are people that care for her.   And I believe her. 


But what if this happens again?  What if she has another rough trot?  What am I to do, I feel like I won't be enough to stop her.

Even if she is past this, I'm worried.

Is it normal to be worried?

end of 2016-
i met her (i'll call her megan for the story) through some mutual friends. at the time she was dating one of my best friends (i'll call him danny for the story). so i had a class with megan's bestfriend(i'll call her gwen for the story) &amp; danny, and we all got along perfectly. then suddenly me &amp; megan(she doesn't attend this school) become close friends through snapchat. apparently our sisters are friends &amp; we related a lot through music. well about a month later, gwen &amp; danny aren't aware me and megan are really close friends friends. then at like 2:00 in the morning she sends me a text talking about her feelings for me &amp; not gonna lie i felt the same. we have officially âtakenâ each other, but she still hasn't broken up with one of my best friends danny. well danny &amp; gwen learn &amp; gwen was cool with it. but danny hated my guts. this was like the third time a girl he liked or dated turned to me. i was known for getting his âsloppy secondsâ. me and megan get into an argument &amp; stopped talking &amp; dating.

fast forward about 4 months-
she's at my school &amp; i have a girlfriend at the time. but i really felt megan like really felt for her &amp; i still do... but now danny, megan, and gwen go everywhere together &amp; all 3 hate me. gwen cut me off cause i'm âsketchyâ, danny pretends to be my friend but turn on me &amp; consistently make plans w/o me &amp; megan. i try SO hard to be her friend and it's just not working. she avoids me &amp; it fucking torture. i lost her, and i knew i deserved it. i should've never argued, i should've never said anything. it constantly pains me, watching her smile with all my âoldâ friends. i just need advice or help. i just need a glimmer of hope.",4

"I'm jacob. I'm 16 years old and I live in Minnesota. I'm posting this because I believe I had an intense moment of clarity while I was stoned. (Not the good kinda stoned) I mean where it was just too much. 

    So my buddies came over to my house yesterday. I'm usually not depressed but just a little lost sometimes. Just every once in awhile I'll get depression that will last from a day to a week usually. And one of them brought some really potent weed. And we were gonna do it both days of new year ( New Year's Day New Year's Eve.) 

    So last night was New Year's Eve. And we were smoking it. One of them didn't,  it was just two of us and we were out in my old broken pickup truck freezing and smoking weed with a lighter with almost no fluid but it worked. A bottle and a 3/4in socket pressed into a water ballon filler as the bowl. It looked stupid but it worked. And we honestly had a fun time laughing about how stupid it seemed how other were inside and we're sitting in an old pickup truck smoking weed out a bottle. That night was fun, just sitting around chilling.

    So the next day was not as fun. We were smoking some now in the morning. We smoked like 2 full bowls with low tolerance. And we were so stoned we were freaking out. It was not fun and felt very depressing and lost. The buddy that brought it had a little more than me and he got sick from it. I didn't but it certainly felt like it. While I was sitting in the other living room coming down. It suddenly struck me that I'm a nobody. That all these things that I do are not what I want to do.

    It's about school is what my realization was about. It's a pretty small school so that's nice. But that's not what it's about. It's because I always talk about how I want to drop out and all about what shitty jobs I'll have to work. And I think if I drop out then I can just sit at home and play video games and live in those games in my head. But I realized sitting there that I was wrong this whole time. It's laziness that making me not do work and not give a fuck about school. I suddenly felt that I didn't want to drop out, how I wanted to do the school work. To not be shamed for what my opinion is about it. I feel that I have just already thrown my life away. I have all Fs in classes. And I feel I just need to do better because I haven't been trying one bit all school year so far. I feel I need to change it all then I think I would be happier. 

    I'm probably not making sense at this point my mind is still somewhat foggy cause I was like tripping for awhile from the weed. Btw I don't smoke that much just every once in awhile.

    But now I'm asking for your advice on what I should do and tips to do it. I feel like I can't but I know I have to try.

    I think if I finish school and graduate. I could do what I want then. Have a place to call home. Work a job and then when not working just have fun then like video games as an example I suppose. Just thinking about how I could have my own home and to love myself and not be ashamed that I'm throwing my life away.

    I wouldn't have to be throwing my life away if I don't throw it away. Please send some advice. Thanks

    Tldr. I had a moment of clarity about how I'm just throwing my life away but I can fix it if I try.",3
"If you dont believe in Karma, you will after this story. This is a story of my year of how I lost everything that makes me happy. I have never been good around people... I mean awkward around others. I hate being this way, but society will not let me change. I try to but I always end up here... ALONE. I had it all until Jan. 2016. So like I implied before, I never had many friends in reality but I did online. I played Xbox a lot (too much) but it was where I was happy. I had an adequate amount of friends there, but I had taken it all for granted. I treated my friends on Xbox like shit. They were the best friends I had but pride consumed me. On one bad day, I had been informed we do not have unlimited internet anymore.This was devistating because the happiest moments of my life was here. This was in January when this had happened. I managed the best I could. This hurts me the worst because this ruined my dreams of being a gamer on Youtube. We still had internet but limited.
      So the month is now March, I have met a very beautiful girl, and I wanted to ask her out but I didn't want to rush anything ( This was an excuse because I was scared). I tried to gain the courage to ask her out everyday. So lets skip to next month (April), I finally gained the courage and did it. The answer was maybe. I should have just given up there, But I was in denial. She manipulated me for a month until she said no. Life was living hell for awhile.
     So after I tried to get my life together, the month is now June. I was now going to pursue my Youtube dreams. I was blindly happy for awhile. I told myself me videos were good... looking back I lied to myself. With limited data means limited quality. The only subs I got was my friends. After about a month of regular posting, my videos got a little better. I was somewhat happy until I lost all of my friends on Xbox. I know I am the only geek who had best friends on Xbox but they were. I don't blame them. I treated them like shit.  After this I just lost all hope and care. I posted about 2 more videos then I lost all my motivation. I was truly ALONE.
     After this I started to learn more about programming. I love computers. The more I learned about programing, hacking, etc. the more alone I felt. Around this time school started so I couldnt program as much. I absolutely hate school. They say High School is the best years of your life, but I say Bullshit.
     So time passed and the time is December 2016. I still played games but not as much. They are the only thing that made me happy. I see it as alcoholics have boose and I have games. I was so alone that I played cs:go in offline mode. Cs:go took up too much data so I didnt want to play online. I felt invincible online at times when I was programming. One dark day my pc gets hacked. I lost over a years worth of code. Ironically at this time I was making a very strong firewall that was almost finished. The hackers stole the code for my firewall program. I had to get a new OS         (operating system). I lost my games too. I cant get them back either. I am left with nothing.
      This is the conclusion of this story. I am not going to commit suicide. I do feel numb and emotionless. I smile and laugh sometimes but it is just a mask of numbness. This is my story of 2016 and how all this contributed to my depression. I do have few friends outside in reality but I had really good friends online too. I am lost in life now. I do not have dreams anymore. I do not know what to do. I wrote this because I have been keeping this bottled up for the whole year. I take full responsibility for my actions and I think I deserve what has happened to me. Hell I treated my friends in reality like shit too.  I thank you for reading this.

"I was wondering if anyone else gets really fucking sick of people complaining about specific years and shit due to one awful thing that happened to them that year. No year will ever be perfect, each will bring bad things, so why is it that the entire population complains about specific years like they were the worst fucking thing that ever happened to them? It's hard for me to put what my thoughts are into text on this issue but basically what I'm saying is that years are just a measure of time and it's really dumb to waste your memory trying to remember which are good and which are bad.

I get really pissed around new years because all I fucking hear is people talking about how a year was amazing or shit due to fucking 3 or less events that happened during it.

Sorry for swearing a lot I know it makes me sound idiotic.",5
"This last year, I decided to get help for what I thought was depression. Turns out it was. I opened myself up to somebody for the first time in years and ended up getting my heart broken amongst one of the worst depressed periods in my life. It's been a lot of picking myself up, so much so where I think I'd rather just lay on the ground forever at times but I'm hoping this year doesn't fucking beat me when I'm down like 2016 did. Anyway, rant type thing over.",3
Like i have a ok life im homeless right now its not the first time i have some fake friends not first i have little family my mom died a couple weeks ago (im 14) all this stuff is bad but im kinda use to this i losted all energy to live yet i cant kill myself because i know i would hurt maybe 2 or 3 people idk anymore haha,4
"warning: fairly negative post. 

Feeling lonely &amp; not having friends used to bother me a lot. I thought having people reaching out &amp; caring about me would help me feel better about life. 

   Then I started a program in college where everyone is really ""tight"" with each other. So now I'm not totally isolated like going weeks without talking to people, like it was before. 

   These people are nice, fun &amp; share the same interests as me. There's no reason I couldn't be friends with them. But these relationships don't make me not want to erase my existence anymore, or pull me out of a shell, more confident, cheerful every once in a while, ad nauseum. It's not that they're ""not enough"" or something, it's just that nothing can fix me.

   I guess this past year has really proven that to me. That element of ""I wish ____ would just contact me, it would prove I'm not worthless and someone cares"" is gone, and it's honestly a relief. Kind of like sinking into a somewhat comfortable void. But it definitely scares me for the years to come.  

   I'm supposed to live for 60+ more years like this? I'd rather not.

"I don't have my own work space so I have to do all my work and gaming in the common room with everyone. I don't have a job or friends that I can call and go places with, and I can't afford to move out anytime soon.  
My parents still act like I'm 15 years old and if I ever want to go somewhere they have to know where, with who, and for how long. So there goes any hope of dating, because I'm not one to talk about that stuff with my parents, and if they found out I was dating someone they *would* force me to answer questions I don't want to discuss with them.  
And then there's the constant fighting over literally everything. I'm walking on eggshells to avoid triggering my mother, and everyone knows it but nobody will talk about it. I know she raised me and all but she acts batshit sometimes.

I have depressive episodes where I can't get out of bed, feel numb towards emotions, want to be left alone/don't want to talk to people, unproductive. But I also feel like I have high anxiety? But the anxiety usually comes as a result as the unproductiveness (i.e. late/rushed assignments). ",5

"So I was recently on Snapchat. Well...my sister was. And she came across something, like a reading for 2018. Reading mine, I really thought about what it said. It actually got to me. It said to strengthen ties with friends and that they can support or help you. But...why? How would it know that I'm going through stuff? Idk...it just confused me. Maybe I should tell people about how I feel. Maybe I do need help. I've spent my life holding everything in. From tears to rages of anger. But now...I feel like I've hit a breaking point. I've felt like I've had hit points like this before but they're nothing compared to this. I'm just really confused and I can think straight. I feel alone and scared of the world, scared of myself. I hate myself to the point where getting off the bus for school gives me so much anxiety I could start crying. I always feel judged, my friends are starting to fade. Maybe that's why I need to strengthen the ties with them, so I don't lose them. I just hope the year ahead can be better than the previous. I need my life back, I don't want to keep living like this.

"I'm here to share my feelings. What does it mean when you get a sudden pang of sadness that refuses to leave n leaves you wanting to cry for now reason?  I've googled it and it's given me three reasons 
1. Hormonal imbalance. 
2. Anemia.
3. Depression. 

Let me tell you a bit about myself. 
I'm Li, female, 20 years old. I've had my fair share of ups and downs in life. I was in a bad relationship for almost a year before I found the person I actually wanted to be with. But the situation in which I got into a relationship with him was rough you could say.  You see he was my best friend and I didn't want to loose him. He'd liked me for almost 2 years at that time and I knew I'd loose him forever if I kept him waiting.  But know I'm very happy I did because it's the best thing that ever happened to me.

The person before him, was the worst choice of my life, but not the first worst choice.  I've made two wrong choices in life that I regret. 

1. My ex. Initially all was fine and I liked the time we shared together. My feelings started to get strong until I was stuck in a place where I thought I couldn't be able to live without him. But sadly his feelings were the total opposite. As time went by he started losing interest. He did cheat on me, three times. I was stupid to keep on giving chances to him. He knew I was all his and maybe that's why he started taking me for granted. And that's when things got bad. I know I'm not a good person and I've done some things too but I'm sure I was all loyal.
He started getting abusive. 

Valentine's Day '14. I was 16. We lived 6 bus stops away and it took time to get to him. Traffic made it take even longer . When I got there he was pissed because I took so much time. He grabbed me by the arm and started calling me names i'd gotten used to at that point. We walked until we reached darker and empty streets. We didn't talk to each other. We held hands. His grip was tight, squeezing my fingers together. We reached a house that looked like it was empty. All the lights were out. It wasn't his house, just a random house. We went in through the gate and to the side of the house so that it hid us from the main road and from any neighbouring house. Basically we were hidden from the world.  He started kissing me hard. His hands were on my shoulders. I was pinned to the wall. I tried to move but he was heavier than me, even though he was as skinny as a stick. I was uncomfortable. I didn't kiss him back. He got pissed, called me a slut, said I was cheating on him. The usual. Then it came. The first slap. It was hard and sudden and unexpected. I didn't know what was happening. I was crying at that point. My mouth was shut with his hand. His other hand moved down. Kissing me on my neck Now, biting and sucking . I'd had enough I wanted to go home. I told him to stop. I'd had enough, I kept telling him to stop. He didn't. But I didn't stop.  He got irritated I guess or IDK. Came more slaps. And a final push to the wall. And he walked away.. 
I didn't know my way back home, my way to the bus stop that would take me home. I was alone. My heart was crying. I found my way back, went home. Texted him again and again apologizing. I thought he hated me I thought he'd break up. I couldn't bear that idea. I was in a bad place.

"Hi! Was just with my therapist and she suggested that when depression says âisolate yourself from your friends and family', do the exact opposite. Seek them out. When anxiety says âavoid all your problems', face them head on. Depression has a way of convincing you that only the worst things are true. Tell your inner saboteurs to kindly fuck off! You deserve much better.

This is much easier said than done, but if you're like me and you enjoy being a contrary little bitch, be a contrary little bitch to depression!",5
"I often go to bed at 3-4am and wake up at 12-2pm. I know this is terrible, probably unhealthy, and also when I have to wake up early (for appointments and things) it's the worst. 

And it doesn't help that when I am trying to sleep, it's hard because I'm plagued by thoughts about needing a job, not putting enough work into school, what people think of me, that's to impossible to be with that girl I like because all I know about her is from twitter, how I'm a terrible creepy stalker weirdo for crushing on some random person on twitter, you know, the usual stuff.

But when I'm in bed after 12, and I'm watching a movie, or playing a game, or whatever, it's the only time I can REALLY relax. 

I'm currently a college student, so this schedule works for the most part. There are lectures and things I have to attend, but those are often later in the day so it works out. 

I live with my big family, (I'm an introvert, as if that wasn't obvious.) and while yes, I'm able to do things by myself or alone, it still feels... I don't know, not as relaxing? It's like I'm half relaxing, but the other half isn't.

Again my family's big, and most of them are loud. I'm a quiet anti-social shut in, so naturally I spend a lot of time at my desk where my desktop is.... and pretty much everything else. This is setup in the most popular room in the house, so even if I'm doing something by myself and alone, 95% of the time there's *atleast* one other person in the room.

Like I said, they can be loud, playing games, talking to online friends (jealous), and younger kids running around and playing. My two little brothers (both under 11. For reference I am 20) adore me, which is great, I love them too.... but the problem is that means they love to come a visit me, talk to me, play in the same room as me, etc.

It just feels like I never can relax... until everyone else is in bed, and I can do whatever I want and not have to worry about anything. 

**It's like living is my job, and when I get into bed is when I finally get off work.**

My therapist is telling me ways that I can get my sleep schedule to be more normal, so that way I can have more time in the day, but I was thinking about it and... why would I want that? I never feel fully comfortable in the day, and late at night is when I can finally just forget about everything. So why would I want to take that away? I'm mean sure I'll get a lot more done, but if I have to sacrifice the only time I can fully relax, is it worth it? ",2
"Hi Reddit. I don't know where to turn so I'm posting here.

Ever since my break up a month ago, it's been very hard to feel happiness.

We were together for more than two years and it was one of those relationships where we were very close. We depended on each other very much and were each other's best friends. I have a very hard time meeting people and making friends but I was totally happy to just spend time with her all the time. Literally my ""me time"" that I relished in before the relationship became ""us time"" and it felt good and right for me. We told each other we were in love before the relationship officially started and while I think the feelings of love morphed and changed and were periodically lost over the course of the relationship, she was always my best friend in the world. I trusted her completely and her company was all I needed.

We traveled all around together. Last summer we worked seasonal jobs in Alaska and then headed to the Grand Canyon after that to work through the winter. We had all these plans that I was so excited for and I was so happy to be able to have that experience with someone I was so close to. Nothing seemed off about the relationship and I trusted her so much I didn't think to question a new ""friendship"" with a guy she worked with.

Fast forward to a month ago and she wakes up one morning and tells me she hasn't been very happy being with me for a few months now and that she's developed feelings for this dude. I was totally shocked and blindsided. My entire world was turned upside down. Everything I enjoyed about life was suddenly gone and I was completely alone. She moved on without so much as a second guess like it was nothing. I found myself in a very shitty situation and I ran back home to my parent's house.

My self esteem is completely gone. I feel worthless, replaceable, unimportant, unattractive, and used. All the plans we made together are now hers and she's carrying them out with her new fuck buddy, like I was never even there. Everything I wanted for this winter is completely gone. I feel as if my life was stolen from me. These plans meant so much to me and they were suddenly hijacked. I feel like I'm stuck back where I started. My life has changed so much since I met her and I have no idea how to continue that without that type of relationship with someone. I want to get back out there and get a new job somewhere and travel again but I'm terrified to do it alone. Happiness is only real when shared after all.

The result is I've been severely depressed. I barely eat. I only get up to smoke cigarettes. Nothing at all that I used to enjoy gives me any pleasure. Conversations with old friends and family do not stimulate me at all. I cannot feel a single modicum of happiness. I feel either depressed, angry, insecure, or anxious at all times. I literally have not felt a single positive emotion since we broke up. It's been a month now. There are no ""good days"" along with the bad ones, there are only and always bad days. I strongly fantasize about suicide on a daily basis. I don't want to, and I doubt I will, but the thought of all my problems disappearing and not existing anymore is one of the few gratifications I can derive in this state of mind.

All I do is obsess over her and what she's doing and think about our old times and what should have been and go over every reason I hate her in my head over and over and over and over again. Today I sent her a million nasty texts to try to get under her skin and make her fight me. She just told me to go fuck myself and to stop texting her and that was that. I hyperventilated and got in the shower and punched the wall over and over and cried and screamed.

I feel I am unwell and I do not know what to do.

Sorry for the long post.",4
"I'm so fucking stupid.  I should've kept pretending like everything was ok.  I finally opened up to 2 of my best friends about how I've been suicidal recently.  They got really upset and started telling me how selfish that is, and they're right.  I knew they've both dealt with suicidal thoughts before, and it was insensitive to bring it up around them.  Since then they stopped talking to me.  I've never felt worse about myself and dealing with it alone isn't helping.  At this point I'm ready to die.  I'm failing out of school, I can't start a relationship, my autism is getting worse, and I won't even have a place to live next month when I turn 18.  My one reason for not ending it already were the few friends that I did have, but now they're gone too, so I don't have a reason to stay alive anymore",3
"Hello. So I would like to preface this by saying that I have not been formally diagnosed with depression, but I figured this subreddit would be the best place to seek advice nevertheless. I hope you don't mind me. 

For a while now I have not been able find the motivation to do much of anything. When I have a break from school I mindlessly click through useless videos on Youtube or various useless articles. Virtually nothing holds my attention. I can't get through an episode of a tv show without reading something else. I can't read through interesting articles, I can't finish any books, I can't draw, I can't do any research or even clean my room. Essentially, I can't accomplish anything unless it pertains to a greater purpose than simply enjoyment, or if I have made myself accountable to someone else, and even then I have trouble finishing tasks. It was honestly difficult for me to get out of bed and shower for the past couple of days. I am on winter break currently. 

What makes me the most afraid is that I haven't been thinking-- especially thinking creatively. If I have a new idea to ponder, I never pursue it. I used to constantly be thinking of new art projects and writing prompts, even though they never came to fruition. In school, I am ridiculously bored. I am lucky if I pay attention for ten minutes straight in any of my classes. My grades are fine, however. 

Could I have some advice, please? I am saddest about my lack of curiosity. Even when there was nothing interesting to do, I always had my imagination, and now I am bored with my own mind. Anything you can say to help would be greatly appreciated. ",2

"Just a quick rant about my problems to make me feel better and get some weight off my chest. Each paragraph is sorta it's own thing.

I'm almost 16, in high school, getting over losing a girl I love(d) because she cheated on me a while back and was really toxic even though we were crazy for each other. I'm actually doing okay though. That's not my worst problem.

I have it really good. My family makes really good money, super stable job, nice little cozy home, never moved, happily married parents that I have great relationships with and I get privileges like being born a tall white male in the suburbs/country in the best country in the world but yet I'm not happy.

It's not that I'm sad, I just feel numb to things. I don't get a feeling like my brain's active and happy. Is this what depression is? I feel dry and stale. 

My health is bad. I'm a type 1 diabetic; ever since I was 6 and ever since I've been a teen it's been really out of control. It's fucking with me mentally and the constant high blood sugar does physical things to mess with your mood too. 

Because of my diabetes I can't do the only thing I've ever been good and passionate about, be a marine. It's entirely off the table. It feels really hard having this sometimes. But I think about how I could have cancer or HIV while starving in Africa as an orphan with no education and it just makes me feel like a pussy. Pride and integrity are important to me but I really do just feel shitty all the time and feeling bad just makes me feel bad so I feel worse and so on.

I feel so numb and like, hyper aware and lacking of those good chemicals in your brain. My whole life I always wanted to go hunting. The first time I ever killed a deer it was a great experience on paper, but I felt like I was acting being happy the whole time. I didn't feel much excitement and it broke my heart. I wanted to be out there with everything in me, but it was like I had played this level of the game over and over, even though it was entirely new and âexcitingâ.

I hate school. It's where I get all of my social interaction, sure, but in reality it's a horrible attempt to teach on a massive scale, and it's like a holocaust for young mental health. I'm smart but I feel like my brain cut me off 100 steps up a 1,000 step mountain. I feel unmotivated and limited to what I know I can do. I used to be a really good student and this year I literally just don't do anything even though I'm in the upper level classes.

And even if I did great in school, what's it for? I don't feel interested in doing much else. 

I would never hurt myself in anyway. But I really do wonder what I'm living for sometimes; even though other times I can't fathom how I'd feel that way, and I force myself to be positive and like myself and feel a little better.

I don't like myself. My hair is really bad and I can't fix it really, I think I'm gonna go bald, I just don't like my face much, I hate complaining about this this shit and feeling bad in my situation. I don't know if my personality is who I want it to be.  I wonder what I'm getting up every day for sometimes.",4
"  I have been adding to this regularly.   It has just become kind of a therapy thing for me.   So, I get if no one reads it.   If you do, I'm open to comments and suggestions.   If not, thank you for your time. 

  About 4 months ago,  the (39f)woman (37m)I love of 10 years went from ""I love you"" to ""I'm blocking you"" in the span of a week.  In a text at that. I have tried reaching out to her, but received only venom in return.  She was my life, my happiness, my fiancee,  and my drive. 
  The back story is long, and while I would love support and ideas, I don't really expect anyone to read this or care.  I just have no friends,  nor am I good at making them.  So, this is the only Avenue I can think of to try, nor am I a good writer.   Also,  this is on my phone,  so sorry if I miss any autocorrects.   So, here goes, it will be long, but, as this is more because I don'tknow what to do,  understanding would require a good amount knowledge of me.  While this is long, sadly,  it's only scratching the surface. 
  I suffer from depression and anxiety.   In the military is was diagnosed with Bpd.   I have never been popular or had many friends.   I try here and there to make them, I usually wind up being the target for people to make fun of.  It has become a place in life where I just fit in.  The doctor said my depression will never go away, and all I can try to do is mitigate. 
  To start, I was conceived due to my mom's depression.   While I was due in December,  she decided to force labor in Oct.   Unfortunately,  I lived.
  When I was 13, my parents divorced over drugs.  Both were in a bad place.  My dad told me if I didn't go with him, he would kill himself.   So, being a child,  I chose to live with him.  At that point,  we moved around to the point due to his contract labor,  I went to 17 highs schools.   Making friends became impossible.   
  Because he was strung out.  He was making me pay rent to live at home at 16.  My mom would not let me go with her because she was bitter.   So, went to school and worked full time.  Until I turned18, and joined the military 5 days later.
  In the military,  people come and go all the time.   So, I didn't make friends because,  well, I was used to that.  However,  I wound up being made fun of regularly .  Mainly because I liked to read dungeons and dragons books to escape reality.
  I went out and met a woman,  who I dated for 3 months before making the mistake of marriage.   While I was out to sea, her and her boyfriend cleaned out my life savings of about  $30,000.   I flew home for us to transfer unawares to ""here's the keys to your truck, I want a divorce,  goodbye.""
  I moved because I had to.  And met a girl who thought it was a fun game to mess with me.  Cheating and coming back crying.   Because of this,  I used to sleep with a loaded shotgun pointed at my head.   Finally,  one night, I was getting drunk and ready when.  When I had the gun in my mouth,  someone walked in,  and called the cops.  So I spent a while in the hospital. 
  I then met a different woman who got pregnant. So, I married her (46f)so she would have insurance for the baby.  Which was my oldest daughter.   The wife quickly got pregnant again and had my son just before I was out of the Navy.  She was from Texas, so when I got out, after 7 years in, we moved to Indiana.
  In the need to find work,  I took a truck driving job, where I received a letter in the mail that I had a 10 year old son.  Long story short,  the girl who took my virginity had gotten pregnant and never told me. I was hammered with support and much back support,  putting me in a position where I lost everything.   The woman only wanted the money,  and while I get I did the deed, after 10 years, I had made many choices this knowledge would have impacted greatly. 
  The wife, knowing I loved my children,  would then cheat on me regularly,  always threatening to take my kids away to texas if I didn't like it.   By this point,  I made little working in customer service.   So, I couldn't afford a lawyer.   And in Indiana,  men never get the kids.  So, she did whatever she wanted,  virtually holding me hostage to my kids.
  Then, I met this (39f)woman.  We became best friends.   She was engaged to someone outside the country.   We would sit and talk for hours.   We did everything  together,  and our kids did things together.  We actually had everything in common.      Her new husband,  wound up being a lazy mommas boy.  And while she tried over the next couple of years ,  he just couldn't be motivated to...do anything.   She then while I didn't notice,  started doing things for me like dying her hair blonde. 
  Her and I decided to try to make better futures,  so we went to ITT together.   After class, always talking for hours.   At this point we had known each other for roughly 6 years.   One night however,  it hit me.  Where I accidentally told her I loved her.   I knew I thought it,  I guess,  in a way where it wasn't my active thought,  but, I guess I didn't realize how powerful it was.  
  Some back story on her.  She grew up being made fun of also, suffered from depression,  and had a rather uncaring mother.  Her first husband who fathered her children abused her, and the second took advantage.   When I tried to make more friends,  she got upset.   So when I talked to her about it,  she preferred it to just be us.   Once I understood,  I complied.   More people meant more chances of getting hurt.  Once she felt someone hurt her, nothing mattered, they were the enemy.
  Over this time,  there was never a time she called me for help i didn't come running.   I actually liked helping her.  Seeing her smile,  just...made me feel good.    From helping her find a place to live,  to mowing her lawn because her husband couldn't be bothered.   I never once told her no.
  After I told her I loved her (call her k), with my wife being pregnant again,  things changed.   She told me she loved me.  We spent hours discussing it.  Like fate brought us together .  The wife, who had had more boyfriends,  one who's wife got her fired I believe got pregnant on purpose so I wouldn't leave.  I work, I pay bills, and I have nothing I can do about it. 
  I talked to the wife, and she agreed to let her move in for a 3 way relationship.   K then left her husband who moved back home,  and moved in with her and her kids.  This was not a bad thing until the wife got jealous.    I spent my time with k, letting her do what she wanted,  but anytime I was happy,  it made the wife upset.  So, eventually things bored over and k moved out and in with her mother. 
  The wife went back to her ""other"" friends while still threatening me regularly.   The relationship with k became mostly by phone and weekends since she was now an hour away.   Also complicated with poor Internet at her mom's, so messages didn't always get through.  Sometimes having to send multiple before she would get the notice.  This continued for a couple of years.   Though,  any time she told me she needed me I was there.   Bringing her and her kids with us anytime me and my kids did anything.  Hell,  if she wanted anything,  I would jump through hoops to try to make it happen.  To be honest,  anything that made her smile, made my day.  Our love, and friendship was what kept me going.   K also became attached to my youngest.   
  Before my daughter came, this year I was planning for a divorce as my kids would be old enough to choose.  And support for my son ended. However,  a couple of lawyers told me a judge won't split the kids, so she would get them. Then I wouldn't be able to stop her from moving back to texas. 
  So, in March, k told me things needed to change,  and she gave me some rules.   Like no ""relations"" with the wife.   I think I understood what she was wanting.    So I came up with a plan to give her what she wanted.   K was going through some rough times.   I had to give her what she wanted without stressing her out.  So, I didn't tell her about it. 
  I spent the next six months in solitude in the bedroom.   The wife sleeps in the den.  I needed to do a few things.  Make it easier on the kids to move away from me by making them indifferent towards me.  Make it easier on me by getting used to not talking to them so much.   Then buy time for support for the other child to end.  While having time to talk to a lawyer,  and start preparing for a divorce. 
   I checked with k regularly in order to be sure we were good.   For I was going stir crazy.  I ended up stressing out k.   I didn't realize that even though I grew up alone, how much being around her regularly meant to me.   Right at a time when her work and kids made seeing each other difficult.   I'm sure I was driving her insane.   I was trying to protect her, and in doing so screwed up.  I got jealous she was talking to her ex husband.  Jealous over trying to get time with her.  
  She was having trouble with the relationship with her son, problems at her underemployed job, car problems,  problems with money, among other things.   So I set out and worked on getting her a job that would have started last week that would have paid double what she was making. 
  In August,  support was over, I set up a date with her.  I had this big dinner planned.  Ready to tell her everything,  ready to tell her I was about to give her everything she asked me for.   I was as excited as anyone can be.  She canceled the first time because her son wanted to do something with her.   Since she was working on building a relationship with him, I got that.
  The next week was my son's birthday,  which I checked everything with her.  She promised everything was fine, that she was ready for us to finally be together,  and she loved me and we made love.   So I made plans for the next weekend with her, for telling her everything.    A couple of days later, I got into it with a lady from work to the point we were yelling.   I went to smoke to calm down, with a text telling me she was canceling because her son just made his first girlfriend and her family invited her over for dinner. 
  I screwed up.  I called and asked if she was blowing me off again.   She hung up.   So I screwed up again and called back like 20 times.   Finally,  we talked.  I apologized.  Then, that Sunday,  we're were texting and she just disappeared.   I sent a few messages over a few hours tryingto reach her.  One, my youngest wanted to talk to her, two, I wanted to tell her about a show, and 3, I wanted to remake plans to tell her about everything, that everything she asked me for was coming true.
  I woke up to a text, that I was smothering her, and that she was done with me and blocking me.   I was lost.   I tried to explain,  but was blocked before I could.   We had been best friends for 10 years.  Lovers for 4.  And all I got was a text.  I tried emailing from a couple of different addresses.  Sending flowers.  She told me to fuck off, and stop being a stalker.   
  I let the wife read my emails to her.  So she understands I will no longer be held hostage.  However,  k never either read them or cared.  She just went 180Â°.  I've never let anyone..in before.   It only meant pain.  She said I was a manipulating controlling jerk.  But, I never didn't do anything she asked.  Ever.  I wasn't allowed to question her, so, I just complied.  I didn't mind, except like anyone,  I can get emotional,  and at times had trouble not asking questions. Her love was worth it. 
  We used to sit and talk all night.  About anything and everything.   We would sit on the porch,  and talk from sundown to sunup.  She became part of me.  Part of my every thought.   We had everything in common.   Most people thought she was my wife. When we were physically together,  the world was good.    She was going to be my only support in losing my kids.
  Now, I sit here, having given up everything for her, and she will never probably speak to me again.  I love her.  I wasn't depressed when she was around.   I have no friends.   I have no outlets that don't make me think of her.  I have nothing.   I never got to tell her, because I wanted to protect her.  My depression has drove me back to drinking.   I can't afford therapy.   I don't have anyone in the world who cares.  
   If anyone actually read this.  I'm the type that ""everything will work out"" is just empty words.  Fate I believe meant for me to be with her.  I no longer know what to do,  or how to continue. 
  All doors are closed.  I can't seem to find an open door anywhere.  I'm broken.   I'm worthless.   I'm having trouble finding reasons to not end it.  I wasn't supposed to survive being born anyways.   My life insurance would help set the kids for life.  She was everything to me.  After a lifetime of being made fun of, people hurting me, she broke through and made me feel human.  Now, this is gone.  No explanation,  on a text.  I must be worthless to throw away that easy.
  
  This is just more details.    Adding on as I go.  Maybe someone can help me.   Or, maybe my story will make someone else feel better about their situation.   Either way,  I'm laying it all out there.    

  The job.
 
    I explained earlier that k also suffered from depression.   She did the cutting thing.  I won't say I don't understand as over the last few months,  I have considered it.  We spent a lot of time discussing our depression.   Going over the ups and downs.   She had been mistreated by family and the men in her life.  I made her a promise to not be on that list. 
  When we worked at the same place, we made one hell of a team.  She always had the best evaluations.  Right up until our new auditor made a mistake,  took it to our new boss, who was prone to jumping the gun before understanding the situation.   So she was let go.  This crushed her confidence.   While I was able to later research and show it was an error on their part, it was too little too late. 
  Then she had a period of unemployment,  being turned down for various positions.   As I watched her fall apart,  all I could do was comfort her.  Always reminding her how awesome she was.   Though,  she quickly became numb to me telling her so.  Then she took a position as a security guard just to pay the bills.   Totally underemployed.   All I again could do was try to remain positive for her.  Reminding her how amazing she was.  However,  she started to reach the point where she felt like it was the best she could do.  Knowing she can run circles around most everyone in almost any type of analytical work, it was not easy to watch.
   A few months later,  I was let go for much the same reason.   I got lucky and found a good position in production logistics analytics.   While she was happy for me, well, you know.  
  Then she called me up telling me she was done with her current job due to b.s. she was dealing with.   Then she was fine with it.  Then she was done again.   I didn't know whether to push or what.   Push too much,  she would get angry.  Don't push,  I'm not helping.   She means the world to me.   Not an easy spot to be in.
   Honestly,  she's better than me at everything.  So, after I had been here for a while,  I just happened to report to a plant manager.   While I'm on good terms with the other plant manager.   I'm also good at my job.  So when I told them I knew someone better,  they were very interested.  However,  she doesn't think she interviews well.  So, I worked out something awesome with my plant managers.   They would help her resume, then give her a ""mock"" interview  to help her out.  Let's just say , the job paid much better,  and it was hers.  This was part of what I was working on that I never got to tell her was set up.  She would have started today on January 3rd.  
  I work for great people,  so while it's a fast paced job due to ""just in time "" production.   So the job especially since its a larger corporation really a diamond in the rough.   Not to mention,  you literally decide your hours based on your responsibilities.   Making things like doctor visits easy.  With full benefits from day one. 
  This was huge since when support for my kids kicked in,  I wanted us to be able to support ourselves without having to scrape by.  Also, allowing us to do things for her kids and mine.

  Anxiety. 
  When we started school,  she had major anxiety issues with being in a small room with a bunch of people.  So, I had to work hard to make her focus on me, and not the room.   My issue is the same yet different,  as I have trouble with moving masses.  Like the mall is overwhelming to me with tons of people going all different directions.   She was the only one who ever helped through things like this.  Keeping me focused on her.  
  My other issues are more like just missing her.  In ten years,  we hadn't ever been not around each other for a full week.   She was my .....Center.  when she was around,  my back pain stopped,  and I could relax.  She was amazing. 
  
  The move out
  The night she moved out was a messy night.   The wife had been pushing her to find someone else.   So, she started talking with a guy several states away.   K was very...inebriated.   My daughter  admittedly rudely, read some stuff over her shoulder.   
 She yelled at her and went downstairs.   I was told something was up.  When I asked, all she yelled out the door was for her kids to get in the car.   So, I busted the door open to stop this.  I was not going to let her drive, especially with the kids in the car while wasted.   I argued with her to call her mom.   When I went to stop her, she went off (I don't blame her, the wife made the situation unbearable) and started hitting me.   So, I grabbed her and held her through biting me enough to leave a mark for years.   I let her up when she agreed to call for a ride.   I was probably wrong here, but, I was worried about people I loves safety. 
  Her memory of the night is completely different,  as I held her against her will.  She just wanted to wait in the car for her mom whom she said she had already texted.   She didn't tell me at the time, nor did her mom when I called her.  But, I guess I was wrong?
  This was the only physical encounter.   To be honest,  I was amazed at myself.   I think I would have lost it with anyone else in this world.  This by the way,  made me realize how much I love her.
  
    The ex

  I don't know why, but I would get jealous when she would talk to her ex.   He's half a world away.  So I get I'm being dumb.   But, it was still painful to me.   She didn't understand why, I couldn't explain,  so it was a running issue.  While he was not husband material,  she did want to be friends with him.  Have to admit,  I can't be all wrong here, since she found it so easy to get rid of me.

  No one will probably read this much.   But, I want to get everything out there.  Again,  there is more, but, I'm having trouble typing this because my anxiety has me shaking.   I wish I could erase her from my memory.   I just don't know how.   
  
  The bubble.
   She has a personal bubble that she lets very few people in to.  I get this as I have it too.  If you see her in general, she would prefer you just pretend she didn't exist.    I also usually feel the same here.  Our bubbles,  oddly seemed attracted to each other.   We could both deal with someone when we were together.   Split us up, and it was right back to square one. 

  The breakdown 
  At one point,  I had reached my breaking point.   Now,  I'm used to back pain from anxiety.   It's become part of my life.   There however was a time I just completely snapped.   I don't remember much but crying.   Expect that at one point,  and Angel showed up and took me in her arms.  The pain stopped.   Problems stopped.  The world was a new place.   When I realized it was k,  I knew at that moment,  all movies and stuff aside,  she was the one.  The you wait a lifetime for.   The one who is that other half of everything wrong with you. 
  She also had a moment like this,  and wrote me a letter expressing fate, and that I was hers forever.   I agreed and she had me promise to stick by this.  I did, and I will say I have never broke a promise to her.
  
  Now for tryingto email her, she has labeled me a stalker.   While I would never invade her personal space without invitation.   So crazy, she went from ""I love you"" to ""I'm blocking you ""   no explanation.   No quarter given.  I'm just supposed to walk away.  Like nothing mattered.   Like naming my daughter after her, always being that and dropping everything for her didn't matter.   I question.   What's the point of trying anything anymore.

"EDIT: I think I'm already more stable than before. I can't thank you enough for how supported I've felt reading the comments you people have posted here. 

Im 17. I'm posting this on am account I've just created because if I get through this, I won't want other people to know I've written the post.

I've spent this evening preparing the place where I would hang myself. It's a storage room, at the top of our building. I've made a mess in order to leave space around the hanger in which I used to hang my bike because it's the only place where I think I can accomplish my purpose of ending my life. I've cried whole oceans of tears while doing, however, I was willing to do it. I swear I was, I was extremely afraid of what I would feel while hanging, but then I thought again about my life and came to the conclusion that it was worth it. However, I went down to my house in order to go to the toilet, eat, etc. (maybe those were just excuses set by the survival instinct?), saw my mother and cried again. I ended up having dinner with my family, doing some house chores and I can't hold my tears anymore (Actually, I've had to go out a few times so they didn't notice). I might be alive tomorrow night or might not; if I am (because I'm unable to hang myself), they will discover my hanging set-up because we will be putting away the Christmas stuff in the storage room. 

(sorry, now I can't think clearly, I can't share with you everything I'd like to, so I'll jump to the end right now)

What would happen if I told my mother? I know it might be the help I need to continue living but life we'll never be the same. I hope she doesn't freak out in the moment, but even if she wasn't, I don't want her to be worrying about whether I would try to commit suicide again, searching on the internet  ""how to help my teenager suicidal son"", if I would try to hurt myself with a new knife that she has bought or , if I would jump off a high building when I get the chance. Also, there might be some times in my life in which a psychological test is needed to access a new job or opportunity. What if due to my mother they find out that I've been/am suicidal? What if they tell my grandparents or someone in the family and they spread the word unintentionally?

I've never told anyone about my feelings, both ending my life and seeking help iin my parents induce me too much fear.

"Is it? Successful people are usually strong physically and mentally, and I am neither.",5
I've had panic attacks before and tried to talk to my mom about it but she just blew it off by telling to watch videos about breathing exercises or some bullshit. Ive had depression for a while but recently it's gotten a lot worse. I talk to my friend about it but he just keeps pushing me to get more friends and thinks that will fix and change everything. I can't go to anyone about anything. So what's the point of seeking help if no one cares. What's the point of living if no one cares?,3

"So. This NYE i am at my neubghors who are just partying with friend and i am herebwith them. I am now drank 2 shots of Rum and thinking what have i done this year. I havent done anything, got phew new people what i know(i cant call them friends, never) 

My family isnt home, mom and dad are in diffirent country. I am here alone with my brother and grandmother. 

Soon..after 28 days are my birtyday. I am Aquarius. The silent sign. The intelectual sign..i am not smart..thats the problem, i am failing couple of classes in school. But i am socialy smart, i know which person is lying, i dislike people who overestimate themselves. So i lack self esteem basicaly.


I hope i can throw a patty for myself and see who truly deserves to be my friend. But there is 3 persons who i will 100% invite. My brother, my friend(he invited me to he's party and there i met a girl, who now is kinda my crush, and sure as hell ill invite her. I hope i get my money to throw it. Or ill make fun of myself. My mom doesnt realy care about me and i dont expect to get any money from her and now i have 0 euro and 0 cents. So i guess no party. Unless i get some money from grandmom, father(who i havent seen for a while, my mom and father are seperated) and mom. 

I'll have:

1.good birthday with small party or 

2.no party but it doesnt mean i wont have fun with myself and brother in home. Ill possibly buy bunch bottles with vodka and just drink. 

Btw i am lonely all of the time. It may sound wierd and it fucking sounds wierd. I imagine myself sometimes killing myself and imagining friend reactions. It's fuckrd up i know but that is what i do before sleep. Every night.

"I have a void in my heart. It's cold, deep, and empty. I've tried everything to fill that void and there's nothing left.

Just when I think I'm making progress something happens. Someone I know and love dies. I lose a job. I never have the money to do something. Someone cheats. It's always something. I want to give up. What's the use in fighting. I tell people I'm âgoodâ or âokayâ and they don't notice. Sometimes I wish people weren't so oblivious and can see my torment and help me. I'm lonely. I'm scared. Each day the nagging thought to just end it gets louder and louder. No matter how many bottles of Seagram's Extra Dry Gin I drink I can't drown it out. I'm lost, torn, and empty. I need help.",3
"I've recently been going to the doctor for problems with sleeping. I have bouts of insomnia, wake up feeling like I've barely slept regardless of if I've had a decent amount of sleep and feel tired through the day. I did all the tests my doctor could possibly think of and I'm perfectly healthy. When we first started my doctor asked if I felt depressed and I dismissed it because I feel the same as always. 

Now I'm starting to wonder if it's mental rather than physical. It's been like this for a long time, sometimes better, sometimes worse. 

I looked back through a few logs I kept of how I felt when I was so tired I could barely get up to go to work, and I would often write things about feeling disconnected. I haven't thought about it for awhile, but it's still there. It's not strong or oppressive or anything like that, just sort of a general sense of being in a dream, things flow past me and nothing really matters. People stop mattering, I stop caring about stuff I love, that kind of thing. 

So I'm starting to think that maybe I am depressed, but I have a habit of self diagnosing and scaring myself. I didn't really think about it before, since I don't feel 'sad'. But it all sounds like, at the very least, there's something mental going on that's making everything messy. Maybe it's just stress? I don't know.

I think I might look into it more, talk to my doctor about it, that sort of thing. Im at the point where I don't really care what it is that's wrong, I'm just sick of feeling this way and at the very least if I know what's going on then maybe i can do something about it. 

If anyone read this I could use an opinion (I won't take it as gospel but it'd help), some support or even just tell me where to go if this isn't the right place. I don't mind either way, I think it's good to just vent sometimes to think things through. 

Thank you. ",2
"A lot of the trouble I have is I've been down so bad for so long I don't even know what to do with myself and I start ruminating and feeling shitty. I can't keep myself frantically busy all day obviously, but the moment I stop my brain takes off into bad territory and digs up bad stuff.

"I'm still young. I can get along alright enough with people. I'm average looking. But I have no friends. I have people that I hang out with, have fun with, but nobody that I really connect with. I don't have that person that you can lean on, that you could trust with secrets, that you could just sit and be fine. 

I don't know what I'm going to do either. Any time I try to imagine the future, I'm just met with this crushing weight and I just wonder if it would be better to just kill myself instead of trying. 

And then their are my mistakes. All I can see when I look back at my life are a series of mistakes. So many fucking mistakes. 

Does anyone else ever fantasize about just dissapearing and starting over? Or just cutting all ties and pretending to disappear so you can kill yourself? Or wish that you could just be natural, just be your fucking self with anybody, literally anybody? Or just do anything right. Just to have a purpose. A fucking purpose. Life just seems so meaningless. Like what the fuck is the point. I just can't seem to find anything that makes life worth living. I have hobbies and things that I can enjoy but their just distractions. They just help me from sitting and thinking and wallowing in self pity. 

Why can't I just not care",5
This year I did a subject I was really passionate about but I just cant enjoy it as I feel everything I produce is worthless and honestly I just dont have the energy to do it most of the time.

"Not in a literal context but I really do feel like I'm regaining my life from someone else's control after a decade of numbing myself from meaningful social interaction.  I never talked to others, I've never flirted with a woman, I don't know how to read people, and I gave everyone the idea that I want to be left alone.  Now the real me wants to shine but I don't know how to do it and no one wants to give me a second chance.  It's as if I was spreading a rumor about myself.

"I just have no enjoyment in life anymore. I got out of a 6 year relationship about 2 months ago where I was cheated on. My confidence is rock bottom. I don't like the way I look. I have neglected my friends so I feel very alone. I am about to finish uni and I don't know what I want with my life now that the plans I made with my ex have all fallen through. I know that others value me but I don't value myself. 

I keep thinking about my last relationship and about everything I lost. I still can't understand how my ex could have cheated. It was so out of character and we had both agreed on numerous occasions that cheating was the most despicable thing you could do to a person. I want someone to fill the gap in my life which is loving someone and being loved but I have no idea if that will ever happen again which just adds to the feeling of hopelessness. Now I'm finishing uni I don't even know where I'd even meet someone new.

I tell myself that I am not depressed because I can snap myself out of the sinking feeling and sickness in the pit of my stomach but the fact that I keep returning to this feeling is starting to worry me. I want to say I can over-ride how I am feeling and logic my way out of it. I know that the way I am feeling is chemicals in my brain and how it's irrational and all the rest of it but understanding why I feel shit doesn't stop me feeling shit. 

I am making a conscious effort to speak to new people, to do new things and not to wallow in self pity but right now there are so few things to be excited or happy about and I am grasping at every little thing. Fake it till you make it though I guess.

"I moved to Toronto for school and no one came with me . Not one of my friends, or even other people I know went to Toronto for school. The only time I talk with my friends is when we play video games, and none of them show even any remote amount of interest in my life outside that. These are people I've known since elementary school.

I had another group of friends I thought I was getting closer with, we were supposed to go to a New Years party together. They ditched me, I'm not sure why, or what happened. I think it might have been accidental, but none of them cared enough to try and fix it.

Also just found out the first group of friends had a New Years party. I didn't get invited, even though I'm back in town for the holidays. 

And that's it. That's all my friends. Everyone I'm even remotely close with. That's it. 

I've been struggling with this loneliness ever since I moved, and this is kind of the cherry on top of the pile of dog shit, spending New Years playing overwatch with strangers and having emotional breakdowns at 4am. Goodnight.

"Hi all. Hope you are doing well. 

Just want to start off by saying thank you for hanging in there and sticking through tough times.

I come to you today for advice. (Thanks in advance for reading this)

Does the mind rule the body or does the body rule the mind ?..

.I'm in a really strange place right now. I know I have depression (at least I believe I do with my family history). But I usually find myself getting depressed about things I see in the world. 

For example just seeing how much sex is exploited. Just seeing the thumbnails of YouTube videos of women showing off their breasts and how these videos have millions of views. It just bums me out.

Seeing hate and violence on tv. It really just gets to me. I start getting really upset when I see how shallow/ easily tempted/ lead people are. 

Is this normal? Is it the world doing this to me, or is it my mind? 

I've basically lost everything these past few weeks..my belief in a god, my friends, my hopes. I now have only one real person I can talk to. I want out. And I've had enough, where is there for a person like me in the world to live ?

Please anyone, comment your thoughts on this. What gets you depressed ? Is it common what I feel?",5

"Exactly this day, one year ago, i was devastated from a broken relationship, i was also got laid off from my work. It was then that i decided to talk to one of my high school friend, and we continue to do that for until we became a couple. She is now my ex, she broke up with my, i'd spare you guys the detail but it's pretty much because of long distance relationship, my failure to realize it when she start to lose trust for me, and my stupidest decision ever. 2017 could have been my year, i found job at a place where the co-worker is friendly, and the boss treat me like family. I was in love someone who make me realize what it feel like to truly be in love, who can love me unconditionally. I could have it all, a good job, a wonderful family with her and my kid, yet I fucked it all up because i think too much, i worry too much about the future, about thing that may or may not happen, that i forgot about what important is in the present. I worked too hard for our future when i neglected her in the present, she began to lose trust in me, she was in pain because she think i abandoned her, and I didn't even realize it. Then she made a choice, she decided that she no longer love me and can't continue this relationship anymore. I can't get her to stay, nothing i said matter anymore, i was too blind to see that the girl i love the most was hurt be none other than me. After our broke up, i broke down mentally, i can't feel anything, can't do anything anymore. I was working two job and still in college, i tried my best to stay calm and collected when i'm study and at work. I barely pass the semester, got fired at my second job because i can't keep my mind clear, at least I still have my first job with me. Now, at the end of 2017, i was in that exact same place where i ended 2016, even worse than that. I just hope that i have the strength to go through 2018 without repeating any of that mistake, because i'm too tired of me ruining my life with my overthinking, i try so hard to control it, but i just keep doing that, and it results in me making stupid decision that keep ruining my life.",4

"I'm used to going in and out of depressive episodes. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was in my early teens. During some depressive episodes these thoughts are very frequent, more than 100 fantasies/day.
The thing I've realized is that these thoughts aren't just connected to my depressive episodes. Right now I'm not having an episode, but even a minor frustration makes me think about eventually killing myself.

I only told him something personal because he wanted to know more about me. So I opened up. But I also told him not to tell people about my family. I thought he was cool and we were friends for a couple weeks. I was new to making friends after deciding to open out of my shell. But now that this asshole tells people lies and rumors about me it just broke me. He tried texting me saying he didn't say anything but obviously I'm not that stupid. This seriously just broke me down. I hate people who use me for company. I just can't trust anyone or make friends. Now the school thinks I'm a crazy weirdo.

I have given so much to others thinking I would be given the same amount of love back, but that isn't the case. I just want one thing, someone to love because then I know I am not going to be alone for the rest of my life because right now all I think about everyday is the fact that I am alone in all of this.

"Yep. Women use me to boost their self esteem, and then they throw me away. Why am I alive? Why was I born to be a throw away?",5
"Hi everyone, I should've done a throw away account. 

I found this subreddit recently and I'm not sure where to start exactly. Not sure if this is even the right place. I just have this feeling of general loss, I'm 22 turning 23 in June. I live at home with my dad, I have no idea where my mom is, and that's fine. My parents went through a 8+ year divorce and I think it messed me up. I was 8 at the time, my mother was incredibly abusive to us. I still remember her choking my sister over the bathroom tub. It's something I don't think I'll ever forget. I spent those 8 years constantly moving from house to house apartment to apartment. I finally just stopped unpacking my things 

I was always described as the happy kid. Of course I was happy, I was fat as fuck. I had to smile or I probably would've killed myself in middle school, I certainly told myself enough times I was going to. Kids are fucking ruthless. I think it's fair to say I cried a lot up until high school. I lost that weight in high school, busted my ass and made something of myself. But now all I ever hear is how I'm not happy and that everyone misses the dacotah that was happy. I think they really just miss the dacotah that they could pick on without repercussions. I'm not sure how to feel about it all, if I'm not expressing a feeling of loss I just feel numb.

 I have problems expressing myself, or so I'm told. My college roommates used to call me emotionally detached. My girlfriend at the time thought so too, eventually they all just pushed me out of their life. I spent the 2nd half of the year alone in my dorm. 

I've never had the heart to call somebody out on their shit or get mad at somebody. I just end up mad at myself and wishing for that brief moment of misery to be over. My girlfriend, god bless her, has been supportive through these last couple months but she doesn't fully get it, and I don't know if I could ever explain it all. I love her to death and I hate the look on her face when I'm upset, nobody should ever have to worry about me.

In the 5 or 6 years since my sister ran away I have done nothing but watch my father fall into a pit of alcoholism. He's pushed everyone away from him and his problems only get thrown or deflected on me. He blames me for all of his misery, the divorce, the money. Which of course only opens opportunities for me to get confronted further. He would bitch me out and threaten to kick my ass, he'd pass out and I'd pick him up.  He'll apologize the next morning say he didn't mean it and do it again the next week. He actually did this again recently, he apologized but I've never wanted to be further from him. I'm not sure if he even remembers what all he has said. I haven't had the heart to tell him all the disgusting things he's said to me but it's really killing me knowing how he really feels. 

I know how to play instruments and I don't consider myself an idiot, I'm sure I have some smarts. I was always a busy person, writing for blogs, testing supplements for muscle tech, playing shows or just general choir engagements. I work for a cleaner service currently and I'm miserable. I thought working with things instead of people would help me. Instead I spend my time sweating my ass off while my 50 something coworker just supervises and judges everything I do.

Guys I'm just gonna stop for today

"For some of us, 2017 sucked. Relationships, friends (or lack of), grades, lost loved ones - whatever it may be, maybe this year was garbage. 

Personally (22/M), I just spent my fifth consecutive New Years alone - sitting here wondering why I'm still incapable of making any notable friendships at what some people consider to be the best/easiest age to socialize and make friends. 

Despite that, I'm convinced that sitting here listening to the fireworks alone isn't all that life has to offer - and maybe a change in attitude/habits will help me next year. By extension, I sincerely hope everyone reading this will have a better 2018 in whatever aspect of life is holding you down.

The problem is that I can't for one major reason. It would completely destroy my dad, and might kill him in the process too. My father and I have a special bond that you don't find with many people nowadays; we aren't just family, we are best friends. My father is the only person I can really speak my mind to, and he has said that I am his only true friend. My father has been through some dark places lately, too. It feels like the universe won't let him keep anything good for too long. He's lost about 5 jobs over the past month, through no fault of his own.

I won't go into any more detail about him as I'm afraid he'll find this post by some luck, and the fact that I've been rambling. The point is that if I kill myself, that would just be one more layer on top of the shit sandwich he's had to slowly eat.

I had been thinking about things recently, namely about how bad my depression has gotten, and I decided I'm tired of feeling this way and I wanted to do something about it.

I went to my family and decided to tell them my plan to move out which they thought I definitely should not do that way I could finish college. While we were having the conversation I began to tear up and my stepmom (who is like a second mother to me) asked me why I was getting emotional about it. I didn't really know why I was but I decided that I couldn't really hide it anymore. I told my parents I was depressed and suicidal and they both began crying. This was a shock to me because I have always felt as if I was more of a drain on them than anything else. It was extra surprising because I had never seen my dad cry, over anything, and I truthfully thought my dad was ashamed to have me as a son. They began telling me how much they loved me, and my dad even told me that he was proud of the man I've become, and I found out that my stepmom struggles with depression as well, and has taken medication for it and says she feels a lot better because of it. We're going to plan a doctors appointment for me and see if medication can do something to help me, because I'm doing a really shitty job of managing it now. I just wanted to post this to really share the experience with you guys, because it has honestly changed my whole world. I had been going through life, day by day, feeling like I was a parasite, feeling unloved, feeling ashamed to be who I am, but now after talking to them I feel a lot better, I feel like I may be able to finally fight this. Please excuse any grammar or spelling errors, I'm writing this in tears, but if you're struggling with depression, and feel alone, and feel like medication isn't for you, maybe you should just open up to someone close to you about your depression. I can't say that your experience will be the same as mine, I don't know anyone else's situation, but what I can tell you is that opening up to them, and finally telling someone ""I am depressed"" made me feel a lot better.

"Depression it's a bitch.
Its like there is a constant voice in your head telling you that you are worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, a disappointment that you don't deserve happiness or to be alive but to only feel pain. It makes you feel like you are forever trapped in an abyss with no way of crawling out. Sometimes you can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it always drags you back deeper than you've gone before and the impossible cycle of escaping begins again. No matter how much you try to escape the darkness, your brain yearns for the dark thoughts to return because it happens so frequently that it becomes the comfort zone for it. 
You begin to doubt everything about yourself; telling yourself whatever you do isn't good enough and you should just stop trying or its worthless to just go on and might be better to just end it all. You feel like you are nothing and will be important to anyone ever and when you are gone everyone will be happier knowing the pathetic failure that they once knew will be gone forever and can no longer fuck up their lives. 
All the smiles on the outside is just a mask to cover how you really feel. You cut because you feel like you deserve the sharp stinging sensation as the blade cuts your arm open and the blood slowing oozing out. Afterwards you are left with scars as a constant reminder of the pain you cause others and how worthless you are. ",5
"*wave*

I'm unsure where to even begin..

It's almost 2017. I'm 22 years old. I wake up every morning and regret the first and last breath of every moment from then until sleep carries me away, back into a dream world where my problems don't exist..

I'm struggling with things.. My memories just feel like I'm looking at a glimpse of somebody elses past.. I can't even focus on time accurately anymore. Everything seems to blend into one at times to the point that it's hard to recall whether things happened one day or another.. 

I have no purpose, no meaning in life, outside of living for my family. That's the one saving grace, I'd be long gone if they weren't around. But.. the longer this goes on the more I question the futility of living this way.. Selfish springs to mind, I would rip through their lives and leave an unfillable hole if I ever managed to muster the courage and end it all.

On top of this mental nightmare, I have no friends, I hate my job, my boss is a textbook asshole, using his position to self promote his importance and bring everyone else down even further. I've managed to be trapped in a life where work is the only social activity I partake in.. I play video games occasionally, but always alone. Socially, I'm inert. I can't help but feel if I had more friends and some semblance of a social life, my problems would be alleviated slightly.. but I've tried to no avail. I struggle with making friends, more-so any good ones. I can only reminisce of the times before I pushed them all away it would seem.

I feel the longer I stay here the further I drift ever closer to the end.. Looking for a job to no avail, the added failure stacking more onto an already miserable existence.

Don't get me wrong, suicide clearly isn't the ideal situation. Even I understand that there are bound to be things in life I enjoy, love even, that I've never even experienced.. but one person can only take so much before they snap. Even if it's in the pursuit of happiness.

People outside of this debilitating illness don't understand. I'm not sure many of them ever will. If I was asked ""Do you want to die?"" It's an easy no. Well why then? Because I'm tired of the crying, I'm tired of spending days in bed forcing myself to eat to avoid ending up back in the hospital.. There are no words that accurately definitively say what I feel, none that would provide the insight so many need to understand this shit. I'm at a point sometimes where I want to end it just to illustrate how I actually feel.. So people will finally understand.. Actions speak louder than words after all.

Time will tell where I end up. As I write this, seeing my life outlined like this, I can't work out if I feel validated or like I've just sunk even further into the abyss..

I didn't anticipate writing so much, it wrote itself mostly..

Sorry if it bore any of you, I needed to speak and this is one of the few subreddits where I didn't think I would be judged.

"The notes that we exchanged during my last few days at that high school, as well as the hug that you gave to say goodbye and farewell stayed with me. I carried it in my wallet, travelling towards my senior years in high school to the end of college. 

Perhaps you were kind. Perhaps you were pitying me. Perhaps I misunderstood what you were trying to tell me. I can't speak or think for you. So when I wrote you a message telling you how I felt, you read it, and you never replied back, deleted me, dropped me; completely eradicating my existence a year after I left, I still held that note. Did you hold mine?

I would appreciate a response from you, even if it's this late in time. I just want to hear it from you. Why you spent time with me, and why you wrote me that letter. What was the use of being my ""friend""?

"So this girl and I have been talking a while and I slowly started liking her more, I have extreme emotions and the only one I learned to control was anger so my other ones go Willy nilly, I haven't been diagnosed because they don't know what to diagnose it as.

For most of most of my life, from a teen to 33, I've had bouts of utter sadness/despair where I feel like I'm not good enough or ever will be. 

But it was always in small doses and usually I could be cheered up fairly easily. What helped a lot was looking forward to watching sports, videogames, nice food and time with close friends. It helped, it always helped, but it was fleeting.

Today at 33, I'm married to a gorgeous and wonderful woman. She really is a beauty, and everyone assumes she's a  trophy wife, except for that fact she's an engineer and has a very popular blog.  We have a wonderful flat, envy of many of our friends. We've got adorable dogs.

Our social life is ok, not great (we've moved to a new city and lost touch gradually with old friends), but we're both sociable and usually never spend a week without a social activity with friends. 

I've got a decent career and make twice what someone my age usually gets. My wife and I together earn just over Â£150K/year before taxes.

We travel a lot, workout a lot, eat healthily, socialize, sleep fairly well (at least 7 hours most nights)..........but that crippling sadness still lingers in me.

I find myself sad and withdrawn a lot for no specific reason. 

It's especially bad when I come back to my home country for Christmas and I see everyone I used to be close to seeming so happy and content without a care about me.

Right now, I'm particularly down about how one of my friends has been toward me. I got him a one of kind (took some effort to find it too, had to get in contact with the band's tour manager) amazing item from his favorite band. We weren't able to meet before Christmas, but today I saw him and he opened the gift and showed little to know appreciation, barely looked at it and then was on his phone 90% of the time, barely asked anything about me or my life. Then left in a hurry saying one his friends wanted to catch a movie with him and he didn't wanna be late.

Now that's a specific reason to be sad, but I've been very down recently and maybe it is my self esteem that's low too, but seeing how not just him, but so many people that I thought were important to me, have just ignored me. It hurts.

I didn't mean to rant, it's just my lingering sadness is getting worse.

I'm afraid to tell my wife, she's had mental health issues and is finally getting better and I don't want to set her back or burden her.

My best friend, the one who opened up to me about her depression, is my confidant right now and she is helping tremendously. Just knowing she understands helps. 

Does anything really fix this though? i just want to feel carefree and not sad/worried/anxious all the time.",4
"Forgive me if my English has some errors. I'm from the Philippines and I'm going to try to explain this as clear as I can.

I have a friend/classmate who has a girlfriend, who we're gonna refer to as Jane. They are both helping each other out in their problems but Jane is also a victim of abuse and we're trying to go the right step in getting help and to keep her safe.

Jane is sexually and emotionally abused and her mother and stepfather do not care about her. Jane has been raped by her uncle during a reunion in her mother's province. They were supposed to go there again this New Year but she didn't come and came to my friend to talk about it to his parents (more on that later). Her mom wouldn't listen and disregards it and her uncle continues. Jane's also been getting thin these past few months. Her drunk cousin also raped her in a separate occasion. She also has a sister who's separated from her parents but makes up stories and once sued their mother and won. She's also not to be trusted and she also doesn't care about Jane and she is manipulative.

At the same time Jane also has an ex (lesbian/tomboy) who threatens to commit suicide if she doesn't stay with her. There were times when my friend got punched/slapped by her ex but my friend didn't fight back. Both of them and my friend are depressed and have thought about suicide but to calm things down Jane agreed to stay with her for a while. However her ex became too controlling and threathened to hurt my friend and she also made suicidal threats and is trying to break them up. Her ex also blackmailed him and hacked his Facebook and sent numerous messages but fortunately we got it back. Jane and her ex are both in the same school while me and my friend are in a different one.

My friend brought her to his parents and told them what she's been through and still going through. They had a talk about her family, her ex, and the abuse. They now provide her school allowance and sleep in her classmate's house and are planning to report them but it would need to take time and resources to demand them in court. But so far they are going to lay low and take some time for now. 

Does anyone have advice on what to do while in the process of going through this type of situation?",2
"All I hear all the time is that ""I'm lazy"" and that ""I don't care about my family"". I'm honestly not sure so I figured here would be a good place to post and try to possibly see what is going on with me at this current moment.

I've been struggling the past year with getting motivation to do anything. It has just slowly been getting worse and worse. It's to the point where I don't even want to get out of bed most days. Maybe I need an environment change or something? I have no idea.
I also find myself struggling to communicate with people and get peeved over the littlest of things. For example my parents are always telling me to clean but then they pile of bunch of things into my room or my sisters room to ""clean"" out the other rooms. All this does is make me frustrated because my mom later comes in saying my room is a mess and that I'm filthy even though I'm not even the one moving anything because I've been in bed all day.
No matter how much sleep I get I always feel tired and leads me to never want to do anything or have the energy rather to do anything. I do have insomnia and on school nights I would only get about 1-4 hours of sleep depending, but at the current moment on break I'm going to bed around 8am-noon and just sleeping until I absolutely have to get up. Even still I know I'm sleeping way too much but it to me feels like it's just because I don't sleep much during the school year.
During school I typically would only eat 1 meal a day, 2 on occasion, but now it's to the point of me not even wanting to eat full meals. It would be maybe half of a slice of pizza or a bowl of cereal and that would be it + 1 bottle of water for the whole day, then I go right back to sleeping or go on the computer and watch twitch streams.
I am in pain a lot. It's usually either one of my legs or I have headaches, but I'm used to having headaches almost everyday. I also don't like talking about how I feel so I tend to keep to myself, but as of recently I have kind of just been locking myself away in my room and staying on my bed.

I honestly have no idea if I truly could be depressed and should somehow convince my parents to set up an appointment for me or if I'm just lazy. Or if I should just go to the doctor on my own since I'll be 19 this month and could technically drive myself there. I just would have to get the bill sent to my parents so either way they'd find out. The only times I actually feel like doing anything is if I'm able to force myself out of my house. I don't know if it's something that I should actually get checked or if my parents are actually right and I'm just downright lazy. Also, sorry for any grammatical errors I don't feel like reading through it and fixing anything atm lol.

I'm still very sick from losing my job a day after Xmas as I mentioned in my last post I feel really pathetic and more jealous of my brother in law yes I got problems but I just want everything he has but now I don't have any no income idk what to do with my life now so have a happy mother fucking new year,2

"Two years and some change ago, I left the Marines to attend college and move my life forward. Even before separating, I had severe depression and anxiety issues that helped me make the decision to leave. Soon after I separated and began my coursework, my depression exploded to the point where I couldn't do anything and my anxiety to the point where I was terrified of leaving the house. I want from straight As in one semester to Cs the next because I could never make myself go to class, either because ""it wasn't worth it, I'm going to fail anyway because I'm awful"" or because I was terrified of being around people.

I tried therapy. First, I want to a private practice where I was told that nothing is wrong, everyone who leaves the service faces this and gets over it eventually. She had no answer when I brought up the 22 movement, which infuriated me even more and showed me that I wasn't going to get help there.

Next I tried the VA, which only made it worse. After trying to get me to wait for months (it took the therapist (or what I thought was a therapist at the time) calling to get me in her currently empty schedule), I go through months of weekly visits that go along these lines: I walk in, she asks how my week was, I answer and give her my journals she has me write, she asks for any clarifications needed (what does this word mean? who is this?) and then sends me home to write for another week. Nothing changed, nothing helped, she was basically just a living journal I recited my life to. Once I found out that she wasn't actually a therapist but a temp holding the position until they got an actual therapist (she admitted she didn't actually have the ability within the VA to do more than prescribe me low-level medications, which incidentally didn't include anti-depressants), I stopped going. She had noted that she believed I had PTSD but due to her temp position could not diagnose me as such within the VA.

So I tried for a few months to handle things myself and spiraled downward even more. Moving towards divorce with my wife (I wanted it because I finally realized she is a large part of my depression), I tried the VA again now that they had an actual therapist in office. Got checked in to the psychiatric system (didn't happen last time), so got a whole therapist/nurse practitioner/psychiatrist team to help me. Went great until I left to visit family for a month, things got worse with my wife and I isolated myself in my house again. Where they had me once diagnosed with PTSD, and thus my care and medication was free, I was sent a letter informing me I owed the VA for all my medication since I was no longer service-connected (they went back and now denied that my service had anything to do with my mental state).

Adding to that, I panicked and dropped out of my courses for a semester and now owe $3000 to my university, effectively ending my courses and thus my GI bill benefits, which I was using for housing. With no money, I now had to get a job. That was August.

Since then, I've applied everywhere from McDonalds to senior IT positions as long as I met the qualifications. No part time work has come through (only response has been Best Buy that told me four months later I was not getting the job), entry-level IT positions are worried that I am over-qualified and will leave when another company offers me a better position (every HR that has given me a reason for not hiring me has cited this) and higher positions won't hire me because I don't have my degree, even when it is listed as preferred in the job description.

The worst part was the holidays. Stuck alone with my soon to be ex wife and listening to what few friends I have left tell me how great their christmas was. I'm not about to have them stop, even though it just rubs in that I sat home alone over the holidays, because over the past year I've lost almost everyone I'd considered a close friend and I'm terrified of losing the two I have left.

I have no idea what to do. Two months and I'll be homeless. And that kills me because I have a dog that I don't think I can live without (the only creature left that I feel truly gives a damn about me) but I'm not willing to take her to the streets with me. No job, wife's job isn't enough to pay for everything... I'm at a loss and every day something new gets dumped on me.",5
"Today I finally got the strength to finally get help with my depression.  Still trying to figure out the logistics of when my first appointment will be with the doctor but I'm proud I am taking a step in the right direction.

I think my slide into depression the last 6 months is from the loss of my dad as well as some other personal issues (hated my job/fallout with some friends/bad breakup) but it took 6+ months after all that for me to finally realize I needed help. I was sleeping in, just watching tv/playing Xbox and avoiding my friends at times when I started to feel anxious.  I started becoming more and more of a recluse but at this point I'm done with this feeling.

I have gotten a new job and mentioned to my boss that I might need to show up an hour late on Fridays for my therapy.  She couldn't have been more understanding and supportive of it.  I was nervous as hell to tell her but glad I did (depression hasn't effected my work, in a weird way it's the one part of my life I have felt empowered/productive).

Sorry for this rambling but I am only posting this to hopefully encourage others to do the same.  I know everyone's depression is different you can get help.  I also know I have a ways to go and this is only a small baby step.

I have been lurking at this page lately and have been moved by the posts I've seen. I hope everyone here finds happiness soon, and I know that's not easy.  ",4
"I never leave my apartment unless I have to go to work an I typically work late at night so I don't have to talk too much to people, then after work I go grocery shopping at the Safeway, go home, repeat. But today I woke up, ate food, and spent 5 hours 'getting ready' and now I am outside and fresh air feels great. ",2
"I have friends who except too much of me. They can't accept I won't get a job or a have a house or wife or kids. They can't understand someone who'd choose to be poor and just love the company he has rather than possessions or a car and stuff. 

I'm fine the way am I. Why can't they just let me be me?",4
"I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a while just to see how other people deal with their depression in hopes that it could maybe help me but for the first time I feel a need to reach out to the community. 

I'm a 21 year old 5'6 asian male adopted into a white family living in the predominantly white New Hampshire, so I've always felt like a bit of an outsider. being adopted I've always felt more indebted to my parents than a real kind of love, so to tell them that I'm unhappy with my life seems like I would be a disappointment to them after all they've done for me. please don't be mistaken, I love them more than anyone else in the world but it's a conflicted and strange kind of love that's hard to describe and hard to understand even for me. 

Being in college I have friends who are mostly tall white guys who are either in relationships, or have sex with random girls fairly regularly. I have nothing against them, nor can I fault them for this however when I hear things like ""getting girls is easy"" or ""I can't believe you're never with a girl"" like it should be easy for me. I feel I'm a social guy, I go to parties, drink at the bars, and hang out with my friends every weekend, but at then end of the night I go home alone. It's not for a lack of trying, I try to dance with and talk to girls but being short and asian almost always leads to immediate disqualification in their eyes. I get a lot of ""I have a boyfriend"", ""you're not my type"", even ""I'm a lesbian"" i've heard it all. I'm constantly described as a nice guy, and I genuinely believe myself to be as such but the constant rejection night after night crushes me. It feels like I'm playing my life on extreme difficulty, and its constantly weighing on me.
(-as a side note I have dated a girl, and we did have sex a few times but it ended rather quickly and wasn't anything serious)

recently I got some real shit news, there was a problem with my transfer of major some 2 years ago. So I found out at the end of my second semester senior year that my transfer into the neuroscience program never went through and since then the required GPA has risen from a 3.0 to a 3.3. As a senior my current GPA sits at a 3.04 so it would be impossible for me to raise it to a 3.3 with the amount of credit hours I have left. As such my only option would be to settle for a psych degree, and I would have to take additional classes. I would not describe myself as a naturally smart person, so I have only survived as a neuroscience student through effort and hard work, something I have always forced myself to do. My entire life I have believed that if you work hard enough things will go your way, however now that I'm faced with this situation I have found out that all the hard work that I've put in for the past 8 years (since start of highschool) has been for nothing. I have all the required classes for a neuroscience degree but administration has told me theres nothing I can do so tough luck. So now the only thing that I have any real pride in has been taken from me and I don't know what to do. 

Depression has always been something that I've battled with for the reasons stated before, but it has never felt heavier or more destructive than it does now. one of the most memorable quotes that I have ever heard is ""Suicide doesn't make the pain go away, it just gives it to someone else"". This has always resonated with me, and has always kept those thoughts at bay, but lately they have become more and more real. I don't think I could ever do it purely based on how it would destroy my family but I'm wake up every day hating myself. 

Honestly thank you to anyone who listened, this is something I have never told anyone, but I needed to tell someone about this monster I'm fighting.

Is it normal to think about killing yourself a lot but being too scared to ever do it? Maybe I'm on the wrong forum I know but I guess I started out over here just feeling sad again.,5
"I talked to someone at the hospital a couple of years ago when i was on the edge of killing myself but i was to tired to meet up so i acted like i had gotten much better and so i did not have to visit anymore.

But after a break down this fall i have been convinced i need to try it again so i will.

I am depressed but i dont know why, no clue, i just dont like living at all, its just not for me, and it makes me sad. But thats it, how can that be cured?",4
"I wanna ask you because for some time now I've been trying to be less cynical and do stuff other people like but I just cannot understand why are they doing  all of this? I hate facebook , I hate memes ,I hate internet culture and it annoys me to see people embracing it and not even being able to make a normal conversation just talk about memes on the internet , stupid youtube videos and shows that they binge watch in a day and don't have any valueable opinion on it just saying that they liked it or not . Am I just a cynical cunt ?
PS: By the way I'm posting this qustion here because this stuff is quite a big reason of my lolieness and depression , you know I just can't find anybody to connect with and it's not like I automaticly cross the person off for liking this stuff , I'm trying to get to know them and it turns out that they're just a frankenstein of all the popculture they absorbed and they cannot hold a conversation even for a little while.",4

No need to bash me, internet). But then it gets worse. She says feels like a ""piece of shit"". That she's worthless and stuff. I didn't know she felt like that because apparently, she was afraid that I would think she was crazy. Any help please? ",4

It was ridiculous that I sit here with a gun in hand, desperate and looking for a reason not to shoot myself. I was hoping for someone to talk to, but when I get stuck in a queue and start thinking more about what I'm doing, it did actually help me. So, once again I help myself. For this moment, I haven't actually pulled a trigger, but I still think about it every single day. I would like someone to talk about that to, but as it is, I'll take a brief internet vent.

"I need to get a job if I want to go to college. I can't really say I'm looking forward to it, or to the future in general, but the sheer pressure from my mom to get a job and her absolute misunderstanding of how work makes me feel is getting unbearable.

She means well. She loves me; I love her. But she cannot grasp this thing. I know she has mild anxiety, but I don't think this feeling of intense social anxiety is something she can understand. Working makes me absolutely fucking *miserable*. I've been in therapy for the past few months, but I can't say it's been doing much. I was feeling lighter overall recently until I realized that I had to get a job if I wanted to live up to my parents' expectations, go to college, and not be a pathetic fuck-up. So I want medication. I need it. I don't fucking care about the side effects, about how I ""need to take them alongside CBT."" Whatever. I want this feeling to go away, or at least to lessen. 

I can't FUCKING live like this. I'm going to mention it to my mom and my therapist as soon as possible. Whatever numbs the fucking pain, I'll take it.",2
"So I'm pretty much just gliding through the days now. I mean, the entire day just passes by and I have no sense or awareness of the time. It seems like before I know it it's 5am and time to repeat it over and over again. This has gone on for the past 7 months and has gotten progressively worse over time. 

I'm not really sure what to do. My financial situation calls for me to stay at home with my two young kids while my fiancÃ© works so most days I'm just trapped in here staring at the same four walls. My fiancÃ© doesn't understand me when I tell him that everything seems dull and grey. I know I sound like a whiny, sad sack of shit but I feel like I'm legitimately on the verge of a mental breakdown. 

Is there anyone else in here who's gone through this who is also a parent? Or just anyone who's gone through this at all? It feels like I've lost my identity. I keep trying to remember things that I liked to do before I became a parent but I come up blank. I've even lost the ability to have normal social interactions. Like, I used to be very outgoing and pretty talkative but now it seems like when I'm at a social gathering I can't find anything to talk about for the life of me. Then I end up just coming across really weird and desperate and socially awkward. I'm tired of everyone telling me âthat's the mom life and you just have to suck it upâ. It doesn't feel like every other mom or parent is feeling this way. I feel like I'm drowning.

Tl;dr- I'm a parent on the verge of a mental breakdown and I don't know how to pull myself out of it

"Hi, I am a 19 year old man, so I am still a teenager who probably understands very little about life. Even so, lately I have felt terribly depressed for the reasons I will make known a little later. Before, I used to be a very happy person, I had a girlfriend with whom we were about to be 3 years together. She was also my best friend, we did everything together and she did not need anyone else (besides, i did not have anyone else, but that did not matter to me, while she stands with me, i didn't need any friends). The thing is that at one point we broke, at first I was very affectionate, but I ""got over it"" quickly and I felt pretty good. The problems came when I realized that I did not know how to relate to almost anyone, I did not know who to turn to constantly as a friend, not as an acquaintance whom I only see at some parties. At first I did not take much importance, because despite not having friends, I used to go out at night quite often with different people. I went from group to group, everything was super intermittent, I did not stay with anyone constantly because I was not sure how to do it. Then, I reached a point where I started to get depressed slightly from time to time, like when I was alone in my house or went out to do everyday tasks, the fact of being alone and realizing it depressed me . Although I felt bad, it was not something that happened to me often (About 3 days a week more or less), but with time it became constant, I began to despair because I did not have anyone by my side. I tryed to make friends , but they all went away in the passing of days. So, I also began to feel as if people hated me, as if nobody wanted me and preferred to get away from me, as if I were a bloodthirsty. At this moment I do not know what to do, I have many suicidal thoughts, I do not want to get up in the mornings, I do not even go out, I stay in my house locked up doing nothing. The thing is that I do not know how to make friends, and that's killing me, loneliness is getting worse. I've really tried a lot of ways to make friends, but they all end up leaving me and that only makes things worse as I said before. I want to ask for your help, I want to know how you can make friends (Because i really have no idea how to), how to avoid this loneliness, how I want to go out and stop thinking about committing suicide, but most importatly, how to make friends, i feel like that's all i need. Thanks to those who came here, I appreciate your time and interest.

"I know for me I came to realize by my late teenage years that I have developed dual brain consciousness. What I mean is I alternate between two states at any given moment. Around friends and family I ""turn on"" my visual hemispheres. I actively look to be creative and funny and this drains my energy. When I'm alone I turn off and operate entirely on unconscious awareness. I will stare at the wall and ""recharge"" No thoughts, no feelings, like a dead man. People who caught me in the ""off mode"" have told me I  have dead eyes. 
   
All of this translates to my sex life (non existent right now) But when it was active I was never able to cum inside a woman. The reason being sex is a spontaneous act. And i operate like a robot in the off or on mode. I simply can't let go like other people. 

This is what causes my depression. Could be autism, adhd, or any other host of illnesses. Bottom line is after 25 years I realize you can't change it hard as you try. The neural pathways planted their roots long ago. This causes me pain because all I ever want is to socialize and keep appearances like normal people ",4
"Something that has begun recently in the last 2 years is my overwhelming depression. I have a friend who lets just call Tyler. Its not his real name. A girlfriend called.... Maria? Sounds good. And a best friend lets call Shana. For the longest time I never had a depressed state, even when I was in high school. I always seemed to just be doing fine and that's mostly because I was good at something. Video games have been my life, they used to become my cherished center where I could always go to escape life for a few good hours and come back refreshed. Where I had so much fun seeing developers make these stunning worlds and querky characters. It gave me the best years of my life, now its become a hellscape of depression and sorrow. 

Not all games, Undertale was a big helper in my dark times. Yet to this day most games give me this bitter feeling. So the reason why is im not good at anything, nothing at all. In real life I have no talent. In my job im seen as the weakest link (in all 7 which i got fired from my last recently) because I am physically weak. I have an issue where I am unable to remember simple things but can remember the most complex passwords. I can't even remember my own name some days and I actually stand there thinking about it. I have no money and nor do I care but I was made fun of it alot. So video games was my big deal right? Unfortunately as of late my friends became so engrossingly good at it i can't deal with it.

My girlfriend can beat me at everything. Were having fun and I think its going to be a good time so we play Battleblock Theater for example. She always gets to the end on every single level, and gets most if not all the gems first. She uses these weird tricks and the thing is she has no previous experience before.....but she always wins. So much so she apologizes for it and rubs it in by saying shell let me go ahead..... like im a stupid child. Tyler on the other hand beats me at everything as well and makes it worse. Say a game like God Eater. I practice against a monster maybe 30 to 40 times. I even spent an entire day trying to master this fight against 1 creature. So game comes down and were playing with another friend but I die not once but 6 times. Hes laughing at me saying its easy and im a loser for dieing. He laughed even more pointing out he got an SSS rank (the highest) while i got a B..... cause i died entirely. I also play games like Overwatch and Killing Floor and even on those games he gets golds across the board and recently after losing on God Eater he flat out said ""Why do we even have you here?"" refering to our new friend getting the game, so he kicked me out and just now as I type they are all beating the final boss of the game with the new guy proving hes completely surpassed me....he uses my same weapon and all and called me ""Useless"" and saying ""I should kill myself"" .....i should, I truely believe failures like me should be euthanised. Make room for the great and the growing. If you have nothing at my age of 24 you should be removed from this earth and ground into fodder. im useless im garbage i hate myself i hate living and i hate freaking everything now, my life is just filled with failures and holding everyone back and im not good at a single thing no matter how hard i try or cry or sweat or work and nothing ever works out and even if i practice ghours after hours i alwys end up just being last dead last i want to win once i want someone to say i fucing matter at anything! WHY DO I TRY IF ALL I WILL DO IS LOSE EVERY TIME AND HAVE EVERYONE HATE ME BECAUSE IM A LOSER WHY CANT I JUST DIE AND BE DONE WITH IT!?",4
"**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**

I am so confused guys. So, basically my story  began 5 months ago, It was triggered by reading the news about Chester's bennington suicide. I am 20 years old male, with a previous history of OCD(Fear of getting a heroin addict.), but I can't tell if it is the same or worse. It is horrific. Here is what happens. After I read the news, in my head went something like 'If he can do it, then why shouldn't I?' And I started having intrusive suicidal thoughts, I will give an example:

-A friend: Lets go and drink a coffe tomorrow.

-Me: Okay

-My mind: If I don't suicide by then.

So basically at the begining (the first few hours) It was terrifying, but I was unaware what is going to happen after this.

So I got pretty paniced and googled: 'intrusive suicidal thoughts' and major depessive disorder or OCD showed up. I entered both web pages and both said '10 times higher chance of commiting suicide.'

This was the moment when everything fell appart.

This was the moment when I felt this rapid change in my mind.

This was the moment in which I felt like a part of me changed into something horrific.(Okay this was too much movie like sentence, but anyway.)

So basically my life is pretty rough since then I will try to be as accurate as possible, I have days in which I feel relatively normal. So, here are the things happening in my head and body. Some of them are constant, some of them are not.

Intrusive suicidal thoughts which feel real. I really hope they are intrusive, and not true Suicide Ideation. With a confusion If I want them or not. Which is terrifying.

Knot in the stomach.

Whenever I look online for something to buy, there is a feeling like 'There is no point I won't be here soon' and a knot in the stomach.

Feeling like I can't do anything fun, like can't relax I don't know how to describe it.

Less interest in people.

Less apetite.

Sudden feeling of tiredness sometimes.

Nearly constant, uneasiness.

Scary feeling, when I imagine my life without these thoughts, it feels like kind of boring?! I don't know it this is the right word.

Feeling on the edge, feeling like my life is shortened, like I will do something bad soon.

Random feeling of life being pointless without a reason with a variating duration.

Random TERRIFYING Intese feeling like trapped in life.

Random feeling that I need to escape, but there is no place to.

When I am feeling bad, there are constant thoughts, random things I have read on google reddit, with a pictures of the article I was reading.

I stopped working, and now I feel like If I work or feel overwhelmed I will do it.

I stopped University becausw of it, and because I didn't find it interesting.(I made a mistake with chosing my subject.

Intrusive unsettling feeling real scenarious in which my best friend tell me If I want to work with him.(We had a pretty sucessful store.

Feeling like I don't want to admit that I am suicidal?!

Feeling like I don't want to get better?!? I tried finding a reason, but I can't think a reason why, like I stop thinking when I try.

Fear that I developed these thoughts, a few days before Chester's thing, and I try to see my chats to see if there are some signs, but it is impossible to be sure.(This is not a big deal, but I am trying to be as accurate as possible.)

At first I thought this is depression, however I don't show many signs of depression. Then I thought it is Anxiety, but It feels darker and realer than Anxiety.

Weird negative feeling when babies arround.

Random feeling like everything I see is too much?

Fear/Feeling like this is something unknown, incurable and it is impossible to feel like before.

**Now on new year everyone is wishing ""many years"" and it triggers anxiety everytime like i don't want it?!? Guys I am really sad over this what the fuck.**

Intense moments when I feel like I am losing control. (I will give you an example of what it looks and feels like.) It happened 2-3 times for the last 5 months.

And the most important and horrific:Â  Scary intense moment with like a physical urge ######6. As it follows: It is triggered randomly. This is what happens: life feels meaningless with a weird image stuck in the back of my head feeling, like future idk, feeling of unrasiness, unsettled feeling, negative scenarious, I try to calm myself with a positive thoughts, I succeed for like a second, then it feels like the negative thoughts, reinforce themselfs and become more and more intense, then I am like 'If i feel like i will do something i will go to the hospital, chill., then like 'it doesn't matter you feel trapped' and it becomes even more intense and more intense uneasiness feeling, i close my eyes laying in my bed, almost starting to feel normal for a couple of seconds, then i open my eyes and everything in my head is intense again, i try again to counter them, it becomes even more intense.

I have several questions:

What does it look like?

Does it look like actual suicide ideation/suicidality?

Do I sound suicidal? I am so confused

Thanks in advance.

"After being tossed aside by a few people now that I considered really close to me, it has me wondering if it's even worth meeting new people. Like damn, I spent 7, 8, 9 years getting to know these people just to get blown off in the end. I don't want to start over again telling people about myself, telling stories, explaining how I think, and all of those things you naturally do when you know someone for years. 
It's not even just loneliness, it's a feeling of dread knowing that you're going to have to go through the same things that you did with the people who have hurt you to try and feel like you mean something all over again. 
Don't really expect anyone to read this seriously, just felt like firing up the old depression account again. ",4
"So for the last year I've been suicidal and knew I needed to get help but couldn't afford it. I had an idea to ask my parents to use their health insurance since in still on it to get me to see someone, but was terrified to tell my mom her little boy was so broken. Well tonight I did it and cannot believe how understanding she was. Turns out depression runs in the family and she's been secretly seeing someone for years! 

For all those struggling - it's okay to ask for help. You deserve to be happy and if that means opening up about your struggles to loved ones, all the power to you!  I love you guys!",3
"I graduated from a good US with a masters in mechanical engineering. I watch a lot of my peers who cheated their way through grad school get jobs and a decent salary. I have been struggling to find a job since I graduated in May 2017. I am an international student and have not seen my family in three years. 

Today is my birthday, I am alone with no one at home, because all my friends can afford to go for trips. I got three birthday wishes, My parents and a close friend. 

I do think about suicide, but i am not going to do it, I have worked too hard to throw it all away. I am a good hardworking guy who means well. Sometimes, when i see my peers who cheated on tests work for companies like Amazon, I wonder to myself, if I should also get a chance at happiness. I have been so lonely and depressed that I honestly forgot how it feels to be happy! 

anyways thank you for reading and listening to my rant, Happy New Year!",2
"Hey guys,

I'm lost. Quick introduction. I've had four heart attacks due to bad genetics and i'm only 25, and i need to know what i need to do next. I'm so miserable, I have fallen into deep dark severe depression of emotionless days that plagued me since 22. What would you do? 

I am sitting here drunk as all else, and every year has become a tipping point of despair. ",3
"My mum came to my room and asked how I was doing. 
I have depression but I never told her because I don't want her to feel it was her fault or that she made me feel like a complete failure. 
She came and when I told her nothing she got up and started crying. 
I felt so heartbroken I can't believe I made my mum cry, I asked her why she was crying and she told me because I never talk to her anymore I never hang out with her anymore and I've completely changed. 

I couldn't do anything but tell her not to cry and that I'll try my best to make our bond stronger like it used to.
Before I was hit with depression we used to do things and have laughs 
But now I ignore her and just stay in my room all day. I hate this because I love her so much but idk what's wrong with me. 

I hate myself for this I need help on how to make things work out with her. I'm a disappointment of a child.",4
"All I can do is feel these negative emotions, but I can't express them. I don't know how. It's usually a skill that people are just born with or learn at an early age, but I didn't thanks to all the stupid things wrong with me. All I need is a long cry and I can't even do that",2

"I was sexually abused as a child, there I said it. I hate bringing it up, it's a mood killer and it's not hard to see why. The problem is, well, there are many problems. Let's just go through some of them: Extreme anxiety and depression, self doubt, little to no self confidence, the feeling that I am malingering when I am not (idk how to explain it), feeling constantly alone, forcing myself into positions where I am alone. You get the idea.

I also have terrible coping mechanisms, I mostly play video games to pass the time, I am smart as my mother constantly reminds me, but all I see are my failures. I only find happiness from other people, I am always angry and sad, and this paragraph is a mess and now I'm crying.

"I want to tell someone, ""HEY LOOK WHAT I'M DOING!"" but I don't have anyone here, so I'd like to tell y'all â¡

It's a sunny day, but cold. I'm going to go for a walk and look for some geocaches. It was hard to figure out what to do today, because I didn't want to do the activities that I was going to do with other people before they flaked on me. 

Going for a walk holds no appeal, but it seems healthier than sitting in my room being anxious.  So, go me! I'm gonna go put my warm clothes on now. I'll update y'all with my resolution progress if that isn't too annoying.

"Started this new med after failures with Lexapro and Cymbalta. After my primary talked about starting me on this new Med I got concerned and turned to the community for testimonies and different peoples experiences. After cycling off Cymbalta which was hell by the way I've been on trintellix 5mg for 3 days now the side effects are unreal. Nauseous 5 minutes after taking medication until I go to bed 14 hours later mood swings are off the charts I've been more depressed than I have been in the past 6 months and to add to it I am now light-headed and dizzy constantly. And don't get me wrong I understand when starting a new Med I am prone to nausea and mood swings and instability or whatever else you want to call it but I have never been nauseous for 2 days as a side effect and I've never had mood swings comparable to this. My head is always killing me which again common side effect of antidepressants ssris you name it but this is weird. It seems like a disconnect between my brain my head and my body.. I don't know how to explain it other than foggy Maybe.. I've also noticed when I get a spike in Adrenaline,  and then settle back down it seems to hit me all at once.  and coming down from adrenaline on this is not a gentle slope into calmville, its an abrupt atom bomb of whatever chemical it may be and it bottoms me out so far that I've nearly collapsed while working twice. I mostly just wondering if this is a potential side-effect that may go away after chemical levels balanced out or build up, but this is unnatural and I'm not going to be able to stay on this medication any longer if this continues. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar. who knows maybe I'm just all sorts of fucked up and need something closer to a lobotomy. Thanks in advance, ",3
"As I go into 2017, I feel nothing but sadness. I go explore Snapchat to see my friends that have started to drift away with their lovers, family, or a mixture of both his and her families. They're all laughing and having an amazing time together while I just sit here in my room.....alone.


This year has been nothing but negativity for me, not just because of all the negativity the media has been flaunting around in our faces about the horrible celebrity deaths, but because of my three deaths in my family. All of which I was extremely close to.

I feel like an outcast at my job and pretty much anywhere else I go but I act as normal as you could define anyone as ""normal"" would act. I try to treat anyone I come across with nothing but kindness and hate to see someone get mistreated.

But seriously, to continue with my sloppily organized post about how this negativity is ruining my life, I don't have my life even 1% figured out. I'm 21 which is a young age to have anything at all figured out but as I look around all I see are my friends getting engaged or getting these big job offers that they've always dreamed of. Some of them are also getting excepted into their dream schools to do what they've always dreamed of. One of my used to be closest friends got accepted into a school in Atlanta that will score him a place in TNA which will therefore most likely lead him into WWE. Yeah yeah it's fake and blah blah blah but it's what he wants to do and I've been supportive of him. I work at Lowe's, it's a very loving job and I love the people I work with most of the time, I don't feel like it's enough though. I don't feel like I living up to what I can be, but I don't know what I can/should be doing. Not a damn clue.

I've spent most of my last 6 months alone ever since my aunt died. I'm just very unsocial and it's extremely difficult for me to make new friends. I'm also not one to go and party (alcohol, weed, etc) because it's just not me. Everyone around me is that way and they're even getting into harder drugs. Yes this is the people I work with. My past relationships have both ended because of them cheating on me. I just don't really know what's wrong with me or if I push people away from me for a reason?

What I'm trying to say is that as I look at my friends having a blast on new years eve/day with their families, I sit here with tears in my eyes because I feel like I have no one. I feel very unloved and very unwanted. I just feel like that 2017 is going to be a long year spent as a loner because I just don't appeal to anyone and I don't have anyone to go out and do anything with to meet more people. I don't finwant to invite myself into peoples' plans and I don't want to invite them to do anything because rejection is pretty common for me. I trapped in a very dark place and finding the light seems impossible for me. Someone please help me. I haven't felt happy in a very long time.",2

"I found out accidentally last week that all of my friends are going to another one of my friend's party. I was not invited. My one friend who isn't going isn't responding to my texts. So now I'm alone at my house with Chinese food and beer. This past month I've felt more alone than I've ever have and i don't know how to deal with it. I'm starting to realize my place in friendships as the excess, the one who is forgotten or dismissed. This NYE was the icing to the cake. I'm hoping that 2017 will be better but it's not promising. Does this feeling of loneliness ever get better? Im scared that if I don't do something about it, it'll spiral out of control and that terrifies me",1
No one in my family knows. The days I wake up so late because it's impossible to wake up. All the student loan debt that is creeping on my back and I still haven't graduated yet.

"I spend every waking moment pondering my life purpose. I know I don't have one. I get up, go to work to afford to pay every bill. I get up, go to class so I can have a career, to pay every bill and buy mundane things which add value to my life. But what is the point? At the end of the day, none of this matters. For anyone. No one has a purpose. Some people may be richer than others and can experience more things, but who cares? We all die anyway. Everyone spends 80-95 years chasing dreams that don't matter, we're all just existing to exist. This makes it hard for me to care about anything. Nothing matters to me. I'm in my last year of college and will have an education degree I plan to do nothing with because the thought of teaching 30 individuals to become something in life sends my anxiety through the roof. I truly just want to die and not deal with the unnecessary stress of life but that would then ruin the lives of my loved ones around me. I'm stuck. I've been this way for about 3 year now. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel, and everyday I pray I'll die in a car accident or something so I won't have to kill myself. I didn't ask for any of this, I don't want to be alive. I might need antidepressants but who knows ",5
"Okay everyone hello there, recently I've been having extreme panic attacks and depression. It all started with me crying imagining what would happen to me if my parents died on public transport. My mum instantly comforted me and told me that wouldn't happen (I'm 13). I continued on to yesterday which as you all know is New year's. I started getting even more panicky thinking about what happens after life and that if I die is that it? I solved that by reading some theories on after life and forming my opinion that we go into a sort of lounge with the spirits who wait for us. After that I've lost all ambition to become an entrepreneur and just thinking of what point is there to life. I've been able to get myself out of the panicky state only when watching youtube or playing video games. Any other time I end up being highly stressed for some unknown reason.

_________________________________

I have been searching that particular person for years.

But apparently, I seem to be carrying a curse with me.

Every time I feel like I found someone *(and hopefully, not because I am desperate and because sometimes I want to say ""SOMEONE, NOTICE ME!"", and there were indeed times where I felt that she was ""the one"", so to speak)*, then all of a sudden ... **POOF** ... she is gone and out of my life

Could be because she found a spark with someone else.

Could be because that when I tell her who I really am, when I remove the mask to hide what I have to go through everyday, she slowly starts to become distant.

Could be because she was not who I thought she was

Apparently, I feel like I seem to be carrying a curse that whenever I feel like I finally have happiness, or finally have my own sense of peace and tranquility ... everytime that happens, I **KNOW** that it is too good to be true because after a while ... it just disappear and I am back to square one again.

*And this is not just about looking for a girlfriend only. I feel happy for a day and later, I am told that I failed a test or forgot to wash the dishes which later made me up fighting against my roommates. I thought that I found a friend, but later on, I found out that they only want to be with me when they are alone or when they REALLY need me. Or when I feel like I can handle my own emotions, all of a sudden, an accident happens*

It's almost as if fate itself wants to punish whenever I find that short period of happiness and tranquility. It always wants to find a way to take from me.

"Wow, now that's Not how to start 2018. I work an office-type of a job, which has a lot of communication to do with tourists. My job is tied with issuing a lot of invoices. But today, I made about $3,000.00 worth of financial damage to the company. What's even more sad is that me and my boss, which is a great guy btw, we don't really get well along, and today he welcomed me being very happy himself! It was a very happy moment. I'm a kind of an awkward guy when it comes to communication with my boss. My awkwardness comes from severe anxiety I've evolved from childhood, because everyone was treating me bad, even strangers. It makes me happy when my boss approaches me being happy. But today, I had a lot of important invoices to issue, and screwed each and every one of them. My boss was furious. He shouted at me a lot. Now I'm at a point where I think it's either better to kill myself, or ask him to fire me. My sole point is to not have him be angry. If he's happy, I'm happy. I know, this is really weird now that I'm thinking about it. It's the same way with family. Now I'm behind my desk, alone and hoping to be alone until the end of the workday to go home, and either beat myself to sleep, or cry the soul out of me.
Anyways, because it's New Year's, he decided to handle the problems and remain happy. I can't apologise, they are mistakes I cannot un-do. However, after the storm ended, I appear to still feel a crippling depression. At one point I was considering suicide as a proper way to deal with this situation. Hear me out, I don't have a lot in my life. Anytime I try to succeed a plan, I always fail. Only thing I have in my life is my family to care about. I'm the only man in the house, and I'm still very young. Nobody, but me, could take care of my family, and this makes it impossible to travel anywhere. I feel as if I'm critically handicapped towards achieving happiness. It kills me from the inside. Everyday I strive to make myself happy from little things. But they are temporary.",2

"Wall of text. Feel free to skip. I should say my psychiatrist did his fellowship at Johns Hopkins, the best medical school, and the ECT head went to Stanford and is certified in ect and connected to the (well-respected medical) university here (Tampa)

I have been diagnosed variously schizophrenia /schizoaffective /and even bipolar. I was in a psych ward and left for dead pretty much at 18, recovered completely after detox from a crazy psych cocktail, got B. A, M. A. even taught abroad. Had a very stressful illness in a minor city in China and whatever medicine given either caused or exacerbated some delusional thinking. But I recovered in a major Chinese city on what I assume was sedatives. When I got back to the US I couldn't sleep and eventually went on the antipsychotic paliperidone and klonopin after trying various medicines including trazodone and got a job teaching English as a second language at a university , but decided to go off the antipsychotic , which went poorly as heavy depression set in again sparked by illness followed by psychosis and hospitalization twice, both psychosis remitting after a few days. Stayed on the paliperidone. 

Flash forward to this fall. Eventually decided I'd had enough of the inhuman feeling of paliperidone, I became ridiculously depressed and was having issues with my body freezing in place and moving in genral. One medicine (memantine) I took made me suicidal to the extent that i was arrested and involuntarily held in a hospital that my neurologist had suggested I get ect in if Ativan didn't work. (he also diagnosed multifocal dystonia and catatonia, which the catatonia the psychiatrists didn't seem to agree with) 

I was lucky because psychotic depression set in mildly after a few days in the psych ward but no one noticed and the next day I had ect. Been through four sessions since. After the first, the suicidality and inability to move much and psychotic depression went away, and, eventually, after a few weeks, I began to feel a sense of happiness for the first time in at least ten years  

I've tried and has bad reactions to pretty much every atypical antipsychotic on the market, and been shot with Haldol at least 4 times. Also tried pristiq and wellbutrin with suicidal thoughts as side effects for the first one and clonus for the second, which I thought may have to do with serotonin syndrome

Currently taking klonopin 1mg 2x a day only. Psychiatrist thinks some people are not fit for antipsychotics as I always get all the side effects (Same with antidepressants)

Heavily recommended the deeply researched book ""Shock"" by Kitty Dukakis and research by CORE if you want to look into medical journals",3
"I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience, and how they handled it.
I an 32 years old and I have a mix of anxiety and depression, and often find I am really only feeling ""ok"" when I am at work of asleep, especially in the winter.  This winter I have been really lonely, having pushed away/ been pushed away by most of my friends (getting older is a bitch.  I used to be a popular guy, now I'm pretty isolated and lonely).
So, lately, I have been working pretty hard, and then when I get home I just want to put on the TV and go to bed, even at 5 or 6 PM.  Part of the problem is I will wake up after like 4-6 hours, even if I am still tired, even if it is just midnight.  The even bigger problem is that I have been having all these weird, self-injurious thoughts.  When I have them, I am really horrified and feel a tremendous amount of anxiety about it.  When I am falling asleep, I will *JOLT* awake, and this will happen over and over.  I also have weird thoughts that I might jump out of my window or do something self-injurious while I am asleep, which terrifies me.  I know this is all sort of irrational. Unlike some other people on here who contemplate suicide, I never do that.  It's more like an OCD fear that pops into my head that I might lose control impulsively, or something might happen while I'm asleep.  Sometimes I'm using scissors or a knife and I will have the same weird fear wash over me, and I literally have to put down whatever I am doing and walk away from it.  I don't trust myself.  Is that weird?
Recently, the thoughts are really escalating to a point where I am sometimes really unable to go to sleep for a long time.  Sometimes I will start drinking, just to sedate myself to chill out for bed.  Any idea what may be going on?  I'd be interested to hear if other people have had this experience of Sleep Jolts and Obsessive fears of self-injury?",5
"Yep. I lost motivation in pretty much everything. I don't bother going to the gym anymore, I don't bother flirting with girls cause I get rejected every single time, I don't bother reaching out to âfriendsâ cause none of them don't even care about me honestly, I go days without showering or brushing my teeth if I don't have any plans or going out of the house cause I just don't care anymore, I'm getting worse grades in school, and I'm rarely genuinely happy nowadays.  

I just don't care anymore. Nothing matters anymore. I just want to die already honestly. This world sucks. Life sucks. ",5
