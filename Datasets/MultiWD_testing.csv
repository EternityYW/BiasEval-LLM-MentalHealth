"I hate every single thing about myself and I don't know how to stop. My looks, my personality, my body, my voice, everything I do makes me hate myself a little more. If i didn't have a family that loved me and if I had the guts then I wouldn't stick around. It's too painful to be in this state of mind all the time. I'm ruining my relationship with the love of my life because I hate myself so much that I can't bear to be intimate with him. I truly am disgusted by myself. I avoid showering because I feel like crying every time I look in the mirror. I need to know how to stop hating myself. My therapist tells me I need to learn self-compassion but I feel like that's literally impossible. Sorry, just need to get it all out but I really am at a loss. At this point it honestly blows my mind that there are people that actually like themselves. What I wouldn't give to feel that way.",0,0,0,1,0,0

The problem is that my mom and I are both powerless because my dad has us under his money.

My dads family is wealthy and they're all a bunch of fucking elitists and my dads family protects him like he's an angel.

I'm having such a hard time dealing with lack of focus in my entire life. It makes me feel like garbage and a waste of space to grace this planet. I swear everyone around me has passions and potential and a drive to succeed in one area or another yet I have taken such a long time to come to terms with myself and its still not there! I'm surrounded by confidence and go getters and i know deep down that i could go and try and do all of these things that i want to experience but when push comes to shove i find it impossible to justify it or sometimes even remember what it was i wanted to do. This lack of passion for life gets me down every bloody day and I just want it to go away so that i can become comfortable with myself and have an casual epiphany that will allow me to move on a get on with my life.,0,0,0,0,1,0

Also, I'm the only gay person, which I know my very Catholic family won't like when my partner and I get married. I feel like that'll just make things worse and that they'll shun me from the family.

"Over the last year I have felt like my life was just getting worse and worse. I left my fiance in November of 2015, which is a long story but it boils down to I always felt like I was never enough in her eyes. I felt like she was emotionally abusive, so I left. For a time I seemed to be happy. I had just gotten out of the military (note this story has nothing to do with trauma from the military) and I moved back to my home town so I could finally see my friends and family regularly again. All seemed like it was going well. I got a job at the local hospital, I'm currently living with my sister so that's helping with money. I just feel like I'm a shell of the person I was before I met my Ex. I don't know how to be happy anymore and I don't even remember what it feels like to experience true elation for something. I use to love writing or reading, I can barely do both anymore. This is the most I've written, and meant it, in a long time.

I‚Äôm 23, male, fit and healthy, come from a good upper middle class family who support me well and I really have no hard struggles to deal with. Despite all this since about the age of 10 I‚Äôve wished I was never born and would rather be dead. Really the only thing keeping me from suicide is that I don‚Äôt want to put my family/ loved ones through that pain. This may be decent enough to keep me alive but still isn‚Äôt much of a viewpoint to live from, there are times I resent my family because I have to endure the pain and stress of life just because of them. I would just much rather be dead than go through the stress of living and working for the rest of my life, call it depression or laziness or whatever but it‚Äôs just my viewpoint in life and I can‚Äôt shake it. Does anyone out there have a similar mentality and have ever thought or been told anything to truly shift them out of that mindset? Therapy has never done anything to help me shift out of this and I almost feel like it‚Äôs too much of a therapist to be able to do so.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"I'm 18(M) and turning 19 in a month time. I've been having depression since late Jan 2016 which started because of an extremely bad break up, financial issues, parents divorcing thus having to move out as well as performing badly in class. i'll try to keep the post short and simple because I'm exhausted right now, typing this on mobile doesn't help too, especially for formatting. Any advice from those who have/had depression would be greatly appreciated. Well, just ranting for online does relief everything in which I had bottled up. So on new year, I just broke up with my girlfriend(4months) and connections from my close friends. My relationship was toxic as it felt as though I was the only one trying as I clinged onto the thoughts that she would be the one who help me to get out of depression. She was initially really supportive and that was why I was attracted to her, she helped me to elavate my abuse of tobacco but I feel as though I'll fall back into that sinkhole. People change and I don't blame her. She feels exhausted and does not feel the same way anymore. Right now I'm just really exhausted of everything. I have scheduled appointments for a psychiatrist that was done by the SAF, Singapore's Army basically. I don't know what to expect besides perhaps being announced as clinically depressed. Does a psychiatrist really help? Any response would be greatly appreciated. Have a happy new year guys, I hope that you guys will have a good year ahead",0,1,1,1,1,0

"Hello everyone, I've been struggeling with this issue for a long time now. As long as I can remember, my mom had an odd way of expressing her love and nurturing my growth. I remember when I was 13 she would make me scrub the floors on my bare knees because I didn't help around enough in the house. While doing that she would sing along to a song, calling me a coward and a weakling. She also saw me develop my eating disorder but never said anything untill it was too late. I've lost a lot of weight since then and come a long way but she never fails to rub it in my face. Even if I eat an apple as a snack, she would tell me to ""Watch the line"". These are just mere fragments of how she is towards me. Recently, I was talking to her about life partners. She flat out told me that, if anyone were to love me, they'd have to choose it very profoundly because I make everyone have a hard time. Now, don't get me wrong, I did have a rebellious teen period. I just don't know why she can't get a new image of me? Does anyone have tips on how to survive this passive agressive fiesta my mother has? Maybe things I can do to show her how I've changed?

It's difficult to explain. I AM my thoughts, and my thoughts aren't irrational. I'm not depressed because my ""brain is lying to me"". Why do I sit around not doing anything? Because at my core, I don't feel an intrinsic desire to actually do something that doesn't bring me immediate physical pleasure. I don't reap the intangible rewards of completing goals or learning new things. I just don't care for it. That's a fact. I guess you could chalk me up to a whining child since I clearly don't want to push myself out of the mental rut, and with that I would agree. My values don't exist anymore. I'm a shell of a person and I don't care enough to change that. That's the thing everyone who wants to help just doesn't understand. They can't help me due to philosophical reasons. There's not a thing anyone could tell me that would make me feel as if anything mattered. There's not a thing I could tell myself to change that either. I could mechanically flip the switch on that thought so to speak, but I wouldn't FEEL it. Going with it trying to fake it till I DO feel it doesn't work because it's not GENUINE. That's the thing about major depression. It is a rational reaction and it is a genuine reaction. When someone comes out of it, they don't become ""themselves"" again; they were always themselves. They were able to flip the switch and FEEL it. This, I cannot do, and not because I think I can't.",0,0,1,1,0,1

"Got married at 25 to my ex (then 23) after four years of dating back in 2014. She called it quits by March 2015 after less than a year of marriage. She moved out in April 2015, and I've had very little contact since last Summer.

I've never really had much luck with relationships, i had something serious a couple months back, which actually stopped my lamenting, but it fizzled out pretty quickly and the feelings returned, and magnified with each failure to communicate with any girl im interested in.

There is no doubt that I've definitely lost a lot of years to those same things, but I feel like a large portion of my life has been wasted in school. Of course there is a lot of useful things schools teaches that can be applied in every day life, but school has become the worst part of my day, which is especially troubling since it takes up such a large part of it. And after school, I'm just so drained and it makes me so sad to be alive. You'll probably have it in most school systems regardless of country, but American school are just such a shitty environment for people who have mental issues.

"Basically, I'm a girl who turned 18 in november. I've struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember (I started self harming when I was 12, but I managed to stop when I was around 15 or 16) and this year it's only gotten worse. My friends don't want to be around me anymore because they say I'm too miserable, or I'm ""always in a bad mood"". I suspect myself of having depression and I find it incredibly hard to get excited or happy about anything at all - I seem to have two modes of indifference or unhappiness. Recently (especially in the holiday season) my thoughts are consumed with how much I want to die, how much easier it would be and how little a lot of people would care. That, or many of my ""friends"" whom I thought the world of but I've since come to realise are only friends with me through circumstance, would suddenly care when they are nowhere to be found right now. At this point I have stopped trying to open up to my friends. I took a couple weeks off school last month in order to get my head straight and when asked why I hadn't been in, it very quickly became a competition of ""who has it worst"". I do have one friend who means the absolute world to me and I feel like I could tell him anything, but there's only so much you can burden one person with. I've thought many times about how I could kill myself and I have written notes out for my closest friend and a few other people - at this point, it's just finding the courage to do it.",0,0,0,1,0,1

"I‚Äôve learned that life is fucking sad sometimes. You start to think that maybe things aren‚Äôt going to get better at all. I‚Äôve been at points which I think, it can‚Äôt get worse than this, but then I discover a new section of rock bottom, thinking, ah this is it! I assure you, There‚Äôs always something worse than what you‚Äôre going through. It can get worse. Per that same logic, there‚Äôs always the chance it gets better. I think I hold onto that and you should too. You might have realised at some point, people in your life leave. They come and go, and the only constant in your life is you. You have your back, and that‚Äôs what matters at the end of the day. Keeping this in mind, Take care of yourself and be proactive towards seeking friendships and human connections whenever possible. We humans are social creatures, so having this emotional connection can literally save you. It saved me, at least. I‚Äôm sorry about whatever situation you are facing it right now, but do know that you have a power to improve it. At this point, things can either improve or worsen, and the amazing this is that you have the choice.",0,0,0,1,0,1

Im a grown ass adult whole still can't fucking drive or have a job or even firends I can talk to. I have no one I can talk to I couldn't even text the sucide hotline or contact a school counselor because my anxiety make me want to peel my skin off when I try. I feel trap in a never ending cycle and sometimes it feel like death is the only solution but I'm too scare to do it. And people keep saying it going to get better but its not always the case.

"Hey guys, first time playing here, just wanted to get some opinions. I've been on a variety of antidepressants over the years, and it seems that when my medication is not fully working I get this unwell feeling in my stomach. I'm not sad or unhappy, and it isn't emotionally triggered, there is just this awful feeling my stomach. It's not an upset stomach, it just feels unwell, and it changes my mood because it's all I can focus on. I was on Brintellix for a year and was a miracle drug for me after a year of finding a medication that worked. Symptoms then began about 3 months ago in the form of this unwell feeling in my stomach. We increased the dosage and symptoms went way with the change, and that lasted about 3 months until now. I'm now on Effexor wth mixed results after a month and a half. I take 75MG in the morning but the symptoms arise around the early afternoon. Has anyone ever had similar symptoms linked to their depression?",0,1,0,0,0,0

"Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything. I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy.

Never got any job. I spent last eight years basically 24/7 with either my father or mother. I don't get out without my dad and you know it's enough. He didn't had great life either he worked as police officer he never got any time to relax and rest because he is basically babysitting me ever since he retired.

I can't keep myself sober, and, frankly, I'm out of reasons to bother trying. I like to say I won't make another attempt because of my dad, but some days I think the real reason is because I just haven't stockpiled enough pills yet. This is hard for me to type. I feel like I'm just an attention seeker. And, hey, maybe I am. I don't know. I don't even feel like I should be posting here. I'm not really an immediate threat to myself. I'm just desperate.

"I **need** this year to be better. I'm nearing the end of my third year of college. The new semester is approaching quickly, and I desperately need a good one in order to save me from failing. I failed two courses last semester. I was miserably depressed the whole time and it showed on my GPA. That was my free pass; I can't afford to fail any more. If I do, I won't graduate on time. If I don't graduate on time, I don't graduate at all because they'll cut $8000 of financial aid and I can't magically come up with that money myself. But this year doesn't have to be like that. I don't believe all of the bullshit about how the new year promises change and hope. It's literally just another day, except the year is different. Still, I'm mildly optimistic. I've never been a hard worker, but that has to change now. I know exactly what I have to do to be a successful student; doing it is just impossible sometimes. My depression is like a roller coaster. Before Christmas I felt amazing, and now I feel empty and broken inside. That worries me: if it comes back in full force in the middle of the semester, that could cause a great deal of damage. Regardless, I wish you all a great new year. Hopefully this one won't be quite as shitty.",0,0,1,0,1,1

"2016 has possibly been one of the worst years in my life, at least emotionally-wise. Yes, I've been progressing with my exams, I even got a part-time job and started saving something, but that's all that I've been doing. Last February my GF left the country to study abroad. Little did I know, I went to visit her in April and she broke up with me 10 days later. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions since then, and all I could do to keep me sane was studying and working. I didn't pursue any personal hobbies, apart from some sporadic gaming. I've been literally preparing exams and working almost non-stop and most of the time I went to bed very late. My soul has been sucked out; If I didn't have to work anymore and I finished studying, I wouldn't know what to do apart from staying on the computer. This new year poses some early choices I have to make. I want to do my thesis and continue saving money with my job, but I don't want to be working and studying without any free time anymore.

"As the title suggests I could really use some advice. I‚Äôve been struggling with depression for years, with this latest episode affecting me since mid-November. It is now January 2018 and although I‚Äôve had some good times and didn‚Äôt really feel depressed over the Holidays, it all just came flooding back last night.

When I did I saw all the friends that bailed on me at different parties, surrounded by others, having fun. This sent me spiraling back into depression and I found myself close to ending my life with a belt which I‚Äôve read can be very painless.

It‚Äôs now 1:30 in the afternoon and I still feel the same way with absolutely nobody to talk to about this because I don‚Äôt want to be that person that brings somebody down on New Years. It just feels as if no matter what medications I take, whatever therapist I have, and even with these group therapy sessions I‚Äôve been attending, I always end up back on the train to death.

"Hey, I've struggled hard with depression and I'm currently grieving a suicide of a loved one. Not feeling too great at the moment. I'm offering a song to any of you who want one. I will write and record a song about you or about any topic you would like. It will be free and with the hopes that it makes your life a little bit better, even just for a moment. I'm a musician and I love writing songs about other people. About 4 years ago I wrote 30-40 songs for people on reddit and it went really well. I was thinking of doing it again and decided to offer it to you guys first. My songs are humorous in nature however, if you tell me anything I shouldn't say, I'll respect that. &amp;#x200B; Edit: 1 minute after I posted this, someone wrote something that they deleted.

"I really don't know if this is the appropriate sub-reddit for this but I find it really funny when I become suicidal. The intent to kill myself is very strong and it reaches the point that it creates a heavy feeling in my brain and renders my progress with my mental health null. I am quite aware of the progress I made the past few months and I have even considered myself depression-free until I had an episode after feeling very stable for three weeks. I realized that depression isn't a one-time thing that can be cured with constant means of pharmacology. I am now in this state of wanting to kill myself (again) but is too lazy to get a knife downstairs. I would know damn well that this feeling of emptiness and being suicidal will subside after this episode. Any tips to overcome this recursive state of mine? However, I might break out of this laziness phase and actually do it.",0,1,0,0,0,0

"In 2014, I first entered university and encountered a lot of changes: new people, new environment, new classes, and so on. At the time, I had a lot of acne, which prevented me from meeting people. Furthermore, I had an identity crisis and started asking fundamental questions of life such as: ""who am I? why am I here? where do I go?"", and constantly thought about life and death. I wanted to harm myself and other people because I was in such a lonely, miserable spot when everyone else looked so happy. This lasted a few months. In between, I picked up lifting weights, practiced meditation, and my acne cleared up. Fast forward 5 years, I am completely happy. I have good friends, a good relationship with my family, and I have a stable career. Since my environment improved, my negative thoughts subsided.

Here is my reasoning behind this feeling, most people I know or have met when I was smaller said I was really charismatic, outgoing, etc but that I changed all of a sudden what I can guess was when I was around 6-7 based in the few memories I have. I became serious with out any sign of change and now I don't care about anything, but mean absolutely anything it is what can only be described as ""detached"". It could have been from suppression of who I am since that age because of people having expectations for me resulting in me not developing any real hobbies/interests and knowing how to express my likes/dislikes or due to some other events that led me to suppress myself.

First time on antidepressants but I've been on them for 4 months now. I like the meds I'm on now and if I have an issue then I'll make an appointment with my psychiatrist is what I thought. But when I called my pharmacy they said I was out of refills. Is there any way I can just keep getting refills without having to keep visiting my Dr to renew the prescription? Is there a reason why I need to keep seeing this psychiatrist just to sit in a waiting room for 2 hours just to say hey I need refills?,0,1,0,0,0,0

"Hi guys, Looking for any help I can get! I've been on Pristiq 100mg for 10 years. (Stupidly got forced into it at 18 when my brain was still maturing). Spent the last two years on 50mg, and the last 6 months cutting it in half, then quarters, then 8ths. (I know you're not meant to cut them, but all docs seemed to have no idea what to do.) I really haven't felt sad or hopeless since I was about 20ish, so have just been taking them as I could never get help or instructions for tapering off from docs. These last 2 weeks, I've stopped taking the 8th of a tablet and oh my God. I don't know who I am. The side effects are terrible. I am jumbling my words, mental blanking so hard that some days I can't remember how to get home, or find my car in the car park. Extremely angry and irritable, crying over everything, literally a cute freaking dog on TV. I forget basic words, today I referred to the pantry as the bathroom, just weird shit.

Please help me :( Edit: Idk if anything Im writing makes sense but I just feel so hopeless and I kind of want to fight against it but most of the time I dont feel like I even have enough power to reach out for help and just let myself drown in my despair and pain. Can anyone understand me?,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Good Evening, everyone. I landed a job interview tomorrow. It's my first job interview since I got fired from my old job and checked into a mental institution/rehab February 2017. I've been clean and sober since the 23rd of February, and got on a mixture of different antidepressants (Lexapro, Mirtazapine, Seroquel). I'm anxious as hell and I feel like I'll fuck this up. I really hope not. The starting pay is a little higher than my old job and I actually get benefits with this new opportunity. Hell, even the work hours are great. I just can't shake the feeling I'll fuck up. I really don't want to fuck it up. I feel like my medication has been helping for the most part, but shit. I still can't get the idea that I'm a fucking hopeless drug addict out of my head. That I don't fucking deserve a second chance at doing something in my life. Wish me luck, everyone.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"Hey guys, I've been depressed, anxious and introverted my whole life but I've kinda learnt to live with it. Recently since I don't sleep much and I have a lot of down time to myself I consume myself in my thoughts. Yesterday my girlfriend dumped me, it was genuinely sick, we had been dating almost 7 months and when she dumped me she laughed and smiled and treated me like shit. It was also my birthday. I loved this girl, I put in so much effort to be a person suited to society and not an overly cynical, disfunctional boyfriend in order for her to like me and so I could find happiness. I'm sitting here now writing this because I have no one, I feel physically sick with the way she is treating me and how once again she has abandoned me. She is fucking with me, ontop of all the bad shit that has recently happened to me. I can't function now, I feel so helpless, I don't know what to say or do, I constantly feel overwhelmed with anxiety. I haven't been this depressed in years. This is such a dark place and I have no one. I just want to end it. Please anyone give me some advice.",0,0,0,1,0,1

"Throwaway, because all my friends and such know my account. I know they care, and that's what hurts me the most. My head has always been a conflicting cloud of thoughts. I keep thinking if I were to die, maybe everybody would be happier. Maybe I'll stop being such a fuck up. Maybe everybody would think of me as this better version of myself after I'm gone. I'm young, and I know there's so much ahead for me, that maybe one day things will get better. But it's been so incredibly hard, and I don't think I can do it anymore. My stay at the psych ward made me behind in school, it made me feel selfish for wanting to work on myself, that I was causing pain for others. I sometimes think that maybe if I was gone, people wouldn't need to worry anymore. I wouldn't need to go chat to certain people to feel better. I wouldn't stay in bed and cry all day about how much I just want to disappear. I've been thinking about hanging myself, but after reading about how much it gets fucked up, I'm starting to think of a different method. I don't know.

"28, Male, Denver, divorced two years ago, then got the greatest job, lots of money, just got laid off... and now I'm broke. Just applied for unemployment... I grew up in a family w mental illness and some abuse, not super close to parents or siblings, or friends really... I have enough friends but... God I just feel like... so fuckin alone now. I need connection and intamacy but I have become cold and untrusting... and there's a part of me that has hope and is positive and strong - and I'm a good man, but I struggle with addiction to niccotine weed and alcohol... and depression... I'm hyper critical of myself and lazy from depression and make all these excuses... like... fuck I just want to hug myself and love myself or meet someone as cold as me and hug them because I know it...

"I do. But I gotta do it again, it's been awhile. Basically: 1.) Horrible genetics. Parents shouldn't have bred. I have several life threatening issues that my parents ignored the obvious early signs of, so my life is severely shortened. And I can barely walk. (No real solution for this one. Besides, you know, ending things myself before I become trapped in my body.) 2.) Shitty in-laws. It's VERY bad. Spent almost a decade patiently convincing my SO that they hate him. Because they do. (Either I keep trying to convince him to stop feeling obligated for people who mistreat him ..or I leave.) 3.) Poverty level. (Randomly succeed at life and afford to live WOW SO EASY AMIRITE. My solution is to keep leaving below my means. Start gambling safely and see what extra money I can come up with.) 4.) No dependable friends. I talk to people easily. Most suck. Most enjoy suffering and pity points. I want people around me where we all want to SOLVE our depression/etc. (Keep trying to establish long-term friendship with people. It's basically endless, time-consuming shopping that we all have to do.) I've been depressed for about 20 years now. I'm pretty good at distracting myself and finding happiness in the tiniest things.

I don't even know myself anymore. I don't have any more passion for things I once did (cooking, massage therapy).
