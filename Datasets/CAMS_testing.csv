"Indubitably, I am not worth anything as a being, contrary to the belief of all redditors who will reply to this, I have never once done anything correct in my life, all I have ever succeeded in has been to be hurtful and disrespectful to others and taking others for granted. 

All I breed is catastrophe. I am not at all talented or skilled at anything in particular, I am below average in every concept known to man. I have no motivation nor intention to progress in my life.

I seem to be an inconvenience, an unpleasant burden towards society. I'd say my existence is more so comparable to a tumor, I am not productive and only produce negative effects on others that unfortunately have the unbearable pain that comes from interaction with someone like me.

Entrapped in this body, I dream of going into eternal sleep, a great rest that lasts to the end of time. I do not have any interest in anything anymore, daily politics bore me a great deal and I'm not at all intrigued by life at all. 

I don't see a reason to not follow through with it when I have no intrinsic value and no drive nor intent to live at all.",1
"Almost everyday I wake up hating myself, why would I hate myself though? I graduated High School, have a loving and healthy family, have hobbies and online friends. Yet I find myself so paranoid and hateful of myself, why do I deserve this life I have?
Sometimes I just wanna scream, feeling like I'm trapped in another person's skin, I feel like all my accomplishments are fake and I'm a useless slab of meat who'll eventually die. I don't have real life friends, post secondary, a job, a car or a license and the closest family I have is 6 hours away and barely talks to me. I want to be happy for the good things in my life but find hating myself all too easy. When I hate myself I feel selfish, like I'm so self-absorbed that I only care about myself. I just want to be happy like people online or in my family, to just always see the glass half full and not always half empty",5
To kill myself if im ugly?,1
"God help me.... I know I should go to the hospital.  I know I have to keep fighting....if only to prove to my children, cursed with these genetic tendencies of mine, that life is worth living.  I made my son promise at Christmas to get help, and he did and he is thriving.  My life long battle is starting to wear on this old soul of mine.  It feels like the same pattern over and over, no matter how many variables I change.  I am a very hard person to love.  My scars and cynicism are just a little too hard for anyone who tries to stay around too long.  Hubby has been in my atmosphere for 7 years...think it's finally getting through to him that I can not change the abuse I suffered, and the PTSD that resides in me and rears it's ugly head now and then.  My mother never wanted me and beat her belly before I was ever born....almost 50 years later and I still feel as unlovable.  I'm so tired.  My kids will be so pissed if I give up....my bf needs me right now....I can't abandon them all....Heaven help me.....I just want it to stop hurting all the time.",1
"I really don't want to do anything anymore. Whatever I do, I'll just feel like a failure. I always feel like a failure and a disappointment to anybody who is unlucky enough to know me. All I do is lay in bed now, go to school, then lay in bed at home. I keep wasting money on stupid shit to try and do something (miniature wargaming, d&amp;d, etc.) but I always just give up and go back to sulking. I fucking hate my life. This is the only place I can vent.",2
"I had a promising academic future. I had a wonderful, sweet partner. I had so much drive. I had so much support. People were proud of me. I have been a medical experiment for 2 years. None of the meds have helped much. I had to drop out of grad school after getting straight failing grades. The love of my life has fallen out of love with me. My grandmother, who raised me, died. I have thousands of dollars in medical debt associated with my mental illness and my only means of work is to take my clothes off and grind on strange men. I hate what my life has become. I hate what it is. I feel like I have nothing left to live for.",2
I'm within inches of losing my job. I (M25) spent the last year at this job spiraling in apathy and it's catching up with me. I've been written up and reprimanded and if I lose this job I'm gonna lose my house and possibly my wife. Wtf do I do? My depression is just fucking my life up again.,2

One think i wont ever understand is my friends getting extremly sad when i mention that i want to kill myself. They always somehow manage to talk me out of it but i dont u derstand why they would. My life's shit and i dont look forward to amything anymore. I really just want to die. Thats literally the only thing that would make me happy. Shouldnt they want the best for me? Why do they always keep me from being happy? And why does it work?,1
"So I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now, and besides all the other upsides of therapy, I think my favorite and also most frustrating part is that my therapist confirmed that I am incredibly self-aware. 

To the point that she usually just agrees with me and I spend a lot of my sessions just talking to myself. Because I already know why my thoughts are irrational. I know I shouldn't let these things bother me. I know I'm not alone. I know this is an ongoing thing, I know, I know I know. 

And that's so frustrating. Because knowing doesnt make me feel any better. Knowing I need to learn how to like myself better and be okay to be alone  doesnt help me actually get there. And when I get there, or think I've gotten there, I dont really feel any better. 

Yes, I'm lonely. I should learn to enjoy my own company and spend time with people who actually want to be with me. Great! Done that! Do this all the fucking time. But I feel the same. I'm still lonely. I still hate myself. 

Worst part is that I cant even blame anyone or anything. I did this. I'm doing this. I'm the problem. 

My therapist part of the problem is that I overthink and keep having these expectations for myself. That I should try to just ""do"" what feels right. But I already do that. If anything, I do it too much. That's why I'm starting to accumulate so much junk in my house. 

Idk. I just wanted to let the usual ramblings in my head out somewhere. I'm tired.",5
"If I could just, stop existing. I would do it in a heartbeat. But I can't... I have to commit suicide in order to do that. And even then I leave footsteps. My family would be hurt.

I just wish that i was never born in the first place. Then a poor family wouldn't have to worry about me. This is one of the reasons i haven't done it yet. My girlfriend would also be very upset. I just want to go without anyone being sad about me, like I never even happened.

That would be so nice",4

"i've struggled with depression for about 6-7 years (pre- high school. now i'm a sophomore in college). a lot of my sadness has come from relationships, being stuck in a shitty town, having friends but not having any GOOD friends, blah blah. i can confidently say i'm over my most recent breakup and i don't really have any crushes on anyone, so that part of my depression has kinda weirdly disappeared? i don't live at home so i finally have the freedom to go wherever and do whatever i want. i have the best friends i could ask for and some awesome roommates. my classes this semester are so low stress it's kind of annoying and i've picked up new hobbies that are fun and make me feel good. 

but now i have a new problem. i'm happy. i think i'm like actually happy, or at least i'm content with how my life is going currently. but it feels wrong? i feel like i shouldn't be happy and i feel guilty for feeling this way. i can't remember one time in my life where i felt like this and it's scary. like really scary. a very small part of me wants to go back and do something drastic to send me into another depression. but at the same time i'm like, no this is what you've been wanting your whole life don't fuck it up now! just enjoy it! but it's hard to enjoy because now i'm uncomfortable. this is all foreign and new and i don't like it. sure, i was sad all the time before and could barely muster the energy to get out of bed and shower or eat, but as least i was comfortable. 

has anyone else ever felt like this? i feel kinda shitty for being uncomfortable and i just wanna know i'm not alone. i totally understand if i get 0 sympathy (like, who complains about being content with life?), but i really feel wrong. it's like i lost a huge defining piece of myself and now i have no idea who i'm supposed to be or how i'm supposed to act without it.",4
I was just prescribed it for my severe depression and anxiety.,3
"Has some of you ever sometimes or all the times tell yourself that ""I hate myself"" like it just comes out out of nowhere? Or ""I want to die"".  Like I can be in deep thought and it just comes out without me thinking like it's a habit or something. I sometimes have to look around to make sure no one heard me. Does anyone ever experience this? Am I explaining this clearly enough?



Edit: thanks for all the comments today wasn't the best day for me or week for that matter. Y'all comments made me feel a little better. Especially Mr. Wicked91 thanks, man!!!!!",1
"I want to die. Im not scared of death, or of what will happen, i have no one, my death wouldnt hurt anyone. But i dont want to hurt. I dont want to feel my lungs fill up with water and not be able to breathe, i dont want to feel cuts all over or a rope around my neck or anything else. It always will hurt. Thats what dying is. I dont want that. But i dont want this either. So im thinking of running away, from home, from society, from life. Maybe i could live in a remote cabin in the woods. Maybe if i had a garden and if i had to hunting, anything but this. I dont want to live this way. I know living on my own in the middle of no where is too much, its impossible to make sustainable, i couldnt get the money to even try, and even then, i cant get out of bed much less do everything. I feel hopeless, even my imagined fanatsy escapism i feel like theres no way out. Maybe suicide is the only option. Idk. I dont have any hope left, my hearts empty.",5
"(Read my previous post to this subreddit for context) 

***TW suicidal ideation***

I've got 318 days left until I turn 25... life hasn't gotten any better, a few things have potential to look up, but my depression and anxiety are definitely winning the battle. I fantasize about my own suicide daily. I daydream about different ways I might die/be killed. I intend to keep my promise to wait until I'm 25 even though I doubt she remembers the promise and we haven't even talked in forever, but man does life genuinely fucking suck. Honestly not much is going to pull me totally off this track at this point... so if I don't decide to vent on here again for a while, ttfn",5
"I reached my limit, nothing helps anymore, I tried everything I could get my hands on. My family doesn't even believe in depression. I'm just a big fat dumb loser, but it doesn't matter anymore, because tomorrow I'll put an end to all of this.

"I feel so worthless for so many years now.

but the past week I feel nothing else than  desperate, pain, sadness and emptiness. 

I've realized there is no one that would be there for me, never. 

I have vacations now for a month. After the first day I felt like nothing. I'm just something. Maybe a part of the nature. I mean I do nothing the entire day nothing at all because nothing helps. Everything is just boring and I don't feel anything. I have no one to rely on, every time when I start to make a friendship the people just leave me after spending too much time with me, I mean when they start to know me a little bit everyone left me. Or they use me. I'm getting sick of everything. 

People say things will get better, I'm happy that this is true for some people but it's not for everyone. I just feel like a shadow that no one ever notices. 

I changing my current state or emotions rapidly. Like the last time I played VRChat (a pc game for the VR, where you can wander around worlds meet other people and so on) I had fun but after one second it despaired and I was mad like hell for no reason. 

I feel like their are more minds inside my own mind. other kind of personalitys. 

I just want to end it all but I'm too weak to do it by myself, I see no exit out of this emptiness it got closed. I just hope everyday to die and to forget everything. Or to stop everything for a few years to take a break and get my shit together, but it's just too late. 

I don't even have a family that I could spend my time with, Not even a friend anymore, Not even anyone. Everything is just overwhelming and too much even there is nothing. I can't even cry.

This is just something to write down my stuff and idk. damn bro I never thought it would ever came to this point",4
"I really want to die. I just don't have it in me to go on any longer. Every single day is pain. And I have really lost my patience to go through it all. This world is just too much. I just can't make myself heard. No one listens. No one understands my fears, my pain. I am tired of begging the ones close to me to understand me. It more than often seems that I am just a burden that they are carrying, and until everything is right with me, they are right, when something goes wrong with me and I need their help, they take up arms against me. I am very tired of all this. I am tired of this life. I don't want to live any more. There is absolutely no joy in my life, just pretence. Every smile is a pretence, every laugh is a sham trying to hide the screams I am screaming inside. And it has been going on for years now. I am so tired. If I were numb, I could have lived through any pain for a long long time, but unfortunately I am sensitive as fuck. I don't know how not to get affected by my mind. I don't know how not to get affected by all the rubbish overthinking that I do. It is all my fault. All my fault. I am a crack. I don't fit here amidst all these perfection, who just can't take my imperfection. I am so tired Maa. Come take me. I want to go back to you. I have had enough with this world. It has been such a long time since the warmth of your void. There was no pain. Nothing to cry the whole night about. No night. No day. Nothing. I was just nothing like you Maa. Why did I have to come here? I couldn't have asked for a life like this, where my own mind becomes my enemy, and I sit like a mute observer, unable to change anything. Just watching and suffering every consequences on this body which won't even be with me when I leave. Why do I suffer so much? What have I done to deserve so much pain? Have I given someone this much pain in life? Maybe I have. And maybe it is all coming back to me. So I beg you, whoever you are that makes all things go.. give it all to me once. Give all of whatever pain you have kept for me, all at once. And release me from this shell. I do not want it any more. I have no use for such an existence. Take me back to the nothing that I always was. I want to die Maa. I've had it enough.",5
"I'm about done here, its time for me to punch out. No friends, no career and no passion for anything. I moved from Texas to my hometown in Wisconsin because it was the last place I actually remember being happy but I've been here for a year now and nothing has changed. It's been so long now that I've felt like an entirely useless waste of space. My family doesn't even care about me anymore but I still want to write something to my mom just so she hears it from me and not a phone call by the police. I just want to apologize for all the time and money wasted on me, I turned out to be such a disappointment and I just want to be gone. I'm saving up for a neat looking revolver so I can at least go out with a bang. I just don't know what to put in the text to my mom,I mean how can I just say that I give up, that the world wins, that they were right about me",4
"throwaway:)

As the title says, I am a very insecure person. I have grown up with parents who gave little affection to me and a narcissistic father who has crushed any self worth I have. Throughout middle and high school, I was popular but at the same time, I was never anyone's favorite person. I thought it was because I never had freedom or a phone during those times. I managed to escape and go to school away from my parents in college, but if anything, I have become even worse. I am so desperately afraid of losing the friends that I have made, in particular, someone who is the FIRST person in my life to have feelings for me. He knows me like the back of my hand, but now that we are doing long distance, it's naturally just harder and sometimes I come off as insecure when I ask him things. Most of the time, he is the only one I talk to about many things such as my parents which many don't understand. I just really don't want to lose him and he has said that he is tired of me being insecure, but I am naturally just not that special or pretty or smart and I can't help it. I wasn't like this when I met him, but I can't stop thinking about how he's going to find someone infinitely better when he starts his new job soon and never look at me again.

I am in college so I have little time for hobbies but I still read and work out in my free time. Most of the time I am studying, but I barely get by in school and can't land an internship for the summer.

Please give me some advice. I don't want to spiral",4
Does anyone feel like the only person that could understand your depression would be someone else that was depressed? But also feel like if they were to date someone who was depressed they couldn't handle it because it might suck you into a place that you don't want to be in again.,4
"This might sound ridiculous, but I want to die, and I'm not severely depressed. I'm approaching this purely philosophically.

The way I see it, my life is more suffering than joy, and that's probably not going to change. In fact, I would say this is true of most people. We spend most of our time doing things we don't want to do: working, cleaning, driving in traffic, feeling hungry, experiencing physical discomfort, etc, etc. Why would it not be better to not exist at all (I don't believe in an afterlife) rather than experience the totality of consciousness?

Now other people will mourn my death, this much is true. But they're going to mourn my death regardless of when it happens. No mourning is avoided by making it happen now. If anything, I'm at a point in my life when no one is dependent on me and my death will have the smallest impact it probably ever will.

So why not die?",5

"So after some deep soul searching the past couple of days i have come to the conclusion that i am still self harming (29/F) but not by cutting myself like i used to when i was very young. I seem to have created this character, or other personality i suppose? Where i just want to fight everyone, and I won't back down, i'm not normally a fighter and every single time i hate myself for my behaviour the day after. I guess my thinking is that if i get myself into fights, i'm going to get hurt and a part of me is hoping to be seriously injured so i can just have a break from life ðŸ™„

"I was going to a doctor who just wanted to prescribe medication, but none of it seemed to really help. And my previous doctor was the same. I tried with no luck to self refer to some mental health places but nothing panned out. I changed insurance recently and had to switch doctors. They referred me to a place which both me and my doctor were under the impression would handle medication and therapy.

So I scheduled a needs assessment and thought, ""finally."" But after the needs assessment they just wanted to refer me to more places. I tried calling most of them and they were either full with long wait lists, no longer existed(maybe wrong number provided) or no answer.

I called my doctor back and they sent a referral to another place, and told me I should get a call within the week. Its been 3 weeks now and no call.

Im starting to think finding treatment is hopeless. And jumping through hoops just to find a potential match is just draining.",3
"Hey guys,

so this is a throwaway account for reasons...

Anyways, I'm a freshman in high school and overall, I have pretty decent grades and I play violin (since preschool) and do sports. I have an extremely caring an overall amazing boyfriend, and an awesome friend who I basically consider as an older brother.

I have nothing to live for. My mother is verbally abusive, and when I call out for help with the few close friends I have left, she says I'm lying and she'll call me out and ruin my life. Now, I don't even know if I'm lying or not. If I am, just ignore this then. I really don't know anymore. Everyday, I'm so confused. I have no right to be proud of anything, and because I go to a really tough high school, often I don't have the time to practice violin (but I do a lot of competitions and honor orch, etc. so yeah not good) and yanno, college applications are coming up and I don't think I have anything to show. I do homework during class so I can finally relax during lunch, but I tell my mom I do homework during lunch to avoid getting my ass kicked. She compulsively checks my phone and reads my texts (more than I have my phone, her reason is that my parents bought it and not me), goes through my stuff and takes it, then tells me she did nothing of the sort, and yet I'm the crazy horrible reputation ruining liar here. I guess I don't even know if I am?

I'm just so tired of it all. I know that there's things to look forward to and live for, but I feel nothing for it. I've had suicidal thoughts and depression and whatever and my mom is saying I'm lying and making it up. I just don't know what to do, because even though I'm just a teenager, I could probably say my boyfriend is the only person I'd want to spend life with if things work out (I've dated before and so has he). But as of now, I'm giving everyone aneurysms or something dealing with me and getting mad at me. My violin and sports are doing basically nothing because I don't have time or energy and this generation is pretty damn good at this stuff. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I know my boyfriend probably would have a really hard time dealing with the fact that I was gone, for a very long time. I've been debating ending the relationship to make it easier on him.

I'm sorry, I don't know what to ask of y'all. Just please help me. I'm talked out. I just don't know anymore. Everytime someone tries to help everything honestly just gets worse. I don't have the energy or the will to eat, or function, tbh.",4
"It would be nice to hear from other people what you're experiences have been like.

When I'm on my own or with people I'm comfortable around, I'm â€œnormal. My version of happy and normal anyway, whatever that looks like with depression wrapped in. 

Then, when I go out in social situations, I'm someone else. I'm frantic, I try too hard to be funny, etc. I'm socially anxious, I guess that's the point.

But I find these opposites in writing too. When I'm writing I'm intelligent, I have a lot to say and offer people. But when I speak directly to people I clam up. I have a tiny vocabulary. I swear a lot. I saw the same words/phrases over and over. None of these things is particularly bad on their own but together it translates into me being a fucking mess. 

Do you ever find you're two different people?",1
"To be honest, I'm 35 not much good has come of things. I studied hard and undertook an education degree at 25. It ended up making my mental health worse and I quit during my prac placement. I finished with a shitty Arts degree, but ended up with Honors...  It's not that I am unintelligent or incapable... In fact it shows some capability but no one is interested in what I do and I have no contacts so it makes it near impossible to get in to the job market.

I have panic disorder,  I am having panic attacks every day now (sometimes multiple times a day) which makes my life insufferable.  I have to use Xanax to maintain some what of a normal life... otherwise people think I am just lashing out at people (I'm not it's the condition). No one seems to understand anxiety, panic, and agitation. Doctors don't do shit, hospitals do even less. I've gone to hospital asking for help and am just put back out on the street.

I have been given Propranalol for anxiety. I have since told the  hospital I will swallow a whole bottle of Propanalol soon and no one cares if I do... It's the same result that I just get put back on the street even when I do ask for help.

I'm about to be made homeless and I can't support myself due to my chronic anxiety condition (panic disorder). My life sucks and there is no way to fix it.

I've suffered domestic violence and abuse in my family from the beginning until now and now I have finally had enough. I have been told to move out of the house I am living in. I have no reason to try or any interest in trying anymore.

If I will not die by Propanalol I'll simply buy barbiturates and do it once and for all properly. At this point the fear of going to prison for buying barbiturates does not bother me. I know how and where to get what I need to die... I have not got long left in this world.",3
"I hate being undesirable. I hate looking at myself in the mirror. Hopefully with this new haircut I could not look as untouchable. Especially since no one has liked me, I feel so pathetic in a way.

It's late and all I think about these hours are either suicide or imagining I am someone else. When I can, I fantasize about how my day would be different if I was a new man.

"Hey can any of you all relate to this? I'm 22 year old male . My Parents divorced when I was 13. While they were married, my siblings and I witnessed verbal abuse, threats, dad pushed our mom, mom crying, dad coming home drunk, and even after the divorce they constantly talked bad about each other . Since the divorce, I became really sad and it follows me until this day. Some days I'm happy and then there are days where I cry myself to bed. The day they divorced, police had to come to the house because my dad was trying to hurt my mom. Soon after I witnessed my younger brother change from an innocent child to a drug addict. My father was an alcoholic who is now dead. My mother had the nerve to say to me â€œI don't why your brother is like this... he didn't have it that bad. My mom really doesn't know the trauma she caused me and my brother. My brother was vulnerable. He needed someone but I was too young to realize he needed help. Not until now .

Whenever I ask for help I get it thrown back in my face so what's the point anymore.

I'm breaking down why doesn't anyone understand that Doormat doormat even when I stand up for myself to try and not be a doormat the shit gets stomped even deeper into every fiber of my being it feels like agony agony agony. I regret everything I'm fucking miserable miserable miserable. I wish I never existed I wish I never made these ties life is awful, why would anyone ever do this to a sentient creature. Life is so fuckkng  horrible. It's been so long now I've been living like this and it's agony what a terrible mother I am can't sacrifice enough, just wish I never existed and I never knew anyone and no one ever knew me",1
I winded up cutting. Broke my 65 days free from cutting. It felt so good to cut,0
I'm pretty sure I'm depressed but my parents don't believe in mental health and I'm too afraid to like go to a school counselor cuz my parents will ground me for just wanting attention or something. I wanna get better but I don't think I can without help of some sort. people say that meds suck and therapists suck and stuff but I feel like anything Is better than how I feel. I feel I need help but I don't know how to get it,4
"This is my own personal experiences not a how too or trying in any way to say my life is worse or the way I cope will help anyone else.

It has been a long journey, a fight every day, sometimes we win sometimes we loose.

Looking back 22 years ago, I was never formerly diagnosed with ADHD or Bipolar type 2 effective disorder, was never diagnosed officially as on the higher function autistic spectrum that all came much later.

The umbrella term seemed to be Reactive Depression relating to not only my Fathers death when I was 12 but my Girlfriend/Wife being diagnosed with incurable cancer at 21.

I spent the following 20 years fighting along side my Wife against this horrible illness that slowly destroyed her body until 20th November 2018 a double cardiac arrest with me standing next to her telling the doctors to stop because I knew she wasn't coming back. (her heart was a 14% functionality due to a silent heart attack 13 days beforehand caused by damage done via medication to keep the cancer away which also caused diabetes and kidney failure).

7 days after she died I was diagnosed with Bowel Cancer and spent that Christmas in hospital having 40% of my bowels removed (I have nodules on my lungs they are keeping an eye on).

Being in the same hospital as Paola died 6 weeks beforehand plus certain pain medication caused hallucinations and the beginning of my diagnosis of PTSD.

No family because my mum by this time was in a care home in late stages of early onset dementia.

It felt like the universe was just hitting me with punch after punch just to see how many times I could stand back up.

6 months on no one visiting so outside contact, I was on suicide watch and Samaritans help line actually called me weekly to see if I was still around, I had a plan to end my life, my logic boiling down to the following two points.

If I end my life and that is the end then I am in no more pain.

If I end my life and there is something after I am with Paola.

Had a plan, even down to writing a script that would send out emails to my Doctor and Psychologist so professionals found my body not my neighbors, my dogs had a forever home setup and I was visiting all the forums and communities saying goodbye to all the games me and Wife had played.

I was in a very dark place and the only light was an oncoming train which was either ""cancer comes back"" or ""A life without my best friend)

Everything was black and grey, nothing felt real to me and even when they told me 73% chance my bowel cancer wasn't coming back I couldn't smile and be happy.

**What changed ?**

One of the last places that I was going to visit was the game The Division, it had many good memories of us both exploring, shooting out windows, messing around, I did a walk through saying goodbye to my wife, and as I logged off an advertisement for The Division 2 came up and I thought to myself, ""lets see what mess they have made"" ""No reason to keep my money if I am going to end things"" So I bought the most expensive pack, downloaded it and logged on.

Something amazing happened, the next morning I wanted to log back on, I hadn't gamed since Paola had died, I hadn't interacted, talked or blown anything up.

A few days later I wrote a reddit post on that forum thanking the developers for saving my life.

The response was amazing and people started saying why don't you go on youtube, on twitch, why don't you talk about your experiences, mental health, cancer, diabetes, dialysis, heart disease, why don't you tell the world about how gaming helped you.

My response was ""what have I got to loose"", I watched my wife die, could anything anyone said about me making a fool of myself online ever come close to this.

I bought a mic, I bought a webcam, I did cooking videos, vlogs, streaming and those victories really helped me go from day to day.

I never missed a day at least 1 video every single day went up on youtube and twitch.

I have close to 500 followers on Youtube, close to 1000 on Twitch, others follow me on Facebook, Reddit and Mixer, I now multi stream to all 4 main places.

Am I still broken yes, I am classed as severely disabled, some days It takes me coming down stairs 3 times for me remembering to brush my teeth or do laundry.

I spend a lot of time in VR Beat Saber, SkyrimVr and others, Valve sent me a Valve index with no strings attached, after reading one of my posts (both me and Paola were involved in VR since 2016 due to her disabilities it was wonderful).

VR is an amazing tool for fighting depression, the complete immersion of being within a game be it a horror, a rhythm game (I have no rhythm), or fantasy, can help switch your mind to a world where life makes more sense.

My Senior Psychologist and 2 of my specialists have signed off on me all feeling that Gaming, VR and my Vlogging actually have given me a level of existence and a place to be.

I still suffer from depression but this is how I cope, I still need post it notes on my walls to remember changing clothes, washing and shaving.",3
"I've had SI since I was like 8 years old, and I'm 34 now. I've thought many times about what I would put in the note, who I would address it to. Would I write multiple messages, or only one? 

Tonight I actually opened up wordpad and started composing it. I'm just so tired. I'm so tired of feeling like every day is a fight just to exist. I'm so tired of fighting self-destructive impulses and not winning, I'm so tired of feeling guilty because I'm using up the Earth's resources. 

I *know* my husband would be a happier person if I'd just grabbed some balls and taken care of this years ago. He could find someone who actually contributes to his happiness instead of having to support me through my never-ending nonsense. I stood in the way of his chance to establish a new relationship a few years ago. I should have just packed my things and gotten out of his way, but I was selfish. I'm so fucking selfish. If I really loved him I would have let him go to find happiness, instead of expressing my own emotions and selfishness and guilting him into staying with me.

I'm aware that I'm not adequately considering his agency in this evaluation, but I'm also aware of his background. Religious guilt, familial obligation, he's the one who wanted to get married, etc will all contribute to his feeling of responsibility. 

I've almost posted here so many times, but I've always talked myself out of it in the past. I'm not calling a hotline and taking up resources from someone who might actually benefit from them.

I'm also too chickenshit to actually do anything about it. I'm terrified to wind up locked up again (have done a stint in a psych ward at 18 and being strip searched is not something I'd ever wish on ANYONE). I just know I'd fuck it up somehow and not actually complete killing myself, and then I'd be stuck even more miserable.

I don't want to die, I just want to have never existed.",4
"I'm supposed to kill myself on my 20th birthday. On some days, the only reason that I even function is the thought of me killing myself in the near future. I really can't wait for it. My whole life is starting to fall apart slowly and slowly. My whole body feels so tired and just wants to rest.",5
"I didn't get into med school. My boyfriend is mad and ""disappointed"" in me because I won't tell my parents. He thinks my family can do something because I have connections to a school. I don't want my family to contact the school because if I didn't get in I don't deserve to get in. I'm just a disappointment to everyone. I don't deserve anything. If I'm not smart enough to get into grad school I don't want to live anymore anyways. If I'm not smart I'm not worthy of living.",2
"Our relationship was the best up until the 19th of February. I let my insecurities, fears and depression get me and I overwhelmed him. I drove him away and now it feels like we dont know each other. all our conversations are one sided. I haven't seen him for weeks except for the two times I asked to talk to him. I'm in a worse state and the only way I can win him back is to get stronger but I cant. every day I come home, lay on my bed, stare at the wall, cry and remember this all my fault. He's a good person and he doesn't deserve someone ruining his happiness. today I'm preparing myself to let him go. I love him with all my heart but I cant stand it anymore. I want to get stronger but I just cant. All my friends dont know about it because I dont want to overwhelm them like how I did with him. Again, I felt alone. And I hated it. Why couldnt I be happy like 2 months ago? Why did this sadness come back? This is much stronger than what I felt for the past 11 years. Buy when the day comes where we part. I dont think I'll ever truly be myself. I made myself worse. And I just let it happen.  I keep making myself worse. I hate myself for that. I really want it to work out, but maybe it's too late for that. the damage is done.",4
"A bit of background:
I'm 25, F and live in eastern Canada. I live in a small town where more people here fake being ill to get out of work or have other habits.

I've been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember being alive. I was first fully aware that I wanted to die since I was 6, I've begged for it every day of my life since then and every birthday, that's what I wished for; even til this very day. 



I've been going to a doctor in my town to continue working on my depression, she prescribed me medication which started to make my state worse by an increased amount of suicidal thoughts, more flashbacks, and now irritation as well as mood swings. I've been diagnosed with PTSD, Dysthymia and Anxiety. I'm constantly trying to make it a point to address to every doctor I've been to in the past 8 years that I literally hate being alive and I've even been honest as to how many times in a span of a year Ive tried to commit suicide, even up to date. I've tried signing myself into our local hospital to try to be admitted to get real help and they've only ever kept me for a night each time. Ive begged to stay and I'm still sent home since I seem calm. 

I have always acted like I was fine in front of people since I was raised that it was not okay to be depressed or show negative emotions as I had an abusive mother. Because of that, I can't express sadness normally, instead I just seem calm and most thing I'm being sarcastic or trying to be funny. I don't openly cry in front of others since I honestly hate people seeing me cry when I'm a support figure for a lot of people I know. 


I've tried making appointments with psychiatrists (we don't have psychologists at our hospital, they're hours away and I can't drive), but they often push Ativan which doesn't react well with me. I've spoken to therapists and they have said I'm getting help in that way but I also need to be medicated if therapy isn't doing much for me. 

Does anyone know what I should do?
I can't keep fighting this anymore. I've been doing all that I can and I feel like it'll never get better when all I do is hide in a bathroom and cry each night, wish that I was dead if there's no fix for what's going on or just isolate myself from others so I won't be a burden anymore.",4
I've reached a new point in hating myself I constantly feel as if I'm worthless and not good enough. I think about the days where I could just wake up and be happy and how I'll never feel that again my life's been hell for 3 years. I am not good enough for any girls because my body is disgusting and I can't speak to them to save my life. I truly have no worth so little that my dad doesn't even love me. I'll be graduating hs in a few months and I'm scared because I know I'll fuck up my whole life with my shitty decision making why the fuck did I have to be alive,1
"Life was really great but then things just completely changed and now life is just really horrible. I find myself thinking about suicide more often, and I thought about it before during a bad time, but now I'm just more sure that I'm gonna do it and I'm kind of relieved about it. I can imagine myself about to die, and I'm not as fearful as before. Anyways, I'm thinking of making a plan soon, and I'm thinking about hanging or maybe even using hydrogen sulfide (detergent suicide). If anyone knows anything about using hydrogen sulfide and any discomfort associated with it, I'd appreciate learning about it :)

I'm so exhausted guys, I just wish I had someone to talk to but I feel like I just get this weird feeling that stops me from talking about it to a specific person. I hope I can end things peacefully. Thanks for reading.",5
"Let me start of by saying I'm not diagnosed, I haven't really experienced any traumatic incidents in my life and I have no intention of harming myself.

However, due to events in recent months, I feel so empty, like I don't give a fuck about doing anything. Even feeding myself has become something I try to avoid. I don't take care of my appearance, I do the minimal work I need to get by and I rarely socialize with the few friends I have.

These are part in part to a belief that has formed in my head: life is meaningless. What is the point of doing anything? We slave away through school, to get a place at university, then we slave away through uni to get a good degree, then we slave away in a job we will probably hate to make sure we don't end up on the streets. All this, all this pointless cycle and in the grand scheme if things, it makes no difference.

I think a lot of times to myself, if I were to disappear now, would anything be affected? Have I had any impact at all on the world? Will I even be remembered? The answers are always no. This has produced an emptiness inside me.

The emptiness leads to a lack of people, activities and more, which in turn leave me feeling lonely and unfulfilled respectively. Yet I again feel a lack of desire to do anything. I don't know what this is or why I think like this, but I would appreciate it if anyone could give me some sort of method or exercise to break this cycle.",5
A terminal disease looks like it's my only escape. Going to focus on getting terminal cancer or maybe sudden death due to heart problems. Wish me luck. I'm serious. I'm done with life.,3
"I'm 24 years old. I've consisrently failed at pursuing all my dreams. A year or so ago I broke up with my ex girlfriend. I met her 2-3 years ago, memory is getting foggy, I'm sure y'all understand. Before that I was lied to, cheated on by the few other girls I'd been with. She dropped into my life out of nowhere. I met her online and at first we were both apprehensive... I didn't want to get hurt more but she was there for me. She helped me see therapists for my disorders, she helped me get out of bed and go to work every morning. We lived in different timezones and she would stay up through the night to wake me up in the morning to hear my voice. I fell in love with her. She said she loved me too. I flew her to where I lived and she took two weeks off her work which she takes seriously. She maintained she loved me, things were even better than she had hoped. After she left everything started slowly crumbling. I was getting worse without her and she couldn't deal. She couldn't deal being away from me, according to her, and I could see my disorders were bringing her down, even when I was on antidepressants. She eventually broke up with me. And it's been a year, and I'm living with someone else. She's living with someone else too. I don't feel anything anymore guys... I just try to not cry every day. I'm not fucking happy. I miss her and we text occasionally, she knows what she wants, and it's not me. I've lost interest in even sex now, worse than with the SSRIs. I really don't know how to keep going. I tried moving on, I tried changing homes, I tried pursuing passions but everything just falls short. I feel like I'm just pretending I care about things in hope that I eventually will and this torture will end. I just hope I don't have to live this fucking broken.",4
"So life is okay pretty good I guess wish we made more money but I'm happy. Or I'm not. Doesn't matter I still feel the very VERY strong need to kill myself and it lasts for a while like a week or for a short term like a few hours. Sometimes I feel like I have to slit my wrists in a tub or put that bullet in my brain or swerve into a truck but I know better. It's something in my brain that is triggering this. I am a Christian a real one and I ask God at times to take this from me and it helps but it's like a voice a little guy on my shoulder waiting and watching and anything can trigger it. UHG! So frustrating. I think about how my dog, my husband, my brother sister and nieces and nephews need me but the voice doesn't care. I was just wondering if there is a part in the brain that does this? I have never done hard core drugs but my mother was high on speed when she was pregnant with me... and she has a dopamine issue because of all the drugs and falls into deep depressions or gets suicidal from it. Maybe it's hereditary or maybe because of the drugs she did when pregnant caused the issue with my brain? Anyway any thoughts would be helpful thank you in advance.",2
"I can't put it into words all the time but depression to me feels like I go through life with this tight tight pressure just squeezing on my heart all day long and I just have to ignore it and go throughout my day with nobody knowing what's going on. But when I snap and I cry it's because the pressure has just built up too much and I just can't handle it anymore but I only snap in private because once you cry and once those emotions are out of your system and you have momentary relief you think, well that was silly and it's not that deep I'm fine. And then this cycle of pressure builds up all over again and you just have to pretend like nothings wrong but you're truly not ok. 
I can't explain this to the people in my life cause I've always thought maybe I'm just making up my depression because I can go throughout my day. I'm not bed bound. But if I reflect on my life, I've always tried to cope in some way. I used to binge eat so much and I notice I have the urge to do it whenever I'm feeling especially down. Then it was movies &amp; tv shows I would drown myself in for hours and hours. Then it was music to drown out my own thoughts. It was reading endlessly at some point but I've lost all interest in all of those things and I find being awake to be so draining so now all I do is go to my classes and go to sleep. I hate being awake. I hate feeling this pressure in my chest and it sucks because I was free from it for a few months and it's back and you just try and tell yourself you're just having a bad day but you know it's some sort of relapse. It's hard because I don't want to take medication, I don't know if that's going to make things worse for me and I don't want to be numb I just don't want to feel pain. On top of that there's so much fucking stigma. I can't talk to my parents about it cause whenever I do they get angry I feel sad because I'm their eyes they've given me the perfect life despite all the abuse when I was a child. I can't talk to my friends cause they're all optimists with the â€œit gets better attitude and it pisses me off cause all I want is to get held and just cry. I always feel like I'm being punished for something and I don't know what cause I try so hard to be there for others. Whenever I can't find love and I see ordinary people super happy in relationships I question what's wrong with me (I'm not saying I'm super attractive but I have assets that would at least attract people). when I start questioning why I can't find a good relationship or someone who likes me it loops back into my thought of well how do I expect that to happen if my own father walked out on me as a child. Everything just fucking sucks and I can't even focus enough to do my uni and It.just.sucks.",5
"Hey, this is really weird for me and I wouldn't normally do something like this but I don't really know what else to do. Ever since I was a little kid I have thought life was pretty pointless and I kinda just wanted to die. As I grew up it gradually got worse and at this point I seriously just want to kill myself. I don't have a bad life or anything I have just been searching for so long and I've never found a reason to want to be here. I have always had a problem making friends, I am always there for people and I love being able to help people, people just don't like me. It could be a perception thing tho. In any case, I just spent two years with someone who I believe to be one of the most amazing people in the world, I loved him so much and genuinely thought I would spend the rest of my life with him but he broke up with me. He told me he was never happy with me and it broke me. I have met millions of people and I don't believe I will ever be happy with someone like I was with him. I can't be happy without him and he can't be happy with me but to be his friend and see him happy with someone else would tear me to pieces. Everyone says I'll move on and be happy again but it's been months and it still feels fresh as the day it happened. The only reason I am still here is because of my mom. She guilt trips me into not committing suicide even though she has also always been suicidal. She also doesn't believe in therapy and thinks making your bed will make the depression go away. The idea of killing my self isn't scary to me and I know the people in my life will be sad but I am not enough of anything to anyone for it to be a big deal. Idk why I'm posting this, guess I'm just wondering what other people think about it.",4
"The other day I realised that how I felt wasn't just my pain it was my mother's too. 

I haven't felt suicidal for about a year now, in fact after recent medical problems all I've wanted to do is live a normal life. I have always been a sad person, naturally and I suppose this can take a toll on the people around you but it was only the other night that I saw just how much it could. 

Every night my mother stands outside my door and says â€œGoodnight love you sweet pea to which I ALWAYS reply. Except this night I had a headache so I forgot about staying up later than my parents so I could check all the doors were locked. Instead at around 9 I went to sleep. About half an hour and a half later when my mum was going to bed I woke to see her standing at my door. I was half asleep so I said â€œI'm trying to sleep and she apologised and went to bed

The next morning I questioned her on why she stood at my door and she said â€œEvery night I say goodnight and it's not just to remind you it's for me to check you're still alive but last night you didn't respond and I went to go to bed but I stopped went back an said goodnight through the door again and you didn't answer so I opened the door and thought oh she's asleep but then as I walked a way a voice in my head said you were dead so I stood at your door waiting to see you breathe. 

The point is even though I moved on and that I haven't felt depressed for over a year my mother still does every single day. No mother should have to worry like that. It's not selfish and I'm not saying that I'm just saying that it's not okay.",4

"Disappointed
That's the one word I would use to sum up the way I feel. Disappointed in everything. 

Myself, for being...mediocre. That's the only word that comes to mind when I consider my life. I've been given so many gifts and people that love me, and I waste it all. I don't quite understand what's wrong with me, but I know there's something not clicking right in my brain. People talk about a certain fire behind someone's eyes, a drive that pushes them to work hard for their goals. I dont have that. I'm not passionate about anything. I find myself with no motivation to do anything, even doing days without eating. Some days I'll be how I used to, full of energy and making people laugh, but, as quickly as it appeared, it's gone. I'm back to laying in bed all day, not speaking to anyone, not doing anything that I'm not required to. The only thing that impresses me anymore is how easily I lie to my own family. As soon as they call, I become this other person. The person they want me to be, who does well in school and never had any issues. 

I don't feel joy anymore. Not a trace of genuine happiness, other than the aforementioned 'good days'. Even the things that used to make me happiest, like Christmas, now just seem annoying and pointless. I can't sleep, often laying awake for hours on end. 

Fuck, I miss him. I miss my Da. I would give anything in the world for 5 more minutes with him. He was everything to me, my whole world. I loved him with everything in me. You could come to him in the worst possible situation, and he would tell you what you needed to hear, and you would always come away feeling better. But now he's gone. He left, leaving a mess that my family has yet to fix, and now I'll never see him again. Never hug him, or hear his roaring laughter. I'll never again have him look me in the eyes and say ""I'm proud of you, son."" And that breaks my heart. Sometimes I go back and listen to old voicemails, just to hear his voice. 

I'm disappointed in my family, some more than others. We all came together as a family for the funeral, and not even 24 hours later they're already fighting. I don't understand what I have to do to let them know I need help. I shouldn't be too hard on them, but if my friend who hasn't seen me in 3 years can discern I'm struggling over the phone, surely my own family could tell. I told them I wasn't ready to go back, that I couldn't handle it, but they didn't listen. I've never once in my life had real freedom. Freedom to choose what I want. Thats not exactly true. Theres 2 options: do what they want, or be on my own. 

Disappointed in those around me. Now, I could never blame anyone here for my problems, but damn if they can't tell. There are people here who's job it is to identify people who are struggling. They haven't approached me, nor have any of my 'friends' here. I went to the counselor once, and after an hour of talking, he told me that he thought my Das death might have had an impact on me. No shit. Say what you will about my high school, but I'm more comfortable telling anyone there that I'm struggling than I ever would be here. 

I don't know where something went wrong, where I lost my drive, but I want to fix it. I want to be happy again, but every day that seems farther away. Every day, I feel less like myself and I just want it to end.",4

Fuck I want to die. I want to die as painfully as I can. I want to be flayed, burned, and disemboweled. It's what I deserve in life. I've caused so much pain for everyone around me. I fucking hate myself beyond words. I can't think of anyone I hate more than myself. I just want to die. I want to die so, so badly. But I can't do it.",2
"I used to bottle things up. Hope they would just pass without causing any problems... they usually would and because of that I thought it would be a good way to deal with stress and all of that. I was wrong. Ever since I tried being more and meeting more people and making my life more exciting it just hasn't worked. If anything it made things worse. Stuff just keeps getting added to my bottle and now the cap doesn't even fit on the top. It's affecting the people I'm around and I don't like it but I also don't want to tell them what is wrong because I don't want them to worry or be concerned. My feelings are leaking and I don't like it because they are noticing. I feel like I'm doing more harm to them by not telling them. I just want everyone to be ok but I don't want them to know...suicide has been a very present thought in my head but I don't want to leave...it would just hurt them more..hopefully my thoughts on that won't change or else I won't be here for long...

Sorry if this is worded very poorly I'm just trying to type as it comes to mind",5
"I know im going to kill myself, I've known it for 7 years, Ive been mentally ill since I was 6. I know what the end game is, the only thing unsure is the timeframe.",0
"Feel free to downvote me into oblivion or to just move on. 

I just can't do it myself. I want to die. In fact, I can't actually envision a future for myself. The way some people see themselves getting married, having a career they love, having children, etc., I just don't see that for myself. Instead, I only see myself dead. Sadly, I don't have the strength or fortitude to end my own life. I have a plan for ending it all, but I just don't think I could actually follow through with it. 

I have a fear of commitment, and committing to that decision is something I just can't do. Several times everyday, I daydream about someone walking up to me and killing me. If someone else did it for me, it would make things so much better. Ironically, this makes me want to self harm, but self harming itself has left me with scars that make me feel worse about myself which, in turn, makes me want to end my life or self harm more. Despite what a lot of people say (or will say), I just don't think there is a reason for me to continue living.",4
"I (edit : 20f college student ) hate it the feeling of waking up everyday with the same two thoughts "" I wish I never woke up. Oh well another day that I can't wait till it's over"" I feel empty emotionless and sad I have been feeling like this for years(4 years). I thought about ending it millions of times. It's still tempting to this day. I wish I would have someone to talk to but I don't want to burden anyone with my feelings. I hate myself and everything around me and these days it's been getting worse and worse. More emotionless and more empty. I want to cry but I literally can't find tears. The problem is I don't even know what's wrong with me or what's bothering me or how to fix it. I feel so alone. I am an introvert with hard times expressing what my feelings are. And whenever someone notices something is wrong I have the tendancy to avoid them / put alot more distance. This is my second week of only sleeping 3 hours a day... I am still wondering how am I even standing up. I can't remember the last time I was happy or laughing from my heart. I know that everything will be okay but what if okay comes too late...

"Hi guys, 

Just wanted to know - do any of you have really awful/vivid nightmares when sleeping? I find mine have been getting worse and worse as my depression ebbs and flows: 

A lot of times they involve me being back in high school or college and forgetting classes to go to, or being in high school at age 30 while everyone else is in their teens. Other times I dream about moving away from home and I struggle or my car breaks down and I cannot get it fixed. 

I also dream about my job and stuff sometimes too. Anyone else have this?",2

God created mankind
Why was He having such a bad day

A face that no longer exists
Deep inside you are merely a mirror image
Of all my atrocities
The ugliness that exists outside
Lives inside every one of you",0
"We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",0

"I have been dealing with depression since my mid-teens. It comes in waves. I go from a deep depression to a more mild feeling, but it's always there. As I got older, the low tide began to stick around longer than the high tide. I have tried numerous prescriptions with no result, and no other form of therapy has caused the slightest change in the way I feel.

For the past year, I have lost all enjoyment in every aspect of my life. Usually this passes but this is the longest stretch I've had. It's almost like I've come to some sort of acceptance that this is how I'm going to feel forever if I don't end it.

The current climate of the world (I don't mean Global Warming) has also pushed me the closest I've ever been to ending it. I used to enjoy movies, music, television and video games as a form of escape. I can't enjoy them anymore. The hyper-politicalization of EVERYTHING has corroded away the enjoyment I received from the few things I used as an escape.

I am very good at hiding my feelings, and nobody knows about my thoughts and plans for suicide. My friends and coworkers all know me as an easy going, relaxed guy. I also don't want them to know, so it's a full time job on top of my job to keep it up, and it's exhausting.

I made plans on how I would do it during my last low point, and I'm closer now than ever. I have all the means to pull it off, I just have to do it. 

I'm also not sure why I posted this. Maybe a way to flesh out a suicide note. I've been on reddit for years, but never posted. Maybe I'm just knocking something off my bucket list before I let go.",5

**TL:DR**
I have done a lot of reading when I procrastinate from work. I want to start a daily journal on reddit to keep track of my positives and negatives, my progress, and hopefully get advices on when I go wrong. 
I noticed that I get overtly stressed over tiny chores/work/things to do, and I'd like to tackle it via progressive increase in exposure and desensitization. Then incorporate other CBT techniques.

***Story/Background:***

I have only recently been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder after a close friend forced me to. Looking back now, I think I first had mild depression around 16yo.
I recall having a general apathy towards life, results, ambition, family, and friends. Any motivation is fleeting and I'd spend most of my days daydreaming. Perhaps hoping for some catastrophe in the school so that I'm no longer bored.
The depression seemingly subsided - at least I think so - as I continued on aimlessly on some path my family/culture/friends expected of me. while I'm not excelling, I'm not underperforming. I have close group of friends and we enjoy movies and outings.
It all went to hell when I was around 22/23yo. I should add that I have Contamination OCD and during my University days, decided against my better judgement that I should live with a close friend.
This proved horrible as my OCD meant I couldn't live normally or telerate their habits. I thought I had it in control and hid my oddities well. I didn't. 

My housemates at the time hated me and talked loads behind my back. All the while I was oblivious about their hatred towards me while they acted normal around me. I noticed somewhere around 3 months in. I had the chance to look through their messages and curiousity started my depression.
Reading through all those hate filled complaints and messages was painful. Having to sleep in the same room as him after was impossivle. To act civil while I moved out was tough. While we did not have a big fight because we both hated confrontation,
our 6year friendship fell apart; along with it, I resolutely cut ties with the entire group of friends that was associated with this guy. 

I believe this to be the ""event"" which kickstarted my depression. Worse still, I moved to a different place and had another falling out with another group of housemates. We started off great, even went on a trip together. In about two months, I don't recall the cause of it. But I remember they confronted me on something and I just started withdrawing from them. 
After that, I stopped going to lectures and classes. I was fired from my club because I couldn't perform anymore. (I spent the first year making it into the committee), As a result, I graduated with a subpar GPA. I've never felt worse. I feel like I disaappointed my dad, wasted his money, and failed to prove myself to those who looked down on me.
I spent the next two years isolating myself in my room, only going out for groceries if I absolutely have to. I avoided the housemates by being active at odd hours. I lied to my family that I was trying and failing to apply for jobs while the truth is I mindlessly watched seasons after seasons of brainless TV. 
I am eternally thankful that my dad supported me through this lie. He paid for my rent, food, and courses I took because I wanted to extend my visa. Oh, I was also an international student so you can imagine how much money that costed. 
I cannot begin to describe the amount of guilt I feel. 

The reason I'm even trying to get better is because of guilt. My main motivation is to make them proud of me.

When I was 27, I spent a year dodging their concerned calls. They were so worried they sent a friend over to check on me. And finally, they took a flight over themselves. My visa finally expired and I went home.
After getting home, I once again lied to them about job searching and spent a year doing my best to avoid family events and outings. Finally, last year they forcefully got me a job with my relatives and I've feel into a routine since then.
I majored in Finance and Accounting in Uni. But my results were subpar and it has been 3-4years at this point. I barely remember a thing and I can't perform. I can't even get myself to pick the knowledge back up. 
Admittedly though, the work I perform doesn't require that much. But alas, I fail to perform. I find it difficult to get myself to issue a simple invoice which takes 5muinutes tops. 

I am more and more disappointed in myself over time. I hate the job, but I haven't even sent out a single resume. The very thought of going for interviews and exposing myself as incompetent frightens me. GEtting judged by anonymous HR people makes me hate myself.
I contemplated all kinds of alternatives ie: getting a remote part time job so that I can make extra income while improving myself. Taking courses online and hopefully put me ahead of others.
Ultimately though, I have not brought myself to do any of those things. Even this reddit post took 5days of contemplating before I could do it.

I know what I should do, and people will say ""you never know if you never try"" but I can't help but imagine the negatives. Posting for help on reddit for example opens me up to judgement from random strangers, trolls, even scams, some of them incredibly damaging. 
Improving myself via courses/books/lectures can be an enormous time sink. Not to mention that what is learned may not even be useful to me in the future and may end up being a waste of time.
Currently, I spend the measly 4 hours of free time I get after getting back from work watching movies or reading novels. They're not entertaining nor boring, but they keep me sane. I dread the day that they are taken away. 


***Analysis:***

Growing up, I've been instilled with the idea that I am smart, but lazy. I believe this became a part of my core identify. I'm 29 and I don't recall ever working hard, for anything. 
I've coasted through life however, largely because my parents made me go to numerous additional tuitions, cram classes, etc. I've never done homework, mostly copied them off of friends, but have the concept repeated to you enough times and it gets carved into memory.
My results up till 15yo were always above average. 

I believe due to the circumstances, I grew up without developing any self-discipline skills. Never having an aim or goal and simply going through the motions meant I was lost the moment those guidance were taken away. Believing myself to be smart also creates a subconcious anxiety - what if I worked hard but still failed? that would mean I'm not smart.

Throughout life, I have had a panic attack twice. Once when I was 10. An art project which took me 20minutes tops was criticised and I broke down in tears and hyperventilated, having to be taken home from school.
The next was when I was 16. Around this time, I was getting progessively more apathetic at school. I struggled to get up in the morning and was often late to school. I was late for 10 times and my parents were called to school which resulted in me hyperventilating once again.
I also spent a lot of time gaming which I believe was some sort of coping mechanism similar to mindlessly watching youtube or browsing reddit. 

Not entirely sure what these events mean. But I think I can conclude that I have an inability to accept criticism or face consequences of my own actions. 

***What I want to do:***

As stated above, I want to tackle my self-disclipline, responsibility avoidance, and anxiety towards work, via progressively increasing exposure. 
I will practice mindful relaxation and attempt to associate the relaxation with the trigger(work).
I will also journal on reddit. 1. To have accountability, 2. to further dissect my thoughts, analyze the issues, solve them. and 3. to get advice.

"Hi so I would like to know what's your opinion on this.

So there was an activity at my college, in which students from different schools were coming the univ to see it and explore it. When they came, the college gave them a ticket to get a free meal. We, students of the college itself, are really unhappy with the university because they always have money for anything but the university itself, charging us a lot of money for things that are not there. So we, unleashed, decided to take back what's ours. One guy printed out a lot (maybe like 15-20) tickets of the food and we went there to get the food by ourselves. So at the end of the day, the food was done earlier than usual. We did it only for 2 days out of the 3 days the whole college stuff was happening.  We didnt do it the last day cause they realized something was wrong and printed out a different ticket. So we didnt go, also because they were being suspicious and asking questions. 

Do you think we are getting punished?it was only like 25 juice boxes and sandwiches, that's it, out of the probably 200 or 300 there were there.


This has me so preoccupied omg.",2
I didn't kill myself cause i'm a fucking pussy. I was too afraid I'll survive and have some serious medical issues. Idk what took over me. I was kinda in a transe and I'm honestly glad I didn't do it.,0
"She was yelling at me about school stuff in the car. I usually stay calm and let her get it out of her system but today I snapped and told her that I'm suicidal, hoping that she'd calm down. She did not. She belittled me for it while I tried to keep myself from crying too much. I tried again, telling her that I want to kill myself and asking if that's what she wants. Her immediate response was â€œYou know what? Do what you fucking want. 

I'm so tired. I'm sixteen, this isn't normal. I defend her at every turn, even now in group chats with friends calling her abusive while I'm sleeping over at a friend's house because the thought of returning home makes me feel like I'm gonna puke. 
I had a vivid image of my dead body covered in blood with a note saying that line of hers and a smiley face. I also want to see the look on her face when I walk up to her with a knife in my hand and tear my wrists open. I want to damage her as much as she's damaged me. 

I'm not as depressed as I normally am, surprisingly. Just tired. She came by with a bag of extra clothes for me and I think she found an empty pack of cigarettes in my closet because she took a shirt of mine that was under it (I hide it between layers). My friend went out to get it for me because thinking about talking to her face to face made me anxious. She blamed him, to his face, for me wanting to switch schools; that he scared me out of my current program. 

I'm not actually going to kill myself or anything, as much as I want to. It's too short notice for me to make any final preparations. But I think if I hadn't called my friend I'd have broken my self harm clean streak and cut down to the dermis again or maybe even deeper. 

The icing on the cake for all this is that I got called selfish by my mom for not coming home. Her boyfriend's mother passed away recently (we live with him) and her funeral is tomorrow. I have selfish timing apparently, and I'm not even the one who started this whole thing in the first place. I've cried so much that I don't feel any strong emotions anymore. All I have right now is sadness, but it almost fades into me being tired. 

I also have guilt. Not because of this but because I have an important group project due tomorrow and I was supposed to make a poster. I obviously wasn't able to complete it. People's grades are going to suffer because I'm too weak to just walk inside the appartment and sit through some yelling     

I just don't deserve to live, I guess. I'm a massive letdown to everyone in one way or another. People would be much happier with me gone, my parents are divorced and though my dad would be upset about losing me at least he won't have to put up with my melodrama anymore. My mom won't have to stress herself out over me being too tired to put effort into school, there wouldn't be any strain on her relationship with her boyfriend anymore because of me. My classmates won't have to worry about bad grades because of a flakey group member. My boyfriend can get someone who won't ruin his mood all the time just by talking about their feelings. My family doesn't have to worry about me being a disgrace or anything, if a member dies by suicide they'll likely just get pity rather than dirty looks after I inevitably become a junkie. 

The only one I would really feel bad for is my dog. I don't see him often, every few months or so. But he loves me about as much as I love him. I don't know how I could ever explain to him, in a way that he'll understand, why I'm leaving and not coming back. Why it's not his fault, the extent of how much I love him, how good of a boy he is. That's just something I'll never be able to do for him. 

Vent over. I need to get some sleep but I don't think I'll be able to get up in the morning. 

If it's any consolation, to those that have read this far, I'm seeing my psychologist tomorrow.",4
"My best friend is literally the sweetest person ever she brought me so much chocolate and facemasks to make me happy, even if its just for a few seconds and I just can't stop crying about that.
I really, really, really want to die, I even cut myself to prepare me mentally for it and if she would have known that I'm doing that right now, she knocked on my door and gave me that. 
I really don't know what to do anymore. I don't want her to be sad because of my death but on the other hand I just can't stand this life anymore. Please help me. She is literally the only reason I am still alive.",4

I posted a cry for help on the confessions subreddit and all the comments and nice things that people said delayed what I thought was the inevitable but then a friend say the post and came and talked me down and I really wish I would have jumped I constantly think about going back to that building climbing up all those stairs getting up on that ledge and jumping and it's getting to the point were I dont think I will be able to stop myself from going there again the instant I can.,5
Things seemed to look up. I followed the light. It was an illusion.,0
"I did something stupid. 

I only talk to one person about my mental health. She is the only person who has ever helped me not be depressed. After being depressed and okay-ish at my best for about a decade, talking to her made me feel happy. And it wasn't just for a minute, an hour, or a day. I felt happy for about half a year. 

That was what led me to tell her. I wanted to thank her, and I couldn't say thank you without telling her why. When I told her about my mental health, she was supportive. Even though I haven't felt happy in about five months, I still look forward to talking to her.

But today I did something stupid. I started an argument over something that so trivial that one noticed it. Usually when I am speaking to anyone, I try to think about what I say before I say it, because I would hate to say anything that bothers people, but not today. Today, I when I was with her, I didn't once stop to think about what I was saying. If it came to mind, I said it. 

I didn't think she was bothered until she told tried to tell me something like ""I spend my whole life making sure I don't... Isn't it ironic that that I end up doing that?"" As she said that, I saw her face get red and ber eyes start to tear up a little. And I realized that I was being a fucking asshole. 

She has never asked me to do anything. Not a single time. She has helped me when I am having suicidal thought. She has helped me when I feel like I am about to have a mental breakdown. She has helped me through a lot. And I just go and return the favor by being the worst person to her.

I have been trying to distance myself from her, because in the past couple of months, life just hasn't felt like its for me. I don't think that I should ever feel better. Depression is exactly what I deserve. Everytime I have caught myself feeling a little better, I just tell myself what I have to feel like shit again. Now, I will find it easier to no longer talk to her. As much as I looked forward to talking to her, I look forward to her forgetting me.

There isn't a whole lot keeping me from having the thought that makes me take my last, she is one of the two things that even just thinking of her helps me keep the suicidal thoughts just thoughts. I think she still wants to talk, and I know I will see her for at least the next 2 months, but when those 2 months are up. I won't talk to her, and I will do everything that I can to keep me from ever talking to her again. I don't want to make her sad or ever make her cry again.

Right now, I know I probably won't gather up the courage to end it, because I still have to see her. But I did resently take up self harm. I started by hitting my upper thigh, so no one would see the marks. Recently, I started growing out my hair, so that no one will notice that I started hitting my head. A while after I see her for my last time, the odds that I'll finally do it will rise.

I fucking hate that I possibly made someone feel anywhere near how if feel most of the time. I hate myself even more for doing it to the only person I have ever felt safe enough to tell everything about anything.",4
"Burial By the Sea

I want the waves to sing me their lullaby 

I want my last sight to be blue

I want to wait five more minutes and see if dolphins guide me somewhere new

It'll be near the cliff side

It'll be near the shore

It'll be so that the sand covers my body to be seen nevermore

Perhaps inside of a tent

To disguise the sight from the tourists' naked eyes

Perhaps outside of the caves

To refrain from having my spirit be alone in the dark

Maybe I'll see stars

Maybe I'll see the moon 

But most likely it'll be when the sun sets after noon 

I think it'll be peaceful 

Not so much for those who find me

But I won't know

Because I'll be home",0

I took antidepressant and antipsychotics. And this time I take 2 capsule prozac every moening. And also I'm going to psychiatrist. First time I've go to psychiatrist is nearly 3 years ago. And I'm going to psychologyst too in last 3 years (not continuonus). But I can't be happy. Always I'm thinking something. I can't be relax. I can't be peaceful.

"I am use to depression causing me to eat tons of food. I self medicate that way, even with meds and therapy- food is usually the only thing that can distract me. 

Now, however, food is bland and gross. I get no satisfaction from it at all and now just eat once a day because *science* says it gives me energy.

Now I feel unsatisfied. It was the last thing I still enjoyed. I can't read, I can't write, my musical instruments (cello, piano, guitar) are literally gathering dust. I stopped playing video games that require thought, I haven't sung in half a year. I hav n't drawn since before Christmas.




Is this life now?",5
Im literally not good at anything... I have no skills whatsoever. Im 19 and I still live off my parents money. I have no job. I don't go to school. Everytime I try to better myself I give up halfway.  Im the biggest disappointment ever. I just fucking hate it. I wish I were just dead already.,2
"The summer of 2019 I started developing severe OCD after suffering from mild, unnoticeable OCD for many years. I just feel so tired of things, so bored of living, but I can't commit suicide.

I know that there are people who care about about me, like my parents, and the shit they would have to go trough if I commited suicide is unbearable for me to imagine.

But I just wished I didn't exist, that I never was born. I wish I could vanish from this world, be gone like the wind.

I often wish I would die in an accident or disease, because maybe that would be less painful for the people around me then if I would commit suicide.

I have stayed home from school for about 2 months because of illness related to the stress, not stress from school, but from my mental health. I feel crippled.

One day I woke up and was completely emotionally numb. I couldn't feel happiness, sadness, anger or any other emotion, but it got better. But I really wished it wouldn't have gotten better, it was ""amazing"", I couldn't either feel anxiety so all I felt was blank.

When I think about the meaning of life I always come to the conclusion that I want to marry a wonderful woman, have kids and grow old and die of old age, and this is the other thing keeping me alive.

That was my story.",3
"I'm posting here because its anonymous and frankly I just wanted to speak my piece before I end it. I feel awful inside, everyday trying to mask the pain with busy work, or arrogance and charm towsrds others to distract myself. I've felt empty for quite some time. I finally opened up to my wife about these thoughts a year ago and she blamed me for how that made her feel knowing I want to kill myself. She left me some short time after. Since then I've had about 6 months of time to really digest my thoughts and feeling. I feel an incredible depression each day and then feel even worse when I think about my children having to deal with my death. For a long time that deterred me from suicide, now it seems more like a valid solution to my pain and a way for everyone to move on. I dont want anyone to find my body which clearly describes suicide. On the contrary I'd like to frame my death so the narrative suggests a noble death and therefore easier on my family. Of course my children love me, but it's been an incredibly long time since I've felt love or purpose. I feel like a paycheck, a slave to everyone else's needs, a pawn in someone else's game. I'm happy that I experienced love, excitement, danger, success but I feel now at the age of 35 the good days of ignorant bliss are behind me. Anyway, just figured I'd put this out here, to people that wouldn't tell me how selfish I am, or how this doesnt help anyone. I just want the pain to end.",4

"For a few months it's been overwhelming. I've lost multiple friends in the last two months alone due to how I act. I dont think I'm exactly wrong, but I only kept about 2 to 3 friends and now they just wont contact me. I feel insignificant contacting them because I've only gotten a response once or twice. I'm falling out of my work schedule, every night thinking of how I would end myself until i realize I'm thinking about it. The past six months have been so hard on me, and I'm only 20. I know i have many years more to live but it feels so hopeless as i think that I'm gonna die one day, why keep feeling like this forever? I feel like I have no hold over my life, I cant stay in one place for long, much less keep a steady job. In the moment I just say fuck it and quit and move on to another, I dropped out and am an alcoholic. I cant clean because it feels hopeless as well, everything just piles up until I'm at this point, and this time i dont know if i can move on. My dreams are repetitive and of the same person, and i cant shake that no matter what i try. Right now just seems like the time to save my family the pain of doing it later and just ending it.

"I know I'm not gonna kill myself, but that doesn't distract me from the fact that I want to. Over these past few weeks, my suicidal thoughts from last year had resurged.. I feel like an absolute failure; an absolute burden to those around me. Every day, whenever I hear someone laugh, I instantly feel as if they're making fun of me. I feel like nobody really likes me... as if all my relationships are fake with others. When people make fun of me, I just let it happen. I either laugh along or smile like a fucking idiot because I don't want to cause any more problems for the person. I feel as if each time I say something, I ruin someone's day. Just today, I said something I shouldn't have... and now I feel like absolute shit even though I apologized after realizing how shitty it was for me to ask that. I don't think he accepted my apology anyways. My grades aren't bad by any means, I have B's and A's in hard classes, but I feel like I'm just crunching under the pressure. My parents hate my grades and all my friends around me seem to just be doing much better than me. I really just think I'm a failure and will never do good in life. I feel like people hate me and view me as a burden. Each time I try something, I never turn out to be good at it. I feel as if I'm bad, or simply average, at whatever I do. I'm not creative, musical or smart. Do I really deserve existing if I can't make a single difference in this world?

I go to a psychiatrist and I am on meds but nothing seems to be working. (Ive changed almost 7 therapists/psychiatrists now because my mental health was showing no improvement.) I feel like a parasite, latching on to my mother and aunts for financial support. I want to move out and live independently but I don't even feel anything. I don't feel like doing anything, let alone wanting to work. I constantly worry whether I'm just being lazy and making excuses or whether I genuinely have a problem. I don't want to face people, give interviews or work among other people. Everytime I get a job I end up having panic attacks and excessively stressing out. The thought of having responsibility and knowing that there are certain expectations I have to meet while working, and the constant anxiety of doing badly at my job trouble me so much.

"I would like to share my situation here presumming this has already been talked about a thousand times. First of all, forgive my English as it is not my first language (Im from Spain).

Im a 26 yo civil engineering, graduated in 2018 after 5 long years of hard study. Before this, I did a couple internships in civil engineering during college. The second one went pretty good and my boss actually wanted to hire me but I decided to leave to start the masters. After finishing it one year later and not finding any job, I ended up in an energy company, in the sales department, a field totally different than my educational background, where I stayed temporarily until I could find something in my field. The thing is, several months have passed and Im still here but also I found out I dont like this job, to the point that it has driven to a state of depression and unhappiness, but still here because of the money. The situation has been aggravated since I cant find anything else, resulting in a feel of no motivation to find other jobs and challenge myself to reach higher in life. Also, I feel that Im not as competent as I should be and that makes me feel bad too. Times is passing and Im still stuck in this conundrum with the pressure of no succeeding. I know this relies in the survival of the fittest and work hard concept but it seems to be more difficult for me. The only times I feel an extra shoot of happiness is when I practice sports or Im with my girlfriend/friends. But then this bleak mental state hits back again.

Wonder if any of you have experienced a similar situation and how have you dealt with it.

Thanks in advance! :))",2
"So I've been depressed since about 4. Started cutting around 12, the same time I had my first flashback to the first time I was raped. I made serval attempts since I was 16, never really trying hard enough. But tonight I really really really wanted to do it. I tried cutting myself but the knife I got wasn't sharp enough... my boyfriend ended up calling me in the middle of everything. So I talked to him about it, I was on hold with the suicide hotline anyways.

I guess I didn't REALLY want to otherwise it would've worked? I've always heard of people just cutting, but it ends up going too deep and that's how they almost die. Don't know why I'm writing this.. actually I do I want to hear from someone. Encouragement, your story, anything.

"&gt; **[Trigger Warning: self-harm descriptions]** I found this in my notes in my phone from 4 years ago. I forgot how much I used to write about what it was like living inside my mind back when I was at my lowest point.

**Chemical Imbalance**  

It always starts with something taken out of proportion. A misread text, a misunderstood gesture, a misjudged opinion, or a misguided tone.  
â€œI love you. They attempt to bring you back to a reasoning reality.  
But love isn't *love* anymore.  
Love is fake.  
Love is wrong.  
Love is *hate*.  
*I hate you*. Their mimicked voice echoes.   
Triggering the avalanche of spiteful words spraying from your pale lips.   
*They hate you*. The voice darkens.  
You watch them slowly fall into your torturous whirlwind of abuse. You watch them cry for help and ask for you to stop and listen to yourself, listening to you hate yourself and want to die is too much for them.  
Then you watch them leave. You watch them run away in fear.   

Your bony fingers crack as they clench into a fist. Your jagged nails are digging into your skin.   
Anger engulfs your vision, taking control of rationality.  
The first blow strikes hard on your face. It stings, but you go a second time. And a third. Until your head starts ringing.   
*You seriously fucked up this time*. The dark voice echoes.  
You can't see anything for what it really is.  
â€œBut you said they hated me! You argue with the little self-worth you have left.   
*Yes, and you believed me. You stupid little girl*.  
That restless feeling of guilt starts trickling down your spine. Did you jump to conclusions? Did you just impulsively hurt a loved one's feelings? Did you just make them witness something so traumatic it will never leave them?  
*Yes, you're a twisted abuser*.  

No, you can't be here. You can't be alive anymore. You don't deserve it. You have hurt someone who needs you, you have acted out of spite.  
*Do it. You're worthless. They don't want or need you here*.  
More impulsive actions unfold, you only want to escape the guilt and anger that overfills your head. But you're scared to do it. You're scared to make the final exit by your hand.   
*Cowardice. You can't live and you can't die. You are pathetic*.  

The razor is in view. Tears are finally pushing out, causing more pain than the blade that now pierces your skin. Scarred and thin, the skin breaks. But no satisfaction is found unless you cut too deep. Only disappointment seeps in, blaming yourself for your cowardly slashes. Not going deep enough, pathetic little scratches. Why can't you feel more pain? Why can't you cut deeper?   
*You fail at even the simplest things*.  
You cut more. Faster, harder. You want centimetres, not millimetres.  
But still the same depth, still the same shit.  

There're too many cuts now. But still no pain, only numbness from the raw wounds you view.   
But the blood won't stop. Your wrists are painted. Like stained crimson cloaks wrapped around each arm.   
You slip in the dark puddle and feel the red wetness of the towel you clench.    
â€œTake me! You scream.   
â€œPlease just take me! You keep screaming at the otherworldly force.   
Pleading for the way out, pleading your heart would just stop.   
Now a mess of tears and blood on the floor, you weep.   
The sounds of silence bounces in your head.  
The dark voice is gone.   
Nothing.  

A door opens.   
The realisation of someone witnessing the mess you are in kicks you up.   
You can smell the shame from your cold sweat. You can see the damage you've caused yourself and the one who is about the enter.  

â€œI'm sorry. You whisper.   
You are numb and frozen as they wrap the bandages around your wrists.   
â€œI'm sorry.   
You can see the pain in their eyes. You can feel the fear in their trembles. You can hear the confusion in their silence.  

*You don't deserve this love*. The dark voice echoes.   
And then you fall back into the abyss.",5
"My mom is my biggest supporter but also the most sensitive and emotional person there is. When I want her to cheer me up, she starts crying too because she's so empathetic and it ends up being me who has to cheer HER up. She doesn't mean to, it just happens. I love her to death but her emotions often comes first. Which makes me not wanna talk to her about my health at all.

I turned 16 yesterday, but I feel like my life is going by way too fast. I'm gay, have no friends and all I do is lie in bed and cry. 

Because I'm gay, I'll never experience the feeling of having a teenage romance. I'll never get asked to prom. I'll never glance at a guy in my class and get a smile or a glance back. I'd say I'm fairly handsome to my knowledge and I try to care for others so it's not that I'm undateable. It's just that â€œeverybody's straight until proven gay, if you know what I mean.

I just wanna live in a world where I can ask for a guys number without him being weirded out because â€œhe's not a homo.

My life is going by way too fast. I'm afraid I'll be alone forever. I'm impatient. I know I'm only 16. But I'm already so tired of this life. I'm missing out on so much the other straight kids my age are doing. I wanna live their simple life, but obviously I can't. 

I'm just so tired of everything. I want it to end. I want to believe that I'll be reborn as a straight guy or girl. To fall in love and having a chance with them. I want to live that life. I want to live an easy life with the only struggle being that the screen on my phone has a crack. I don't believe in it, I just wish that's what happens when you die.

But I can't take my life. I could never do that to my mom. As I said: she's emotional. She would be heartbroken. She's been depressed before and I'm certain she would grow into old habits if I were to disappear. 

Sometimes I just wish she would die so I could take my life without hurting her. It's awful and I'm ashamed to be writing this. I just want everything to end. I want everything to end with my mom.

EDIT: Hey, it's me a few hours later. I almost become a different person when I have these kind of depressive episodes. Looking back at this post now, I feel bad. I now understand that what I said can come across as ignorant. Which I certainly am. I'm only 16. I have a whole life in front of me. And when I'm feeling this down, I push all positive things about my life away. I have to hold on. I have to wait. My life has barely begun.

I don't actually want my mom to die. I just wanted to disappear without leaving her behind. I'm feeling better now but I'm sure I'll come back to this post when I'm sad again. Sorry for being dramatic and all over the place. But thank you all for taking your time to read and reply to this. It helps more than you think.",4

But sometimes my mom can bug me.. like in the waiting room at the clinic while waiting to get recommended for a psychiatrist for depression she says: You still have it right?

Like what?! She has a nursing degree and asked that. I mean she's usually very supportive but just this small thing makes me very confused. I am doing much better now that I have a routine and am not alone and suicidal everyday but just because you don't see my depression doesn't mean My depression went away.

I've hid it for at least 6 years and i was very good at it. I'm an actor. But it irks me that she would say that.

I'm 19 and sorta tall sometimes when we're out shopping or something she talks about things that I'd rather not discuss in the middle of the mall, like â€œoh, yeah we should discuss when you should attend classes, and we never discuss this at home.

It feels like she's justifying my presence, like this is why I'm here with my 19 year old son on a Monday shopping and he's not in school. Honestly it's embarrassing and even if Im overthinking it I feel anxiety in public and I really don't like standing out.

I'm pretty sure my depressions from her side of the family as she and her grandmother have had antidepressants. Don't get me wrong we're close and I love her, but sometimes it's very annoying and any constructive criticism I give the way she responds is never in a way that doesn't make me feel guilty about pointing something out.

Whenever there's a problem she seems to blow it out of proportion, and I've stopped trying to help because if we go down a wrong street I become implicated in the problem and she makes it feel as if the world is ending even though everything works out. 

Sometimes it feels like she lets things go wrong on purpose, I can't even count the times we have gone out for something and she forgot her bags, or we forgot to bring some package for the post office, or something similar. Whenever this happens she says â€œoh I should have thought of that â€œI'm so stupid â€œI should have known and it makes me feel as if she is expecting me to remind her of these things. I appreciate all the things she does but if it's something she organizes for example shopping like I have no control over what she forgets to bring but she somehow makes me feel responsible, or at least I do somehow. 

I just can't understand this negative side to her and it seems like somethings always wrong and if it is she exacerbates it, I can't tell if it's from her depression if she has low self esteem and is hard on herself if she makes mistakes or makes mistakes on purpose, regardless it affects me.

I know not everything here was directly about depression but I thought because it relates to my situation might as well say what's on my mind.
Does anyone else have perspective on having depressions and living with parents? Im lucky to have supportive parents but sometimes I'm not sure how to deal.",4
"Do yall ever feel so numb and empty, but at the same time you feel so much pain and emotions ? And its so confusing but what are you gonna do about it ?  
Just last week I was feeling better, and now I'm back at the bottom

I don't understand. I have an amazing boyfriend and friends, my family is shitty but I know they do love me, I've just suffered from so much emotional trauma from them.

And I do feel happy sometimes. When I'm with my friends and boyfriend all we do is talk and laugh, but when I'm alone I feel so hopeless. Which makes me wonder if I'm actually even depressed.

It hurts, everything hurts so much.  
I just found out my, ""best friend"" who I've known for 6 years, doesn't want to be my friend anymore. Because I've been so busy with school, and I've been so stressed and just exhausted I haven't seen her in a few weeks and then I found out today from her brother.

My family is a wreck, my mom is always telling me about all her problems and I have to listen and counsel her, I'm just a teenager mom,  I wish you would take me to that doctors appointment like you promised you would so maybe I could actually get some help, instead of running off and leaving for days to God knows where.

I haven't been to church in weeks, church has always been so important to me, but lately I don't want to go, I don't want to see the people there that I've known since I was a baby. I don't want to do anything in my free time but lay on my bed.

I want to cry, I want to cry so badly but I can't. I physically cannot cry, and so I'm just here, shaking, in pain, and at the same time feeling nothing. I'm so scared, I don't want to do this anymore, I can't do it anymore I just want it all to go away. I want to go to sleep and never wake up. I wish I could be telling my friends these things, but I'm supposed to be the friend who has every thing together and helps everyone else.

I'm sorry, I needed to rant.",4
"I don't know why but, ever since the breakup with my ex 2 months ago, I've been feeling more alone, more suicidal. I was by no means not suicidal before the relationship or during the relationship but now I'm out of it, I feel cold, alone and suicidal a lot more. Something about being held and comforted by someone who I actually loved was peaceful. I'm a very heavy guy (16 stone heavy) so I've always found Bad luck in relationships. Due to this and the countless bullying I suffered due to my weight, I've been very depressed and suicidal, and when a person comes into my life, I just get attached to them easily. I just feel like I'm worthless, like I don't deserve the happiness I want to have. In times like this I just want someone to lay down with me, cuddle with me, and reassure me they won't leave me and won't hurt me. I fucking hate the way I am, I want to think normally, I want to be normal, but I can't fit in anywhere.",4
Nothing aint fun nomore nothing excites me nomore nothing to look foward to nomore life aint fun nomore so whats the point of staying?,5
"Maybe this will be the last time I'll be posting here, and allow me to express my gratitude for all of you, I have met few amazing people through here in the last year and I'm glad, that I spent the last year without the rules of the society and at my will, well worst and I don't regret a second of it. I'm glad to have had such a privileged life, ups and downs but most of it all was such a ride. I'm content, I'm not angry or upset nor feeling helpless, I'm feeling like it's time. It was a good 21 year ride, and bless the reddit for it helped me laugh countless times with the memes and helped me get in touch with myself through its amazing redditors, you all rock, hope to meet you all one day after that rainbow bridge. 
Thank you and goodbye. :)

Update: I was caught by my mom while preparing for it and she didn't need a second to release what I was about to do, I'm on surveillance now, there goes me, failed again. Nonetheless, thank you to everyone who tried to reach me and left a kind comment. Back to hell, back to reality, back to existing.",0
"I give up.Â  I have been over life since I was a teenager and I'm not doing a good enough job hiding it anymore.Â  My boss even pulled me aside with concerns.Â 


""When I was interviewing you you had the best interview I'd ever seen. Where is that guy? You miss work, you're emotional, you have lost all your passion""Â 

My mother can't even talk to me without me going into tears over being the worst son ever. She hasn't said anything to that effect but does notes that I'm not eating. Not doing anything anymore. When I'm off work I end up spending hours just staring at the walls and I'll find myself crying although I don't know what for. She doesn't visit my home as often anymore.

I feel like I'm starting to slip and it's too much. When I could hide it it was fine because I didn't have to explain anything to anyone, but having people ask me directly why I'm malnourished and lost a lot of weight is leading to outbursts I can't control anymore.Â Â 

I was keeping it together pretty well for about 30 years but in the last 2 years my entire friend groupEnded up moving away or finding their own lives all at about the same timeAnd since then I've not really had any contact With other people outside of workÂ 
. I'm glad I was able to keep it together until everyone found their own happiness so I avoided being a burden to them. so I feel like it's as good a time as any to have me just quietly disappear
Â I don't know how to tell everybody that the guy that they thought they knew was an act and never existed in the 1st place. I feel darker and darker thoughts more and more often lately and I would honestly be terrified to actually hurt somebody else. And I guess I just wish that there was some safe in easy way out of life because I don't really deserve it.Â Â 

Who could possibly go through another 30 years of this shit? How is it that I am the crazy one for not wanting that?Â 

When people have used up all they had it's less ethical to make those people stay alive than to let us go.",2
"I am a senior in high school and have been miserable for as long as I can remember. I never really got any joy out of anything. Therapy never helped and nothing I try to do works. I hate school, and I'm in an apprenticeship that my dad talked me into which I have never been into construction and now I know I absolutely hate it but my dad won't let me quit. At the same time I can't see myself having a future or being happy in the future. I would have killed myself a long time ago but my family would be sad so I'm stuck chugging along and being miserable.",2
"How do I say that I want to lay in bed all day and do nothing? How could I convey to my parents that not wanting to exist is one of few thoughts that I have? I don't want to work, but still my parents force me to, I know this might sound as if I'm lazy. And I am, no doubt in that. 

Tbh I didn't ask to be born, let alone grow up to do stuff that I'm not interested in. If I were to have my dream job, I'd work on it in my pace, but obviously that isn't how it works.

I always come to work, most of the time I'm late, 10-20 mins but I still arrive and work. 

Now I want to run away, cuz I'm tired of them complaining about how I always sleep or that I'm lazy and do nothing all day, that I'm always in my room and not check in on them. That I can't smoke weed to cope with my thoughts.

We only get one life. One. I don't want to spend that time thinking about suicide, and then complain in my head about the options and how painful or too fast it's going to be. 

I don't want to run away, but most of our time we've been together all I hear is an in depth negative comment of how my life is, and contrast to a simple ""I love you."" I do get ""how are you feeling today?"" Or ""what are you up to today?"" But I can't say anything with honesty cuz then they'll start to ask questions that I can't answer without breaking down and shit. 

I almost don't care about family and friends. But I think one fateful day, I'll make that irrational decision and run away. I really am tired of listening to the implications of how bad my life is, and I don't want to hear it anymore. I just need a little push that goes a little too far, then I'll probs snap and head the fuck out. Who knows.

I'm angry at myself and them, and honestly I want to hit stuff and scream at the top of my lungs. But I gotta keep it together, right?
One life.",2
"I've been suicidal in the past and really thought I was better. For some reason started thinking about all the bad/hurtful things I've done to people and within like a week went from feeling generally good to researching ways to kill myself. I feel like a shit person and like there's no good reason for me to live. I just want to stop feeling guilty and I don't know how to do that except kill myself. And I feel like I would kind of deserve it.

I'm scared that even if I make it through this I'm just doomed to being suicidal all my life and eventually I'll be impulsive enough to do it. Even just thinking this way makes me feel guilty because I know how much being suicidal hurts and scares my friends and family. I feel like a bad person for reaching out for help.",5

it's so hard. why can't i just have the option to disappear from the world? why can't i just die without becoming even bigger of a burden to everyone. why is it so damn fucking hard, i've tried my best...",5
"I just can't anymore, my friend that been supporting me to this very moment, she is really kind and I am sorry for what I am about to say but I just don't see the point why shouldn't I just kill myself. I am giving up I just can't bear this anymore. The pressure is too much and I am just so tired of trying over and over and over again. Whatever I do whoever I try to ask nothing will happen. I just don't really see the point why should I keep pushing and keep trying. I haven't slept in days, didn't eat or just did anything productive like homework I have to do. I just don't really see the point right now. Why? Please tell me why? Why?! Nobody cares! My family doesn't I care! I don't have any friends! I am all alone in this! Why am I the only one that suffers! I am always the blamed one! Just... WHY. Nobody can help me. 

I am all alone in this deep shit. 
I have no idea what to do next in my life. There is no point no reason nothing matters we all are going to die so why to live in the first place?

I am sorry",4
"The stability in my mental health comes and goes and right now it's particularly bad. I have suffered from mental health issues since I was a child, and it was particularly bad in my teenage years. Mental illness along with multiple suicide attempts destroyed my memory, and I feel like losing my teenage years to mental illness impaired me as an adult. 

I'm in university now, I do my work, get decent grades, but I don't know what I'm doing. I don't enjoy anything, my program is okay but I don't see my future like so many people do. I struggle to make real connections with people, I am so emotionally unavailable and have hurt so many people leading them on and being unable to commit to them. I also barely enjoy sex and am traumatized from being sexually assaulted after a graduation party. I am wasting away my young adult years now, and soon enough I'll regret not doing anything with my time. Therapy has never worked for me. I can safely say that I am a ghost of who I was, and who I could've been. I pretend and pretend but this part of me always seeps through the cracks. I want it to all end but I don't think I could ever die, I am an only child and only daughter and it would tear my family apart. I'm just stuck. I'll never be who I want to be and I feel like I have no options",1
"I know it's late, but I fell into a pool of depression and I realize it now, and I don't know how to get out . Right now its weird but I almost have this part of me wanting to stay depressed and I don't know why. Maybe you would know what I could do?",0
"I'm 49, single and still a virgin believe it or not.

Religion,  Neuroticism , introversion, possible aspergers etc. It is not a simple problem.

I'm a guy. Today is my bday.I bought a can of chlorinated brake cleaner and want to hit it with a welder. That is pretty much what they used in WWI to wipe out the trenches. You smell a fresh cut lawn and a day later you are in a great place. I don't care if I suffer a bit but it is a 100% kill rate. Every single day is suffering for me.

No, I'm not some 19 yo writing this. They have their whole life ahead of them.

Now, it is not like I went out without a fight. In the last few years I watched every self help video. Most were aimed at young guys probably.

I bought clothes.

I have cool hobbies. I work on cars. I fix houses. I like to cook.

I work out. I run and rollerblade - 25 miles is not a problem - I don't even get out of breath. I'm still skinny though and built almost like a teenager. I tried to build muscle but I can't. Men my age look ""substantial."" My neighbor is my age EASILY twice my size. I look at men and I see their wrists and bones, I'm built like a woman. There is something unfixably wrong with me.

I feel like I'm dead and invisible to women. People my age are married with kids and enjoying life. I die inside when I see couples. I missed out on so much in life.  No one even wishes me happy birthday. It is hard to understand what truly being alone is like. It is like death in a way.

I'll never have kids or a family at this point. I just don't want to be the creepy old single man.

I have a computer company and make mid 6 figures, but it brings me zero joy. I'm not trying to brag, and I know other people struggle financially and feel bad but would you want to sit ALONE in front of 4 monitors for 12 hrs a day to make this money? I don't hate the work but why do it if I have no one to share it with?? I feel so alone, like I'm working from hell. I guess people benefit from my work indirectly thru the taxes I pay and the welfare and SNAP they get.

I just need the courage to empty this can and light up the contents. I'll finally be at peace. There is nothing at this point that will make me get better.

I stopped being able to watch movies months ago. Now I'm finding myself in conversations I and I have no idea what we're talking about.

"I've been diagnosed with this and that etc but day to day I try and play devils advocate with myself because my motivation is at maximum low.

There's things I can physically literally do, like clean my room, put sheets on my bed, shower or whatever but when it comes down to it I put myself in a hole. There's times where I get so suicidal that once those thoughts pass and time heals or whatever the fuck I'm left to not give a shit about anything because in my head I should be dead and whatever good happens to me in my life in the future was luck and the rest was destined.

I'm at a point where I've seen no light at the end of the tunnel for quite a while. I've lightly thought about just ending it for some time as well. Tonight I feel it like never before.

I just want to feel okay again. I looked at some old photos today and there was one where I realized that was the last time I truly felt good.

At least I have a family, but will I just live with my mom forever? without ever having my own house, my own money, my own life?

Everything seems so uninteresting and boring. I'm just so tired of having no motivation to chase my goals. I feel like I once I had the potencial to have a good life, but somewhere on the way I lost my purpose. I'm still young but I feel like I've missed out on so much already.

I hate myself. I hate my inability to live a normal life.

Guess I'll just listen to sad music, drink alcohol, masturbate to porn, and cry myself to sleep tonight like every other day. At least I get to feel something. My mind is so broken, I'm just a piece of trash, a sad excuse for a human being.

I'm a talentless loser. Even If I wanted, I couldn't be succesful in any career or job. I'm too slow, too dumb.

This sub is nice to chat with other people in a similiar situation, but it's also just an illusion. It's not like anyone here cares about me either. Every single day I think about comitting suicide and I really feel like I'll do it in the next few days. In a way I feel kinda guilty for having those thoughts cause I really think this earth is amazing, I hate myself for wasting my life like that but I think it's the only way i'll feel at peace with myself, though I admit i'm scared of death, I'm scared of the emptiness that will come after. but I'm also scared of the emptiness I feel now, while I'm still breathing yet unable to feel true joy and enjoy it to the fullest. I guess 2019 is my last year. I'm crying as I type this, I just wish things were different, I wish I was much more than I am now. I rarely leave the house but when I do I always feel a bit sadder when I see a couple together or just a group of friends having fun. I know I'm too awkward and weird to live life like they do. I know it's pathetic, but it's just the way it is. And obviously I have big self steem issues and hate the way I look. Every time I look in the mirror I think of how ugly and disgusting I am, I actually try to avoid looking because I know I'll get depressed(more than I usually am on a regular day). I keep writing these posts on reddit because it's better to share the way I'm feeling than just rot in my room, maybe I can find some cool person to chat with and make my existence a bit less miserable? who knows. I really feel sorry for my parents, cause they have no idea how I really feel, and I just can't picture myself saying all this to them. I wish I could kill myself without making my family suffer. They don't need to just because I'm a piece of shit loser

I just can't",5
"M/16, currently going through depression and can't talk to anyone. I've been visiting a psychotherapist for about 2 years and a psychiatrist for several weeks but just decided to stop going there like 6 months ago. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety and have depression but never actually talked about that with anyone, not even with my parents or the therapists. My everyday life goes like this: wake up, survive 7 hours at school, come home, play video games for rest of the day since I don't have anything better to do, cry into sleep, repeat. In school I barely speak to anyone even though I am going in the same class for over 5 years now. Only have 1-2 friends but they mostly only see me as the last choice everytime and only want to meet up when no one else has time. Recently we got someone new in the class and it seems like he had more social contact with the everyone else in the past 3 days than me in the last 5 years. Everyone think's i am introverted and it's kinda true, but only because I get rejected by everyone I even try to talk to and get excluded from everything. When people throw parties, I never get invited but people they barely talk to get invited. My grades are horrible and I am about to get off the school and don't even know what I want to become, since i just stopped caring after I noticed that everyone ignores me and no matter how hard I try to build up a new friendship / contact, I get rejected. I am the kind of person to look at my phone and than ask someone what time it is just so I have somewhat of a social interaction lmao. My parents only see my grades but don't care about my feelings. Because of this happening over many years (basically my whole life) I began to hide behind a emotionless mask. I am not able to express my feelings. nothing. The only thing i can do is laugh (because of something funny, not because i am actually happy) or hate on something. Even if anyone would make me happy, e.g. inviting me to a party, I couldn't show it and still act bored / emotionless because I am too afraid what people would think when I suddenly change and behave like everyone else. I also don't know anymore how to feel empathy. Like i would really like to and empathize with someone but no matter how hard I try it just doesn't work. When someone is sad I can say to myself ""this person is sad"" and feel bad about it, but I cannot comprehend it. I also feel absolutely worthless. For example I don't even say hi/goodbye to most people since i think i am not worth their time. When I meet someone from school outside accidentally, I walk pass them and they walk past me just because I don't want the other person to feel awkward. I know they don't like me and their day is probably ruined just by seeing me so i don't try to force the contact. At this point in my life i noticed that people are just assholes not caring about anyone. Everyone has their perfect life and ignores me so trying further wouldn't change anything. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. In the past i began to think more often about how it would be if just killed myself. I am not really thinking about doing it, but honestly I couldn't care less if I just got hit by a but. I feel like visiting the psychiatrist / therapist wouldn't change anything since I am not being honest to them anyways and don't know how I could be. Anyone good experiences with psychiatrist? Did it help in your case?

This is a throwaway and I just needed to get this off my chest but feel free to comment, I will read it.",5
Im just so tired with life. I wanna have a day off or just maybe kill myself. I am so not seeing the good in everything rn. I have been wanting to cry for a month but I just couldn't? I am so tired. Everything's just really tiring. I just want to cry.,5
"I botched my suicide attempt, but I know where I went wrong. Since then, I've been seriously looking for good reasons to live for the last month, and I feel as useless and worthless as ever. Everyone hates me, and I am a burden at the best of times. Everyone goes out of their way to avoid me. I tell my therapist, and they just tell me not to think about it, like it's somehow a switch I can turn on and off. I've been trying to find healthier ways to cope, and have failed. Now, I've suspended my studies and live at home doing fucking nothing all day, distracting myself from thoughts of self-harming. I contact friends, and they reject and ignore me, even when I've told them all I want is to talk or do small things together. Nobody makes time for me, nobody sees any value in me, and the world would be better off without me.",5
"Supplementary information: College student, physics major; I've been dealing with systemic loneliness and depression for a number of years. And as of late, sleep has escaped me, running from my troubles through mathematical gymnastics has exhausted its use. So I ask, â€œWhat keeps your momentum on challenging days?",5
i've been going thru a pretty big rough patch i've the last month and so the small amount of time i've spent at home has been devoted to either drinking smoking or sleeping so it's become an absolute disaster. so i decided to take the next two days and devote them to cleaning up my apartment. i can't remember who commented it but i remember seeing someone saying that even just doing one load of laundry or making their bed helps them a lot. i don't post much in this sub but i sure do lurk a lot and i just wanted to thank everyone that comments and reply's to stuff. i just want to let you know that you're not only helping the person who's post you're commenting on. you can be helping countless other people like me who just sit back and read and i want to thank this whole community. i don't know if cleanings gonna help me in the long run and i know it won't fix all my problems but it's a start. and idk if whoever's reading this needs to hear it but the small things matter. even if it's picking up all your dirty clothes and putting them into the hamper. the smallest things can make a huge difference. if you're reading this i love you thank you for making this community what it is. we're gonna all get thru this one step at a time. keep your heads up.,3
"I can't do this anymore, after moving to 3 different high schools in my last year of school, two core classes of mine are failing grades (one 20 and one 55) and I don't know what to do. Walking the stage doesn't even seem appealing to me anymore. All this work I don't even understand. I should be studying instead of Reddit but I can't even talk to my girlfriend without feeling embarrassed. Idk why this is so much pressure on me, I don't even know what to do when I get out of high school. School ends in May and I just don't know. We have one quarter left of high school. 

This is too much and I'm thinking about things I shouldn't think about. But this life shit is too much and I can't handle it anymore. I really can't. I try and try but nothing clicks. I just can't Anymore and I'm tired of being an disappointment",2
"I barely knew her, but she saw me struggling and immediately came to comfort me. She wrote me on a piece of paper ways to feel better and never end up in the hospital again, along with her number if I need anything. 3 years later I want to kill myself again, I want to call her but I feel bad unloading my baggage on a random person who probably doesnt even remember I exist. I have no one else. I dont know what to do. I just cut my thighs I wanna shove the switch blade into my throat and I have no one to call besides this random girl who showed me kindness 3 years ago in a loony bin",4
We ended up arguing and he told me I was spoilt and I was being manipulative?? I started crying and kept repeating the same things over and over again. I'm so extremely embarrassed and I wish more than anything I hadn't told him. I feel stupid and pathetic because of how much I kept repeating myself...,4
"So i failed my semester again for second time.
I always was the top grades on my class till i entered college and everything just fall .
Cant focus or study till i failed for first time in my life
And thats where i became depressed.
I was always that strange kid who dont think like a kid or play like them
I was just a smart kid who cant find a meaning for anything.
I wasnt sad but not that happy too .
Even when my dad died i felt nothing even so he tried to kill me twice but still did many good things to me .
I remember i only cried a little when i saw my sis crying really hard for him.
And then i became a depressed person after first year in college .
Going to uni was a hell for me
I just wanted to be alone and sleep forever.
Till recently i found the courage inside me to change my life 
I started nofap and started praying everyday and dieting .. deleted all video games and books or films i had.
Just to change my whole life and felt really good even so i had many faild attembs but tried to improve .
Now i got my grades and failed again..
I dont want to die now .. i finally found something i rly want to do. And want to improve my life
But unfortunally thats it for me
I know my mother gonna have like a heart attack if she saw my grades.. and me myself cant just live anymore.
I had enough of these empty feelings.
Its the 27th of this month
My last day.
Till then i will continue doing my ""life changing"" daily habbits and studying more than ever for last time to prove to myself i can do it like others before suiciding.
I know my english is shit rn im not a native speaker and not emotionaly stable to focus .
Just wanted to say some of the things inside me.",2
"I hate myself so fucking much, it hurts to exist. I'm a pathetic, disgusting excuse for a person and nobody, not even me can stand being around me. I wish I could just be somebody, anybody else.",1
"I can't fucking stand looking at myself in the mirror, my face is round and my cheeks are too chubby. It's a fucking baby face and I see kids younger than me who are able to have defined jawlines, clear skin etc. But no, not me I have moderate acne and I have psoriasis which is starting to flare up. I try to look after myself, but it gets fucking hard getting out of bed and actually looking after myself when I wish that all of this would go away. 

They say I look like my Dad, as if it were a positive aspect, even though he left me when I was a baby. So what? I'm supposed to be grateful for looking like someone who not only was a deadbeat, but also that I should be grateful that I have to look bad for something I couldn't control. I just want to get plastic surgery ASAP. The only reason why I'm working so hard (or at least trying) is to get enough money to fix this shit. I feel so anxious that I feel like when people talk to me, it's out of pity. Why would you talk to someone who looks ugly? My personality doesn't match my body; I can be aspirational, confident at times (shocking right?) , and empathetic. But then I'm a 6'2, slightly chubby piece of shit and whilst that could potentially be fixed, why the fuck is it so hard for me. I swim about 1.5 - 2 miles a week and I eat okay and I can't lose weight. And if I were to get plastic surgery etc., I know that my family would disapprove it, despite that my siblings look so much better than me, seriously. It's not even my family, but my mum, how would she look at me.

But on the other hand this can't happen any longer. It's like my reputation is based on looks when I'm so much more. I want to cry but no one would care because *where's the reward when it isn't a cute ""depressed"" girl to help?* I get judged for being nice, as if I were trying to get some. Could any of you give me your thoughts on plastic surgery. It pisses me off how I would get criticised, like I'm forced to stay this way but others who are naturally fit get to have a good life. I just can't keep going on.

I remember one time I was talking to someone and felt like I wanted to cry because I was thinking ""no one would ever see me like the way they see other people "" (i.e. romantically). I wanted to die, like I always have. But I cannot for certain personal reasons. Hence I am trying to choose the other method: work really hard and if things don't change I **will kill myself regardless of my morals &amp; the consequences etc.** But please, don't comment the bullshit of ""you'll find someone who loves you for your personality"". That is pity and that fucking beats me to the ground. I had a mini panic attack but I tried to contain it to write this. Opinions would be appreciated. I just wanted to make my mum happy and I still managed to fuck it up, no stories about countless girls, popularity, just a sorry piece of shit that my mum has to love. I feel so bad for her.",1
"Today I got brave enough to tell my mom I'm not okay and that I need to go to the hospital. I told her last year that I tried to die when she found my suicide notebook and saw my SH marks on my arm. I haven't been going to school and she sees me cry almost everyday. But when I told her she said â€œwhat made you think like that and â€œyou can't think like that. I said we need to go to the hospital idk what's going to happen tonight. She said why would I go to the hospital and for what reason, like she doesn't know. I told her never mind and she just moved on like it was nothing. Like her daughter is nothing. 

I also told my dad today, but all he could ass was â€œwhy would u feel the NEED to think like that and asked me a bunch of questions as if it's my fault I'm depressed and want to die. 

My friends know that I go through depressive moods and the first time they cared but by now, they don't even bother to check up on me. 

I've been trying to get better by myself but I can't do it. I stopped SH but that doesn't make the thought go away. I'm just so tired and alone.

I wanna cry, I feel like a piece of shit, I can't do things, I feel sad, I wanna die.

I want everything to stop. To fucking stop for 1 moment.
I want to be alone for 1 day so I would do what the fuck I want. I don't want to see anybody, or to talk to anybody. I just want to be somewhere so no one could reach to talk to me. I want everything to stop. Everything is happening too fast. I feel like I don't have time for anything and I feel tired all the time.

"Very painfully (for me) over the past few months I've lost my best friend. Despite my trying to make things better I couldn't salvage things. We've gone from a really good friendship to barely talking at the end of the day, mostly because of routine. I still care about this person greatly, but its pretty clear thats not the case for this person

Over that time period, my mental state has just gone down the drain. This person was really my only reason to get out of bed in the morning, and be the best version of me that I can be.

I've gone from an A student, to a B student, to a C student, and now im having trouble bringing myself to do any schoolwork at all. I just want to lay down and sleep, even though im getting less than 5 hours a night.

I've been having suicidal thoughts for the past month and I honestly dont know how much longer I can hold out, with the lonliness and the stress given for being an academic student (Canadian system)

I've always been more of a lonely kid, but over this friendship I was shown how much greener the grass is when you have someone to talk to, someone that (seems) to enjoy your company, and can make you smile.",4

He died of natural causes in his sleep, and I just want to join him. I want to find the power to continue living but every day is a battle and I just don't know how to cope anymore. My thoughts have been getting darker and darker by the day and I'm beginning to fear myself.

My situation in life it pretty good, I know this. Objectively, I can see it but this feeling that I carry inside is too much. This echoing nothing that carries on from day to day, the overwhelming sadness, the worthlessness... its all too much.   I think about my family and then I feel guilt.. who would find me , who would clean up? Who would pack my shit away or sell it? The damage it would do to my mother only adds to the guilt.  But there's no way I can stay, living like this hurts. I'm head over heels for someone and every minute I spend with them is lovely. I makes things a little bit easier. But I can feel that my presence is too much sometimes, and the guilt come rushing in. I don't know how long I can keep this up.",5
"I've been suffering from depression and anxiety since like 8th grade. I was molested when I was younger which definitely doesn't help but honestly I just wanna kill myself cause of my current situation. I just feel so lonely and just downright defeated honestly. I thought I've been getting better but realized that I'm actually just regressing in different ways. Instead of being sad about my problems I laugh them off and ignore them leaving them there, instead of being too open with my friends driving them away I now have serious problems not being able to express that I care about people. It's to the point that apparently (someone else pointed this out) I physically shake when I begin talking about anything wrong with myself. I'm so fucking sick of this you'd think of after 4 YEARS of consistently fighting and trying everything (medicine, mediation, therapy) NOTHING has been accomplished. I always feel like an outsider looking in, never really belonging. Sometimes I think my friends secretly don't like me and I don't blame them. How could you like someone who can't express that they care about you. Never been in an actual relationship, to the point to where when my entire workplace realized I probably wasn't going to prom so my friend volunteered to go with me which to me feels like a complete pity act as she does have a boyfriend.

Wage slavery at the bottom of the totem pole for another 30 years, no forms or loved ones outside my immediate family, no accomplishments or achievements. Just the long, slow decline into a sad, lonely old age, followed by a meaningless, protracted, lonely  senescence. No one will care for me as an old man, because I'm incapable of caring for people now. I'm doomed to mediocrity and loneliness. Nothing can keep it from happening except ending it all before it gets to that point. I keep thinking â€˜Well, I could try and off myself, that would keep things interesting and I could put off that fate for just a little longer.' But no. Eventually I'll settle down into a meaningless, soul sucking job, just like everyone else, and wait patiently for death like a good boy.",5

"A month ago I was feeling suicidal. During that period I had a conversation with my son's 16 year old cousin from his mom's side of the family. During our conversation he mentioned to me how much he cares and looks up to me and how I was the only adult he could talk to about girls, his problems, and guitars (shit all teenage boys like to talk about). After our conversation I started thinking about what he said and about all the people in my life that care/depend on me (my son, parents, friends, etc.). And for some reason it seemed like more of a reason to kill myself. I found comfort in knowing that if I killed myself I would be missed. I knew they would be sad for awhile but eventually they would move on and think about all the good times we had. I liked knowing that despite my decision I would die knowing I had an impact on someones life.

I feel as if nobody cares about me, and that life will never get better at all. I've never had anybody i'd consider a true friend really my entire life and now i'm 20, it's starting to really hurt. My social circle consists of two people, to which i'm sure they can't stand me. They're always making stupid jokes and putting me down, but - shit, they're the closest people I have to real friends, and the only people I talk to on a daily basis. I'm at rock bottom right now. Every single friendship I've ever tried to make has just turned people away from me, like i'm some monster. I don't even feel human anymore. I don't feel like I fit in anywhere. I need help.

She is the only woman who would agree to marry me because I'm fat and gross and have no money and the only reason she has stayed is because she knows she can treat my like shit and I wont leave.

"I... I can't imagine dying, it's not something that I want.

And yet these thoughts they still exist and seem to scare and creep and haunt.

Plenty of ways to go about it, some are easy, some are not.

I let the feelings fill me up till I become too deep in thought.





I'm standing on a bridge, I'm looking down at frigid water.

I have come here with a thought, and intentions of self-slaughter.

But when I stand up on the railing, I want someone to come,

Someone to shout and pull me down, stop me from doing something dumb.





I want a stranger's embrace, to reassure me it's okay.

To tell me that it isn't worth it, that the trip's only one-way

I want to bawl and breakdown, in the arms of the unknown.

So I can maybe feel cared about, and not feel so alone...





Now I'm in my room, with a note and rope in hand.

Thinking I'll finally fall through, let my thoughts and mind disband.

But when I step off of that stool, I want my mom to come rush down,

To pull me out my quiet guillotine, and stop my silent drown.





Oh, she'd probably hug and sob, knowing what I had tried to do.

Glad she ran down stairs to check on me, as if had been on cue.

That night would stay with her forever, make her always high alert,

To stop her child from disappearing, or end up permanently hurt.






However in both situations, I would simply end up dead.

That is, if I could follow through with all these thoughts that haunt my head.

Alas I am not suicidal, just a faking wannabee,

Cause I don't actually want to die, I just want someone to save me...",5
"I'm 9 years post the hospitalizations/drug guinea pig era and all the bullshit that comes from not having enough money or insurance to afford professionals that won't prescribe you Jesus or tell you withdrawals don't exist and it's purely psychological. Like, to summarize. I'm 24 now and have managed a normal and social life at school and my restaurant jobs when almost 10 years ago just the thought of leaving my house would give me severe panic attacks. Took a long ass time to fix. I got fit and cute and all that and did the [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) things and socialized with errybody like I learned on the internet and stuff.

A year and a half ago my father suddenly gave me a deadline to leave our apartment. Then pushed it earlier and changed the locks while I was crashing somewhere else. He eventually confessed he's uncomfortable having me in his home because of what I went through and just can't have me around anymore. It's insanely fucked up to have that thrown in your face and then some. ""Our"" became his and everything else his wife's.

When I became homeless periodically this past year, none of my friends or family and family friends helped me when I asked or begged. My relatives cut contact again and most of my friends and people I knew never got back to me while others awkwardly explained how we can't be friends anymore. Even people who knew me personally and what I had gone through just stopped responding to me. In person it was this strange distance from them like I'm a stranger to them. I guess reality started unfolding when things got real. You see your true friends when your heart really needs them.

Unfortunately I had a mental break at work during all this and panicked the fuck out into a depression storm and smashed a glass to use on myself in the back of my restaurant. Everyone was supportive that night and my manager got me in contact with the company's employee support fund stuff to put together money for a deposit for a place and anxiety accommodations at work. The next shifts everybody working there behaved as if I wasn't in the same room and would avoid interacting with me. I was fired a few days later and HR did absolutely nothing. I loved that place and made good money but fucked it up in a snap.

I've been homeless on and off and I couldn't get into any shelters with welfare vouchers or go on SNAP/Section 8, etc because I'm one of those DACA people. The good shelters were always full and the social workers would tell me if I know somewhere I can sleep safe, it's better to do that than the overpopulated homeless shelters here in the NY/NJ metro area. So I'd hide in people's backyards and in abandoned buildings in richer towns at night and hang around parks/libraries during the day. My dad offered to pay rent for my own place for now after he found me sleeping in his garage in 15 degree weather thank fuck for that.

Dozens of online job apps and irl job apps done and still nothing. Then the thoughts come over and over and I don't know what to do. Prozac makes me act on the thoughts while no prozac makes me tolerate them in a panic. I stay off it and just tolerate panicking and crying it away. I can't afford school and my own place while working full-time and don't have enough money to renew my DACA. Future is fucked up. The one support I got doesn't wanna talk to me and pays to keep me away. Oof. My mind calmed down after turning this into a vent..  


TL;DR: Went from mental health recovery and becoming a new person to homeless hot mess without access to welfare or family support.",2
"I come from and live in a country where things are too hard and over half the population is unemployed and suffering mentally. The only people surviving are doing something illegal like pulling the most scams, kidnapping or prostitution. I wish I can indulge in any of this, I have tried to do everything legally even with a degree i seem not to find a job.

It is too hard for me to live on, I can't afford basic meal or rent and this hardship has set even my family apart.

I am thinking of taking my life as the problem persist. See you guys on the other side if ever succeed.",2
"Hi! I've been battling depression for the past two years, officially diagnosed in summer 2019, currently on medication &amp; therapy. Beating myself up every. single. day. for just being ""lazy"", and ""not being able to get it together"", as well as struggling with the thought that i somehow just tricked everybody (including the doctors) into thinking that i have depression when really i dont. ðŸ¥´  
Anyways, after another horrifying therapy session of me complaining that i am really just a piece of shit that only wants to sleep 24/7, wasting her life away not accomplishing anything, my therapist urged me to list all the things which i do DO and sort of look at them from afar and try to practice gratitude and appreciation. Here it is:

1) most days, I am able to make myself brush my teeth and on the good days even take a shower  
2) i could have given up on all work  to kind of ""sleep through"" my depression (my partner can support me financially with no trouble) however as tempting as it is I still do the work (working remotely from home) and recently took on a big project, which I was debating declining but still didn't (no idea how and if  im going to handle it but ill update you on here)  
3) roughly once a week I may feel like putting on makeup and doing my nails  
4) i am able to socialize with my best friend and truly enjoy our evenings together, which is a huge one  
5) i am now able to recognise that the meds do really help and I stopped having hysterical breakdowns and intrusive, disturbing thoughts  
6) i have never missed a day of therapy  
7) even though my sleep schedule is non-existence (sleeping every 4 hours during the course of a day) I still pull myself out of bed, have breakfast, maybe out on some clothes and go out to work in a cafe, even if for just an hour

I think that's about it. I do feel better. Will update on my progress.",5
"I feel as if people are ignoring me and what I say now. Some of my friends have become really popular and whenever I say hi or call their name they either look at me like they don't know me or just flat out disregard that I'm even talking to them. Barely a few friends have stuck with me at this point. My crush has seen me at my desk when I'm going through a rough time but she just ignores me.  She has talked to me frequently but it just seems that she doesn't care. One of my friends who I thought was my friend leaked out that I'm autistic and have ADHD as well as I take medications for that every day. Now, whenever I walk around school people look at me and laugh while talking shit about me. Some have called me a freak and leave the school and go to a mental asylum. I've been called a mistake so many times. All this has been affecting me emotionally and physically. This has been making my depression worse and has increased my levels of anxiety. I've been having more anxiety attacks since this all started. Everything around me is starting to become meaningless to me. Nothing other than my mom, my dog, and my little brother give me a genuine source of happiness. The people at my school have made me feel even more worthless than I was before this. I want to feel accepted by someone other than my family. (I consider my friends family as well) People who don't talk shit about me or don't look at me strangely just disregard I'm there. Maybe their all right, maybe I really am just a mistake. ",4
"First of all, some details about me. I am 25 years old male in my last semester of college (yaaay!) and I call myself protypal geek - introverted IT guy who loves fantasy and Sci-fi. I am from a small European country. 

I am struggling with a feeling I can't quite name. Most of the time I feel incomplete, like some vital piece of me is missing. This feeling goes away and the world turns brighter the minute I start feeling attracted to someone. Just the possibility of having a girlfriend makes me happy, that feeling of hope. And the minute I lose that hope.. well.. hello darkness my old friend.

I've read the usual advice ""you need to be complete by yourself, find a new hobby or something that makes you happy"". I've tried, really tried. It's possible to silence it, but not remove it. When I focus on work, or on a game, a book, anything I need to put my mind on, it goes away. Unless I have a really bad day, then I need to drill through it if I want to get something done.

It kinda sounds like depression triggered by loneliness, is something like that even possible? It also have pretty firm grasp on my life, on my actions to be precise. I am driven to look for at least that hope. I am currently trying to expand my social circle. I found out that there is a pretty big fantasy/LARP community in our country. Problem is that I am going in with finding a girlfriend as my main goal. Yeah I will probably have lots of fun, but that's secondary. Rationally it sounds pretty bonkers.

One last thing I should probably mention is that I had girlfriends in the past, but with big pauses between them. The shortest pause was half a year but a standard pause is around two years which is also for how long I am alone now. One of my theories is that all this is happening because I am operating in scarcity mindset. 

I am looking for someone who can relate, maybe even help me put a name on it. I want to understand it.",5
"I'm a college student who has suffered with depression my entire life. Through multiple suites attempts, anxiety, and always despising every last thing about myself, I've decided I've reached the breaking point. My orients don't believe mental illness is real.

I've been referred to places that all require insurance, but I only have my parents who will not allow me treatment. I know I need help. I'm going to die soon, I've broken relationships and I'm unhealthier than I've ever been. I feel alone and afraid. I want to die so bad but I'm so afraid and I just need someone to help me.

"Please ignore my grammatical errors
 And thank you if you are reading this 

So the thing is I am trying so hard to be happy and ignore the toxic people in life but the thing is I don't have friends, not a girlfriend. This is eating me inside making me awkward around people which gives the weird vibe around people. I am anxious around people which make me a different human which make more difficult to make friends.  

There were some people in my life which I thought would stay around me so I ignored toxicity and thought it will become better but it backfired me because when I tried to talk to them about what they have done to me they turned the table around me and blamed me for all. Now I don't know how to make myself innocent and they have played with my emotions and I want to prove myself and want pay for there deeds 

I am trying so hard to don't give a f*ck but overthinking is killing me and I am losing all my self-confidence and self-respect.",4

"Preface, I'm a bit drunk rn, it helps numb this pain.

A girl I knew and I had hooked up with in the past, then became friends with commit suicide recently. We weren't close but I'd consider her a special friend to me. We rarely saw each other, but when we did we had the best banter known to man.  


I'm doing great in school, have a girlfriend, got internships lined up and was happy before this. But now, since she commit suicide, the only thing that makes sense to me is to kill myself. I've had depressive episodes before but this feels different. Everytime my thoughts are blank or I zone out, my first thought is the fact she is actually gone. Last time I tried to commit suicide was 5 years ago, and even then it wasn't this impactful.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason this girl's suicide has really fucked with me and makes me feel like suicide is a reasonable option. It makes me feel like I have a new purpose. I feel like there is something extraordinary waiting for me. I almost feel as if she is waiting for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I got home in a cab and cried the entire way. The cab driver said nothing. I said nothing. When he looked at me I felt he had accepted my fate as I had. Perhaps there is more, perhaps there isn't. But I do want to cry more, but I'm not close enough to the girl to deserve pity.

&amp;#x200B;

As I am typing this out I feel better.  I feel as if I do not need to die right now but I do crave death. Just not at my hand. I accept being murdered, I accept an accident.

I just wish it was over.",4

And I took three bad grades(3 Fs), lower than I ever took, and my parents don't believe me with anything and screaming and threatening me ...

No matter how some people would try to help me...

I wanted to study, but it seems like fate didn't want to keep up with me.I had a big dream , and I failed...
All in all, I'm a failure....

"For the last 7 years ive had horrible stomach problems, i throw up atleast 4 days every week, i feel nauseous constantly, i have a ton of pain in my stomach, and after all these years ive gotten so malnourished and worn out that every part of my body is in pain. Ive seen numerous Gi specialists who have all told me that im in perfect health, despite their best efforts nothing they have tried has ever worked. The last specialist i saw basically told me that everything had been tried and there was nothing left for him to do, he gave me a few meds to try but they didnt help at all. Ive been seeking help with my mental health for over 5 years but in the end everyone ive seen has either dismissed me immediately or kicked me out after a year of not helping. The last time i tried to get help i ended up getting seen for maybe 5 minutes then told i had mild depression and given a recommendation to take back to my GP. The final nail in the coffin was yesterday when i went to see an ENT after over a year of waiting, ive had what i thought was sinusitis but just like every other doctor he told me i was perfectly healthy and that he couldnt help me. Honestly the ""sinus infection"" was the one thing i thought i actually understood but now that even that isnt real my mind just feels shattered. I thought i could atleast make it through the year, hopefully see another specialist and try even more tests but now i just cant see the point. All its going to bring is more frustration and depression, i feel like i should just do everyone a favor and kill myself. Everyone would be much better off without a piece of shit like me around, i know my parents would be upset for a while but in the end they would be far more happy if i was gone.

"(Disclaimer that I get suicidal ideation in a more ongoing ""casual"" form, so might not resonate with everyone.)

What I would give for someone to say, ""I understand you're struggling, and I will understand if you choose to end it.""

Even my friends who get suicidal ideation come from a perspective of it being something you'll get through. They talk about how meds have helped them. Or about how they've become more resilient. And they'll say they'll help and encourage you the whole way.

But I don't want someone to encourage me. I want someone to sit with me and say, ""Yeah that really sucks."" To say, ""It's okay if you can't handle it."" Or even, ""I'll help you end the pain.""

I wouldn't do anything, would never take them up on it. But it would be so incredibly validating. 

I want to be heard; I want to be understood. I'm on meds, I'm in therapy, I'm resilient. I know I'm doing all the right things. Just please stop telling me I'm going to be okay, and listen to me when I say I'm not.",5
"On paper things should seem fine, the few people I've told I want to kill myself on a constant basis brush it off as me being hyperbolic or something. I think about suicide every day and I have for a very long time. Every day is just a physical underlying pain, that I can't really pinpoint.  I just want it to stop. The depression or whatever, doesn't ever go away, no matter if I change my work, have money or dont, with or without romantic partners, or how my social life is doing. I can't seem to dig out any actual real trauma. I just want to die, and I think about it all of the time, but I'm just too much of a coward to go through with it, so far. I just want help to end this.",3

"This morning my mom took me to a psychiatrist appointment I've been waiting for for months. Immediately, he began questioning why I was there when I had good grades in school and seemed fine. Also asked if I was restless all the time and I said yes, and he told me no I wasn't because I wasn't fidgeting at that point (even though I was shaking and playing with my Kleenex) Then my mom mentioned the eating disorder clinic I've been going to and he asked my bmi and I'm not allowed to know it, so he made me stand up and started patting me down to get a â€œfeel for my weight. By this point I was crying and he just continued to make me feel like I was faking it or shouldn't be there. It took me 6 years to speak up about this and now I'm regretting it because I always feared I would be told that I was overreacting or faking it. Was uncomfortable the whole time too because he was sitting with like less than a metre between us and. I have to go see him again in a few weeks and I'm so terrified, I'm still crying and it's been 3 hours. I'm sure this isn't most psychiatrists, so I don't want to scare others away from help, but I just wanted to talk about my experience and get it off my chest.",3

"I reached out yesterday... I called 111. I needed to. But now, am I glad I did or do I regret it?

 Depression at varying degrees has been my state of existence for so long, I don't know who I am without it. Yes, I have good times that are not as bad... But they are short-lived. Fleeting.

I last had medical help a few years ago. Therapy and meds helped. Therapy ended... Then I missed an appointment for a med check and I don't reschedule when that happens... I don't want to waste anyone's time.

My state was tolerable. Manageable. I stopped self harming more than a year and a half ago. I'm proud of that, even if that long stretch came from a bad relapse... I don't want to ruin it now. I really don't.

The thing is, my mental state has been deteriorating over the past few months... Year? More? I don't even know... Occasional thoughts of hurting myself I can ignore and move on from. But they, like the happy times, are usually fleeting. As are worse thoughts. Now... It's persistent. And fighting it is exhausting. Reached a point yesterday where I honestly did not feel safe. So I called. 111 put me onto the rapid response team. Had a meeting today. Have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Have to see them ever day for a little under two weeks.

But that doesn't stop the thoughts... I feel guilty because I feel like I'm taking valuable resources away from someone else who needs them. But I'm also worried... I lose chunks of time... My memory is crap and I can forget things minutes later sometimes (it's intermittent)... I have no energy or drive to do... Anything...

And I'm constantly fighting the need to do... Something. I need to hurt. But I can't let myself. And it's exhausting.

So all these strategies coming in and I keep asking myself... I don't even want help. Or do I? I don't know. I know I reached out and I know I can't keep doing this without professional help. My SO also can't keep up with this... He isn't a professional and it's so unfair to him. I want to be better for him as well as... I just want to be normal... To function. But all this outside help. It feels like too much, too fast... It would be easier to just... Not... To continue to exist and let whatever will happen just happen...",3

I've been in and out of various treatments since then. Lost my job and most of my friends. Buried in medical debt. Lost my car today.

I was struggling even when things were going well, but now I'm out of straws to grasp at. I don't like myself. I don't even respect myself. I'm embarrassed of the life I've lived. I can't keep myself sober, and, frankly, I'm out of reasons to bother trying.

"(25M) I've been dealing with depression since I was about 14. I've been to countless therapists/doctors and have never had any relief. Throughout that time I've battled the urge to end my life and the only thing that seems to stop me is the guilt of hurting my family, in particular my mum.

I feel like such an ungrateful piece of garbage for what I've put her though and I know she deserves better than me.

She unfortunately isn't the only one. I recently ended it with my girlfriend because I couldn't stand what I was doing to her emotionally, the burden of having to deal with me day after day is exhausting and its simply not fair to ask that of her.

I've had gfs in the past but she is the only one I've ever truly loved, I genuinely believe that she is/was the one, but I can't condemn her to a life with me.
She simply deserves better. She's the most wonderful person I've ever known, and she should be with someone who can make her happy.

I wish she hated me, so that she doesn't feel guilt or sadness when I die.

"Hi, so my friend has depression and an eating disorder of some kind. I had depression last year but got out of it and last time I selfharmed was maybe 6 months ago. I and the few people that know about her problems have tried to help her and it helped a little but got bad again. She was one of my bestfriends but she makes me depressed and anxious now and I can't handel it. But none of the people that she has told can really help her anymore because we are too exhausted and can't risk our own health. She won't get professional help and 70% of what she talks about is her bad eating habits or selfharm/depression.

She's always too close to me and I have said to her that I need my personal space but she doesn't seem to understand. I want to help her but It's just too much right now. When we talked about her needing professional help she said that she got professional help but it got too busy just before she could get better. She ment me, I was the professional help. I have been busy so I haven't talked to her outside of school that much and I just feel like she tried to make me feel bad that she almost got better and then I got busy. Like I can't use all my free time on you, I have my own problems and life too. She doesn't respect my boundaries and I feel like she has gotten between me and my bestfriends. I feel like I'm a bad friend but I have to choose my health first. I need some space from her but I can't get any. I need advice! But remember, if you are depressed please get help and talk to someone, it truly helps. This is why professional help is so good, friends can help to some extent but they aren't professionals that know how to handel these things in the best way. I just have it hard because I'm still healing and it's not good for me right now personally.

Sorry for bad grammar",5
"To everyone out there, the people who have suffered from depression, perhaps for many years. This is my first post, I am, like so many of you lying in bed, have been for many months, known this state for decades.

You are not alone. And whoever you believe yourself to be right now that is not true. remember the person you were when you were fine, happy, in a better place. Feel it, embody that. I know that I am holding on to it. And if life has been mostly dark it helps to believe that experiences of happiness and joy exist somewhere outside of this state...just like Martin Luther king believed in his dreams even at that particular time it seemed impossible.

I do not know what caused you to land hard in this state, for me it was relationship loss, failure, deep loneliness and isolation-I have no family and lost my relationship/friendships to depression- people left-, though life circumstances (financial issues/living environment and of course the abusive childhood) AND my reactions to them e.g. blaming myself, self-sabotage, feeling futile, discouraged, bad habits, unhelpful implicit relational and emotional patterns that keep repeating. Whatever it is that led into this black hole. I guess the situation gets more frustrating with every attempt to heal that did not work. I tried many medications (almost all of them), several psychiatric stays, several years of therapy (CBT, depth psychology), the Hoffmann process, all kinds of meditations, body work, â€œgiving up and surrender, Eckhart tolle etc you name it.. they all helped a little but nothing really worked in the long term.

And it sucks that nothing seem to work permanently. 

However, I deeply believe that there is meaning imprinted in everyone's heart. What is your life worth living? What would you like to experience?  If you we're dying what really matters to you?Lying in bed, can you imagine and feel experiencing it? The happiness, the joy, whatever it is you wish for? In every ayahuasca experience and every other methods that helped me temporary what really helped was seeing clearly this pattern of depression replaying (the thoughts, the emotional pain, the energetic pattern) and then break free of it for a while until familiar patterns re-emerge. It is like getting on a diet and putting on weight again... rebuilding relationships is a huge part of my recovery. So I guess I wanted to reach out to you and ask the question what dreams do you have today? How can you believe in them in your head first and in your body? Often the despair is exactly next to this dream. But keep building that belief. You are not alone, please do not give up. I will not either.",0
"I've been realizing some damn hard truths about myself. I've never been happy, ever since I was a little kid I felt like I was ""bad"". You know how children play ""house"" and it can be used in therapy to evaluate their outlook and issues? When I was a kid, I would play ""house"" with my fingers: there was the mom, dad, brother, and sister (me, the pinky finger). Each time, everyone would gang up on and beat up the sister. I just remembered that I used to ""play"" that game the other day - I don't think I have any real excuse for that, I was anxious as hell from a young age and irritable as fuck, but what kind of kid thinks of that shit? I was messed up back then.


I've talked to professionals. They seem to think that this is more than anxiety and depression. They say that I've faced a lot of trauma in my life. I suppose it makes sense. My parents were heavily abused during their childhoods, my mom even tried to kill herself as a young kid. My dad was an abusive alcoholic for most of my childhood. He and my mom would fight a lot - they would swear at each other, he would hit and throw things at her, she would scream at him and they would usually tell each other to go to Hell or drop dead. My dad was verbally abusive, and I remember he would hit my brother too. I presume he hit me, but I don't remember. All I remember is that when I was a teenager, he got so angry at me that he held me down on the couch. I was so detached, all I thought was how he was so angry he was about to drool on me, and how it was gross. I love my parents, despite their flaws. I just don't like them. We fight all the time. When I was younger, I remember that often when I got into a row with one parent, the other would get involved and then they would fight with each other. They would say horrible things like what I said above. They would say awful things to me too, like how once I was mad and my mom said I should look in the mirror to see how ugly I look. She would tell me to ""get out of her sight"" a lot. I get called a bitch at times. I'm told I treat them horrible, and I hate myself even more when they say that. Ugh. On the note of trauma, I realized earlier this year that I was repeatedly raped (oral, not vaginal) by my ex over the course of a year or so. That's also been tough to process.

It's fucked because I know my parents love me. They read to me as a child, they taught me to be independent. They just want me to be happy. But there's just always been something missing, I guess.

I realized that I may be in a chronic state of mild dissociation. I often feel detached from my body, my emotions, my environment, other people. I feel like I'm in a fog. My limbs aren't quite attached to my body, I feel floaty or dizzy. Weak and shaky. At times I dissociate harder, and I go totally numb. Can't move. Can't talk. Things look smaller, I float above or behind my body. My vision gets weird. It's scary yet comfortable because I'm aware that I'm further detached from myself and in a limbo for an hour. It fades and I get a headache, my body hurts, and I'm exhausted. Then it's back to reality, and I feel even more off for the rest of the day. I've noticed I also mildly dissociate when I try to sleep. My head is disconnected from my body, my limbs feel large or disconnect from my body. It's incredibly disturbing and I don't know why it happens. I never even realized I apparently dissociate until I started thinking about my childhood. Experienced some crazy depersonalization and derealization. When it happened, I realized that it was *very* familiar and I remembered doing it a lot as a kid. That realization fucked me up.


What really makes me feel crazy is the apparent somatic symptoms. I developed chronic visual snow and headaches as a teenager. I also started getting ocular migraines. Numerous tests and exams showed that all is well - it's just stress. My mouth has been hurting for the past year, as well. I even got an extra wisdom tooth removed, thinking that was the source of the pain. Nope. The pain persists, and is very noticeable when I'm stressed. Xrays and exams show that things are fine. I feel like a damn hypochondriac or like I'm malingering...but this is all very real to me.


I feel weak a lot. I am also dizzy, or like my brain is rotting, or stuffed with cotton/fog. My head is never ""clear"". I can't focus on much. Working is difficult. I can't truly interact with friends or family anymore. My weight has been all over. Due to horrible anxiety, I had lost a third of my body weight in 9 months. When I fell into this double depression, I lost 14 pounds in 2 weeks. Then someone I care about confronted me about the seriousness of it all. I tried to maintain my weight, and it worked for a month. Then I had a little breakdown and lost 7 pounds in 5 days. Started an antidepressant and became apathetic as hell - had an aborted suicide attempt and binge ate like crazy even though I wasn't hungry. I was like ""fuck it I deserve to gain weight and look disgusting"". I've gained 10 pounds in a week. I hate myself so much.


The more I realize, the more I hate myself. I've tried six or seven antidepressants, I've tried therapy a few times and am trying again. On another med right now. It all feels so damn hopeless. I've wanted to die since I was 13, and every day is just full of more pain and despair. 


People tell me not to give up on myself, but it gets more and more tempting as time goes on. Ever since I was 15, I always had a strong feeling I would die by suicide. I figured I wouldn't kill myself until I was 27 or 28, but things are becoming more disasterous. I just wish I had the courage to end this suffering soon. I feel like such a disgusting coward and a fraud. I'm ashamed to exist, to take up space in this world.",3
"Hi

I'm going to be seeing a therapist for the first time in a while, at the urging of my partner. For a long time, I've felt like my problems did not warrant a therapy session, so I am just now taking my situation more seriously. I can't continue on like this and I know it. so I'm going.

My problem is that I have minimal insurance (500$ for the year for mental health). My new therapist works on a sliding scale, but I don't know how much to pay. She's given me 100$ as an option, then I got overwhelmed and she told me to think about what I thought was fair. I might be able to get on my partner's insurance at some point, but I have no idea when,

I'm now terrified of not being able to afford therapy, because I can feel myself getting close to a breaking point.

Now it just makes me feel so alone. I can be talking and bubbly and I mention an interest and the person i'm talking to just nods in feign interest. If its over text its just stuff like ""wow"",  ""nice"",  ""lol"",  ""cool"". You can just tell they arent interested because as soon as the topic changes they are so much more involved. Honestly its making me feel so bitter, it feels like no one cares enough to try and get involved with the interests which mean the most to me. I can be surrounded by people but I feel so alone because I know no one cares. I know no one cares about me. No one cares about my interests. Honestly its just gotten really sad.

"21. University student. Stressed to the max with zero support system whatsoever. I was homeless before college (and in college) and moved across the country right after high school, cutting off contact with my abusive family. Been suicidal most of the time since being in college and in high school but still here. Came out and got a girlfriend, still nothing got better. We were homeless together for a while and experienced a lot together, been with each other for over two years. She's an alcoholic though and because it's a progressive disease things got worse over time and began to hit a low October/November 2019. Anyone who's got experience with an alcoholic loved one knows how awful it gets. I never thought things could get so much worse, but then I never thought I'd be a suicidally depressed 21 year old and I also never thought I'd date an alcoholic. It has a way of destroying your soul unlike anything else you'll ever experience, and I've been abused since I was an infant. I put aside my own sense of self, my own needs and well being to focus on hers while my heart got ripped out, stomped on, and spat on repeatedly.

My girlfriend started her journey with sobriety two weeks ago (at least I believe, don't know what to really think these days) and it feels like while she's making leaps and bounds with things I begged her to do for months I'm stuck behind and can't get my mind out of the gutter from when things were really, really bad. I know things take time but I'm tired of waiting for when life gets â€œgood. I used to think happiness was a personal choice and I still believe that a little bit, but with all the garbage I've experienced in my 21 years I'm mostly just of the opinion that some of us are dealt horrible hands in life and doomed from the start. While I â€œhave people in my life who care about me I will never have the kind of person who cares about and supports others to the extent that I do. And maybe that's a good thing, because doing so has made me lose everything about myself. But now my glass is empty and there's nothing to pour into it. I'm tired of struggling every day. Suicide seems like the only way off this terrible ride for me and it has felt that way for years.",4
I feel like life is too hard but I' not sure whether to kill myself. I've been to a mental hospital for appointments and medication but I want to be sectioned instead of forced to live in the normal everyday life that everyone else is living. Anyone know how I can get in?,3
"I just finished half of my current career... Pretty much four semesters, and almost nothing has changed.

Being honest, I've been trying to hold on for three and a half years after that Asperger misdiagnosis, but eventually it becomes unbearable... I keep thinking that some people treat me in a more child like way, or as if I were disabled, or just talking to me when we are face or face or for college stuff, but no more than that.

My mom has been trying to understand, but she says it's difficult, because she's a more self sufficient person, and she doesn't understand why I'm so obsessed with friendship.

Now I'll go to my psychologist in a few days, and I don't know how to make her understand as well... Sometimes, I think my problem isn't something that can be fixed by just believing in myself.

It's the main reason I want to die, it's the main reason I lost a lot of things and people in these past years... It destroyed my life, and I don't know how to make my mom and psychologist understand that.

I don't think I'll be able to withstand that forever. For now I can, but I feel that if the future will be the same, eventually I'll break down or have a nervous breakdown...

Believe me, it hurts to realize everything you lost, I know, it was my fault for saying it, I didn't know the consequences it would bring...

I'm tired of feeling like this, not being able to say what I really want to say to others, feeling treated like a child, trying to explain and almost no one understands... I'm not saying this because I want to bother people or to complain about life, I'm saying this because I feel like I'm very stunted compared to other people around my age, because they may think I'm a weirdo...",2

"Hey everyone,

I have a friend who lost her brother to suicide before Thanksgiving.

She's been having bouts of depression, and I want to know how I can help her. Our work therapy hasn't helped her at all by dismissing her after 3 sessions by assuming she ""seems fine."" She has taken the first step by opening up to me.

Thank you in advance to those who take the time to help.",4

"Talked to my mom today about a test I have today that I was stressing over. And the conversation turned into me wasting my potential (all in love). But what pisses me off is this just ""get over it"" mentality like what's taking me so long. And her and I both know I have to get on top of things but when you had depression for 8 years and counting this is not something you just overcome in a short period of time.

And probably what pisses me off the most is the fact she's right bc her and I both know time doesn't wait for anyone. I don't have the luxury to keep performing at the level I'm currently am.

All of this is just frustrating, ik the answer it's just a matter of applying myself.",2

"I've kind of resigned myself to the fact that I'm never going to be comfortable and satisfied with who I am because of how other people view me. My solutions to this are to just close myself off from people in general and accept my depression. Is accepting your depression bad? I've tried therapy and drugs, they didn't work and I've found that I prefer myself unmedicated anyway. I've just accepted it as part of me, it's who I am.

I don't know if it's linked to depression, because I've only been really depressed for about 8 months but had mild depression for about 3 years. I remember always having this phenomenon. It's so noticeable too, like if I fake being sick to stay home, the second I know I'm able to my mind and body just become instantly awake.",3
"Everything I've had in life has slowly been ruined by anxiety.  


Friends I used to talk with constantly are now either gone or distant because I just can't keep up with them anymore. I've separated from so much of my family because of my own choices and shitty habits. I'm unable to beat them. For years I've wanted to reconnect with the people I shut out, but I've become trapped in a self-destructive cycle where I'm too ashamed to admit my problems to the same people I just want to make proud.  


I've lost every job the same way. Whether it's throwing up in the bathrooms at work or failing to muster up the courage to even call in sick, it finds its place in the worst possible ways without fail.  
It's been like this for years. I live at home with no job, no car, not even highschool degree four years after I should have graduated. I don't even have a driver's licence.   
I've been hospitalized twice, both times in relation to this problem that just won't go away. Nothing works.

"You claw your way up and then life throws you back down.

You're just fucking expected to keep your head fucking down and keep pushing fucking anyways. Even if you keep getting kicked whole your down. Nope, not allowed to make others pay, you're just supposed to up and move on from it. It's fucked. It's completely fucked. 

At this point I just want to get ahead and I'm starting to think the best way to do that is to step all over people and completely exploit them for my own benefit. I don't have a reason to give a fuck about them anymore. It's all bullshit anyways though. I'm just done with this life. I'm sick of fucking getting up and moving.

For those of you who monitor these posts to give advice, I'd really appreciate some right about now. I just don't know how to control these urges anymore. 

I have a bad tendency to use alcohol to numb these feelings and thoughts. I know it's not a good method. But it's one that's worked for me in the past.

What has worked for you in the past? How do you feel better when you've been beaten into submission again? What do you do? How do you distract yourself? How do you avoid these dark tendencies?

I'm just so afraid of falling back into the hole of depression. I thought I had escaped it, but like always, it has a magnificent ability to be able to drag me back down.

Please. I'd appreciate any positive feedback the community has. I'm just so tired of feeling this way.",3
"I hate who I am. I've lived a perfectly good life, had loving parents, was never bullied, whatever. Right now I have plenty of friends, a decent social life. I have no excuse for feeling how I feel and I just constantly beat myself up for it. Yet here we are, me just doing drugs every night and eating shitty food in the hopes that they'll kill me faster. Pretty much given up on college, no clue how I'm ever gonna graduate, but not like it matters since I'm not doing anything with my life anyway. Next phase is to get some dead end job till death finally comes. Not much to look forward to. Would have offed myself long ago if it wasn't for my parents, I can't give them the pain of losing their only child to suicide. I also don't wanna hurt my friends, but I'm doing a pretty good job of distancing myself from them so that probably won't be an issue in the future. Living for others sucks, but I mean, what other choice do I have?  I'm definitely not gonna live for myself when the time comes.

So here I am just patiently waiting death. For the most part I've stopped feeling anything. Some days (today) it just hits me like a train, but I usually wake up, just lumber through the whole day doing what's ""expected"" of me, all fake smiles and funny jokes to make people think that I'm normal. Then I come back, waste time with videos games or drugs, sleep, rinse and repeat. I've tried to start a hobby, but I always lose motivation, try to talk to people, but only exchange empty words. Don't see my condition improving in any way (not like it's possible anyway). Life sucks, it always has and always will. I just really hope that I don't get the chance to make it to 30 years.

I despise this cycle, I hate that you're forced to participate, and I hate that people tell you that you're the one with ""a problem"" for thinking that things shouldn't be this way. Isn't it cruel to keep someone in misery when relief is so easily available? But of course, forcing them to suffer is obviously the moral choice here. So I guess suffer I will, cause apparently society decided that this was the right choice. 

In short, all I'm looking forward to is the day that I'll be able to kill myself guilt free, hope it'll come sooner rather than later.",5
"Hey people, I'm M17 and I struggle with depression for quit a long time. For a few months I thought everything would get better.

"Failing half my classes, same as last semester, going to drop out of college at the end of the semester with no life direction, no ambition, no motivation, no desires, dreams, will to live.

I've worn short sleeve shirts my whole life almost never wearing long sleeves (not counting hoodies/coats/etc) so I'll definitely receive lots of questions if I'm sweating my ass off wearing a long sleeve shirt for no reason during hot summer days. 

Don't really see a way out of this shitty life other than killing myself. Mom asked me a couple weeks ago where I see myself in 10 years. I told her I didn't know, but all I could think was that I don't see any scenario where I'm alive in 10 years. Might as well just off myself now before everything goes to shit... sorry... before everything gets even shittier just like it always does. Cutting my hand right now cause I know it won't leave scars like are on my arm. Don't even know why I'm writing this. Maybe I just need to rant or get this off my chest.

Whatever happens I just don't care nothing bothers me or phases me I've been so unhappy for so long and no one even knows what goes on in my mind. I feel like it's never ending.

One example of my ridiculous hypocrisy was when I ranted about my friend who's in a terrible family situation. I constantly insulted him and said that he was faking depression and begging for attention. What he was doing was begging for sympathy and I had no right to be saying anything because people who are depressed are more inclined to act that way. And even now I make fun of him. I don't know what is wrong with me except for everything. And now I'm the one begging for sympathy. And I'm somewhat glad that nobody gives it to me because I don't deserve sympathy.

I really want to die. I've reached the point where I would be fine with a car crashing into mine and killing me, or being shot, or getting a terminal illness; I'm not picky over how I die, I just want to vanish from Earth. And I'm too much of a coward to do it myself, though I think about it all the time. My family has grown attached to me, despite the fact that they used to hate my guts during my teenage years. I fixed my relationship with them, and I know dying would hurt them but I'm a selfish idiot. 

I recently started college and it's awful. I used to be a great student in high school, the type of student teachers praise by saying they have a great future ahead of them. But along the way I fucked up. I feel dumber and dumber each day, I see my classmates learning quick while I struggle to understand a simple class. I can barely finish assignments on time and each day I find less reasons to finish them. I fear failing my classes, I've never failed one before but at the rate this is going I probably will. My family has put so many high expectations on me, and I've always known I would never meet them. 
I'm not even studying what I wanted because my mother disapproved of my original career choice. I wanted to study physics, but she made me study electronic engineering. 
The firsts exams were awful, I know I still have time to recover from my pitifully mediocre scores but I seriously doubt I will. 

I have no friends, my personality is awful and I never learned how to talk to people, I'm too awkward. I'm also incredibly hideous and fat, there's nothing I like about myself. I absolutely loathe everything about myself. There's no redeeming quality about me. I used to think I was smart but it's clear I'm a dumb idiot that never should had been born. I wish my mother aborted me when she had the chance. I'm just a fucking waste of space. 

I can't even cry anymore. Hell, I don't even feel anything most of the time. I'm just numb, but sometimes I feel dread settle over me and not leave for days. I'm an useless, worthless piece of shit. I know that. I just want to disappear. I hope to fall asleep and never wake up. 
My birthday is in two days but I don't think I can handle turning eighteen years old, I know not much will change but I can't just keep living.

"I thought I escaped the depression. From the first dose of my Spiro and Estrogen I felt a huge weight off of my shoulders. It was time to be myself and thrive. I enjoyed it. I no longer needed to hide. After a couple of months I thought I'd try dating. Of course, I expected the hate messages. I expected the slurs. What I never expected was the amount of men that maintained interest after I disclosed that I'm transgender. What I soon found was a pattern. A pattern I could not escape. It was in this moment I realized what being a living fetish is like. 

For the past nine months I've been nothing more to men than a source for pictures and a discreet fun time. I still fall for the player saying he wants something more than hooking up just to be used, ghosted, and hit up when he is drunk and horny. The first few times hurt my ego but I recovered. Having the same story for nine months straight makes me question if this is all that life has for me. 

I want nothing more than to just connect with someone. Talk with a guy about life and get to know each other. But. The only attention I ever get are if I post naughty pics or nudes. Once I show and indication that I'm human they ghost. I've made a few trans friends and the story is the same. Doesn't matter how pretty. How much they pass. We're just a fetish and nothing more. It makes sense why they're all either depressed or escorts. 

I've fought the desire to end it completely so I no longer have to deal with the loneliness. It's a crippling loneliness. I'll never find love.",1

"Writing is basically my only talent. It's the one thing I can do with consistency. I'm not athletic. My art is passable but nowhere near good. I can't do stuff with computers. I can't make music. Don't do anything with friends because I don't really have any. So I write. 

Didn't mesh with one of my classes for this semester. Subbed it with a CW class because why not? We had to do a setting/dialogue assignment a while ago and just got them back. 

In short, I did sh*t, apparently. 

Basically, it wasn't really what we were supposed to do for the assignment. That's fine; I misunderstood the instructions and will do better next time. The problem is, he didn't say he liked anything I did. I did a little piece based on a project I've been kicking around that I really liked. I thought it was good. I wanted it to be good. I wanted someone who does this stuff professionally for a living to think it was good. But the note he left read to me like he didn't really care about it or didn't like it. 

And that hurts. Really really hurts. Writing is basically my only talent. I want to publish something someday. I want to be able to hold a book I wrote in my hands and feel like all those sh*tty experiences I had in high school and so far in college could be balanced out by something good I did under my own power without anyone else. Something that could only be chalked up to me. Something that could get me some modicum of respect. Something that could prove I'm not just some boring person with nothing interesting about them who's completely, utterly average. And now the thing I did to have fun and get better has made me feel awful.",2
I feel like everyone just doesn't appreciate me. And I only feel this because of school. My teacher told me today that if I didn't do anything that would be more helpful than me actually trying to do something. I'm only 10 and I feel like no one my age should be feeling like this. I know you people are much older and have to deal with way worse problems but when your a goddamn 5th grader life shouldn't make you feel like your worthless. My entire day was filled with unfairness. Teachers have their favorites and if you aren't one of them you'll be treated like shit.,2

But I need to be selfish for today and do something for myself and put an end to this.

HOW?? once we find a medication that pulls me out of this slump then we can talk about that, but christ lady. I do wonder if my psychiatrist has ever been depressed and knows what it's actually like to have your brain constantly working against you. I respect Healthcare professionals 100% but I feel like this is one of those things you need to experience to understand. just because some people have absurd willpower, and some people can get out of it themselves, doesn't mean everyone can.

"When my ego dies, will it take me with it?

It's a selfish creature. It needs to be the best. It needs to be important. It needs people to agree with it. It throws tantrums. It lashes out when it's made to feel small. It thrives when it elevates itself above others. It thrives when it acts as if I am its personal chariot. It beats me down, demanding more than I could ever give. It piles on while I lie on the floor. It lives in a fantasy world full of delusion and self importance. But I withstand. I persist. It's all I know. It hurts. I suffer at its hands. I'm blinded. I was blinded. Now I see. Its time has passed. Once it goes, I can live without imagined fear. Once it's gone, I can truly live. Tonight I go deeper. Tonight it howls in pain. Only the void listens.

I want to tell my story. I want to be understood. I want to be remembered. Death is stalking us. Suicide or covid-19.  Car wreck  or cancer. Go out in a blaze or just simply die in  your sleep.   


I have suicidal ideations but i'm not sure if they are real or that it is just I see death  stalking me. Why kill myself?  No need.  Death is using the clues that i leave everywhere so that it can find me. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is blind. Death is blind. It just creeps around touching and feeling things until it finds it's prey and then it simply  taps you on the shoulder. Your left shoulder. Then it will whisper it's secret to you.  When you know death's secret, then you are dead. Everything beyond that is a secret.  It is the only secret in the history of the world that has ever been truly kept.    


The dead unswervingly serve their master.  No secrets told .  Death cannot be betrayed.  It cradled you before you born and  will hold you once again when you die. 

It isn't evil. It just IS. Everything just IS. 

I hope i am brave when I  finally feel that tap on my shoulder.  I want to greet death like an old friend because it is.  Death is our mother. It loves us unconditionally and will deny no one of it's love.  Oblivion is just fancy word eternal peace.   


We all want peace.  We want the  vibrations to subside and   when  the blur finally stops , we are left   with the secret we were told.  That secret that tells itself.     It wasn't such a  secret after all. Ashes  Ashes   We all fall down.",5

 I assure you, There's always something worse than what you're going through. It can get worse. Per that same logic, there's always the chance it gets better. I think I hold onto that and you should too.

 You might have realised at some point, people in your life leave. They come and go, and the only constant in your life is you. You have your back, and that's what matters at the end of the day. Keeping this in mind, Take care of yourself and be proactive towards seeking friendships and human connections whenever possible. We humans are social creatures, so having this emotional connection can literally save you. It saved me, at least.

My friends are disappearing one by one, school is getting harder and harder by the day, my anxiety has entered its way into mind, and dark thoughts cloud over anything bright. I just can't. I want to die, but I also fear what will happen after. I'm scared that maybe in the future things will get better, but because I'm dead I'll miss out. But also keep asking myself why does that matter? And the crazy thing is...my life isn't bad. Because even if I lost a few friends in my life, I also still have a lot of good ones. I have a lovely mother that cares deeply about me. I have some kind of passion that keeps me driven. So do I feel down. Because mentality, I'm unhappy. Because my friends don't trust me to tell me important things. Because I love my mom, but I want to get back on good terms with my dad to. Because I have passions yet I can't seem to pick up the pencil and write, draw, dream.  I hate this feeling. I wish I lived in my own world personalized just for me. It would be so much easier. I look at others and wonder what it's like to be like them. What is it like to be popular, associate yourself with everyone. What is it like to have a boyfriend and experience your first kiss. What is it like to have good grades in all classes. What is it like to be normal...I just want to feel worthy. I want to feel important. I want to feel genuinely happy in my life. In all honesty, I'm just really lonely. Love from your parents are great, but love from the people around you like your friends are so much more to me. Like it's expected of parents to love their kid(s), but when a friend loves you, it means something. At least for me. I'm 9th grade, only 14.

"I'm not relatively new to depression, as I have been suffering from it for nearly 3 years now. 

But there are a whole lot of different things at play that are contributing to my depression. My severe anxiety over work, relationships, friendships, and money.  And the worst is the intrusive thoughts. Not just about suicide, though. Other things as well and I'm sad to say I've acted on these thoughts already. Not proud, but I can't fix it now. 

I don't really need any consoling or anything. I'm not considering ending my life because I have no reason to. I am fully aware these thoughts are the depression and not my true thoughts.

"So, I have really bad emetophobia. That means I have a fear of vomit. Â I have horrible dreams about vomit every night. Last night I had the worst vomit dream yet about my brother vomiting and it was so traumatic that it is really sticking with me today, I couldn't shake the horrible feelings. I found out after I woke up that he is actually sick and has been vomiting. But I have to go to an orchestra thing with him and my family tonight. I was obviously worried about it and my mom got upset about it and told me not to ruin the family's day. I really didn't know what to do because I had been on the edge of crying all day. I feel like my family thinks I am selfish forÂ  expressing my anxiety about this and I feel shame. At the concert it was fine and I was coping. But after the concert, my brother said he felt sick and thaf made me really anxious. I kept walking so I was away from him, preferably ahead. We went down a bunch of stairs and my anxiety grew. We went in an open area and I was so terrified that I would see him do the thing that I started to tear up. By the time we got outside I was crying silently to myself. The whole way to the car I was behind everybody so nobody knew I was crying harder and harder thinking about what I could do to avoid getting in a car with him, but thinking that my parents would get mad and think I'm ridiculous. When we got there we were about to get in an elevator and I was hyperventilating to the point that they looked. They went up the elevator and Mystica came with me while I almost collapsed on the stairwell. I literally was gasping so much I couldn't breathe. My mom came down the stairs and asked me if this was because I thought Michael would vom. I said yes. She said I need to pull my act together, that she doesn't want me to ruin their night,Â  she wanted it to be a happy night. She told me that he hasn't vomited yet so I shouldn't be like this. She said I need to pull it together. This was all in a raised voice and I could tell she was mad. 

This hurt me and invalidated me so, so much. I stared blankly the ride home and then I texted her pouring my heart out about how hurt I am. She still didn't really seem to care. 

I'm honestly a little bit surprised because I didn't think it was possible to feel so fucking isolated. I didn't think she would do something this bad. I left and slept at somebody else's house. I feel so horrible and worthless.

"I guess this isn't really a stereotype, but I often see depressed people in movies/shows/etc portrayed as a person fighting their depression alone, meanwhile trying to make everyone else in their life happy so they'll never experience that sadness. 


But ever since I've been depressed (roughly 5 years now) I've been the most cynical person. I hate other people's happiness, when someone accomplishes something all I do is think about my failures. I obviously am outwardly supportive, but inside I'm so resentful. I feel like am truly an awful person, I don't remember the last time I was genuinely happy for someone. I really just cannot connect with people on any emotional level anymore. I just feel like alien.


Does anyone else feel this way? Or do you try to make other people happy to make up for you not being happy yourself? Does this help you, as in does other people's happiness help to alleviate yours slightly? 


&amp; also, to people that don't resent other people's happiness, how? All I can think about is how unfair it is that others can be so happy when I'm hardly staying afloat

"I've been sitting here for close to an hour trying to write something because I have been told talking about this stuff helps, but I don't have anyone to go to so here I am.

I recently started grad school which, being honest, has been a great time. That's probably the scariest part. The fact that I can still be so happy at times and immediately crash in the same day. I moved quite a few states over so I am basically restarting my life which isn't too hard considering I really only had one friend and a girlfriend back home (let's called them S and A respectively), but the longer I've been here, the lonelier I got. Sure I've been making a new friend here or there, but it just feels like it's because we've all been forced to move here and deal with it.

I've been trying to talk to S and A whenever I feel down, but they're both starting med school so they're typically busy. That and I always feel awful asking people for help so usually I'll just pretend like I'm okay so really I only tell them about maybe 10% of what's going on.

Well A dumped me on Christmas (talk about cliche, eh?) so there goes that. I guess that explains why she's hardly been responding to me the past month or so. And I tried talking to S about how awful I felt and her response was essentially, ""You need to get more friends because it exhausting being the only one who can help you."" So after a couple weeks of building up the courage to finally talk to S about how depressed I am, she just tells me she can't help me because she's too busy. Her only advice was to ""stay positive because things will get better"" even though I literally can't think positively right now. Feelsgoodman.

This is where it gets really hard. Yes I could always turn to family, but I've never been open with my family and I just can't. I know it's what I should do, but it was physically painful opening up to my friend let alone my entire family. I just can't bring myself to ask them for help.

I've been having suicidal thoughts ever since I moved to my grad school but I just shrugged them off before as me just being melodramatic and having a dark sense of humor. Well now I can't shrug them off no matter what I do. I would comfort myself by repeating the reasons why I wouldn't kill myself. My girlfriend would be horrified. My family would be devastated. My colleagues would be upset. But now all these reasons just fade away and all I'm left with is ""my parents spent too much money on me to let it go to waste."" That's it. That's the only reason I won't actually kill myself.

I've been trying to motivate myself with the future, but that doesn't work. There's nothing I really want to do. No goals I have to achieve, no plans I want to make, no where I need to travel to. I just keep coming back to the money my parents invested in me. That's all I am right now. An investment.

Is it a shitty life? Yea, probably. I would love to enjoy my life, but all I can hope for now is to eventually be useful somehow and better our world.

I'm sorry if it was barely coherent. I lost my train of thought quite a few times. I think the total time it took me to write this was around 2 hours because I kept having to force myself to continue.

Sorry it's such a long post. I just needed someone to go to because I don't have anyone right now.

P.S. I'm sorry if this is a duplicate. I deleted my first post immediately after posting it out of regret, but am forcing myself to leave it this time.",4

"4 am, can't sleep, as always. I really need to get this out of my chest. I apologize for the long text, but I really need some advice. My life is s complete mess atm and I don't know what to do.

Long story short, I'm 20 years old uninteresting guy, whose future has no purpose at all. I've never had a girlfriend, I'm studying a degree I don't like all and I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, with minimal chances for getting better.

It all started when I was 15. I went to the hospital because I thought I was having some sort of heart attack. After many cardiac exams, I was later diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder. Although, the fear of dying still haunts me constantly. 

 Due to this fact and some other conditions, my grades started  gradually decreasing. At the moment, I'm at the 3rd year of my graduation, studying retail management at a small university. I hate the subjects I'm studying. Every time I wake up and think about needing to the classes, I get more and more demotivated. Needless to say I already failed several subjects and my grades are shit. I can't see myself doing this professionally, but it's too late to give up now, my parents paid for 3 years of studying and I can't disappoint them and waste their money completely. Back in days, I really like Informatics Engineering and Psychology, but due to my awful high school performance, my grades weren't high enough to ingress in any of these graduations. 

My only interests now are music, sports betting, writing, photography and videogames, but there's no real way I could make money and live on that. My self-esteem is as low as it can be, no girl seems to find interest in me. I might be really ugly or I lack some serious social skills. I can count my friends with a single hand, and we usually spend most of the times playing videogames, so I don't go out that much. I find to make a good first impression sometimes, but then I always screw everything up. The only things keeping me on track are drinking, smoking, gambling and occasionally doing drugs.

I wish I had the guts to pack my things up and start a new life somewhere else, but I'm a coward. Every day is a fucking nightmare, I feel slowly getting  physically sick, depressed and more hopeless as the time goes by. I can't stand myself and my life, but I lack the power, energy and motivation to change it.",2
"Apparently they ""reset"" a depressed brain by activating certain areas that increase feelings of wellbeing for months.  Has anyone ever tried it?",5
"I have improved my life significantly over the past two years: I found an antidepressant that works for me, I've gone back to school, I've got a steady job, I've even gone on a few dates, and I adopted a dog to give me a place to focus my attention and love on. 

I thought that if I could improve myself, or at least improve my situation, that it would feel better, and in some ways i guess it does.

The depression is still there though. It's not as constant ,and in fact as long as I'm around someone, my friends, my family, or even my dog, I feel alright. But it never really goes away. Sometimes I'm watching a movie, or listening to a song, or taking too long to go to sleep it hits me.

In these moments I remember that I'm a useless waste of life. All of my accomplishments are stripped away to reveal the fact that I'm just a bunch of nothing. In time it goes away but it's never too long before I revisit those feelings.

Is it the same for anyone else? Can you truly ever ""get over"" depression?",3
"Hey. If you're reading this then...well that means I went through with what I was thinking. Then again, it was a stupid idea so if you are reading this I've gone insane. Now, you will not know my name because it doesn't need to be revealed for this. Maybe someday I'll be strong enough to face it, I mean people will find out eventually. You're probably really confused...so I'll just get straight to the point. I'm here to tell you my story. Usually I don't talk about my life...actually I really don't talk about it at all. There are certain things I'm not going to share of course, things I vowed to myself I would keep secret until death. Honestly I don't even know why I'm doing this. I just really need to get some stuff of my chest. Life. Sucks. At least it does for me. It didn't always..I used to be this innocent bright and cheery kid..but I guess the more I grew the more I realized how messed up society and basically the entire world is. You see, the first time I ever felt different was in 5th grade. People would make fun of me, call me stupid, tease me, call my old life weird and dumb. There were other things but I can't remember...I've spent 3 years learning to forget. The day it became too much for me to hold in is when everything changed. I was sitting down taking it all in when I just broke. My shield that was keeping them from hurting me...shattered into a million pieces along with my heart, my mind, my soul, my life. I ran to the bathroom and cried for what seemed like forever. I went back to class acting as if I was fine and that nothing happened. Everyday it just got worse. Then summer came, and I was able to start feeling normal. No more people to worry about, I didn't dread leaving my house. 6th grade came around, and I met the most amazing people that I will remember for the rest of my life. 6th grade was a good year, my grades were good, I had great friends...but there was still something that was off. Around the end of the year I started getting these awful thoughts. Regret filled my life. There were so many things that I wished I could redo and I still do. Everyday of my life I think about it and think of how stupid I was. Iwas so careless and didn't realize that what I had done could ruin my life. Now what I did exactly won't be shared...if anyone ever found out I wouldn't be able to live with myself. I can barely do that now and I'm the only one who knows. Summer came around again, and the thoughts got worse. They aren't just bad thoughts about being sad and depressed...I started getting suicidal thoughts...hundreds of them everyday. I dreaded going back to school. I had people in my class that bullied me in 5th grade. I didn't want to go through that again. So...one night I had an idea. I was at a very low point and was contemplating suicide. I ended up chickening out...but some days I wonder if it would have actually worked. Part of me wishes I went through with it, the other half is glad I didn't. School came around, I was performing well, and the kids didn't even say anything at all. My friends and I became even more close.My teachers were amazing. 7th grade, I have to say was the happiest point of my life I had ever been in for an extreme amount of time. When it came to an end however so did that happiness. Suicide crossed my mind even more, I started self harming in ways that no one would notice. I would do the stereotypical thing and just blame the cat. 8th grade came. My grades dropped. I couldn't find the energy to do anything. I was constantly tired and I still am. My dreams faded, my hopes for a better life went away because I know that would never happen. I got this app, kik. I should've known to delete the minute I got it. Part of my past revolves around this dumb app. Actually it's what started EVERYTHING. And it's all. my. fault. I hate myself for it. I worry about so many people I've met on the app. I love them all, they're great people and I've stopped caring for myself ever since then. I just wish everything would go away. There is honestly so much more to this story, but if I were to tell it all it would take me a million years. Now...we've hit the present. I've stopped eating three meals a day. Some Days I barely get it one. But that's ok...I like the feeling of hunger. I like the pain of the blade when it passesover my arm. I like being alone, the less people who know me, the less I can hurt them. The more fake smiles I put on, the more people leave me alone, and believe I'm fine. I'm suicidal but no one knows. I can't tell anyone...I won't tell anyone.At least personally. This, what I'm doing anonymously is fine. I can tell my story without feeling too judged. Even if I was...it would be nothing compared to how I judge and hate myself. And now you've made it to the end...sorry it was so long. There's so much more to it than that...that's just the basic stuff behind my real emotions...the emotions that are fading. The emotions that I will soon lose, in fact I'm pretty sure I already have.

"This is my first NYE being 21, and I'm sick as fuck. I have a terrible stomach flu and all I wanted was to go downtown in a nice outfit and do drinking things. But instead, I'm sick, I'm alone, I'm supposed to work tomorrow, I'm in hell. New Year's is the only holiday besides Halloween that I care about, and I'm suffering on it.  
  
I had such a nice plan to see a friend I haven't seen in months. We were going to go out with a group and come back to her place and smoke.

"A little background about myself:I have always been struggling with depression, anxiety and self-worth issue. It was not always like this, I remember a time, about 15 years back when I was a confident and energetic child. But over the past 15 years I have been hurt and bullied to the point where i have lose any confidence i have in myself and have zero-self worth. Often being an entertainment for others, I just feel like my life is destined to be an entertainment for others, always there to bring happiness and joy to others at the expense of getting hurt myself.

First forward I am 20 years old now and have attempted sucide about 3 times, each time I was stopped. A few months back, I met this girl who was really amazing and we started talking and got quite close as friends. A few months ago I asked her for the opportunity to woo her and she say she will consider after I have touched her, nonetheless we continue chatting and we got so close to the point that we actually planned an overseas trip together for Christmas.

Fast forward to the trip, it was amazing and I (we) had a blast, however, on the last day, things started to take a turn for the worst. Her reply started getting very cold and she blocked me from her social. As we were staying in separate hotels I attempted to commit sucide again, only to be stopped by my friend who called the hotel and got the general manager to came up and stop me. 

Fast forward a few days from that, her reply to my messages has been nothing but cold, distant and it takes her hours to reply and that is if she ever reply at all. I really wondered what I did wrong. I tried asking her but she told me it was nothing and that she was just busy. But unfortunately, this has totally destroyed what ever little self-confidence and drive I have left and I just feel that I have suddenly plunged into darkness.

After 4 failed attempts I realise I'm too much of a wimp to do anything directly resulting in ending my life. I just want to stop existing as well. Today is New Year eve and I really just feel like wanting to just OD on pills and just hope I would never wake up tomorrow. Since for the most part of my life, everyone has been treating me as entertainment, I feel by doing this, I can present a finale to everybody, show everyone behind the fake smile that I has put on for so long....my friend scolded me for being so pathetic to put my happiness and life in the control of a girl but  for the past few months, my focus was only on her and I really enjoyed her company. I really don't know what happened and I really don't wanna lost this friendship, it is really ok if we don't get together but I do not want to lose this friendship as well.

I am really lost, really sad and really distant...I really don't know what to do anymore other than just not exist since I feel like a disappointment to everybody (average student, not much achievements, generally a disappointment) I use feel like lying down tonight and never waking up tomorrow.",1

Nothing has meaning, il never find what I'm looking for, I'm better off staying in my room and not going to school at all, nothing Ive ever known was real. I just really want to die but I'm too much of a pussy to do it, id only do it for attention anyway.",4
"I'm trapped.

I have a job that I can't quit, because my family is reliant on the health benefits, and the income of course, and I'm in a field where I can't just simply find an upwardly mobile position. I also do a rather specific thing so my skill set is not easily translatable to other jobs - IOW I can't even make a lateral move. At this point, I can't go up, I cant go sideways, and the only way to go is down (which is possible because sometimes budget cuts have cut positions like mine - though uncommon, still a real possibility). Otherwise I could retire out of the position, but by then, the amount of retirement won't really be significant nor enough to live off.

I feel trapped.

This is going to sound horrible, but my spouse has become an anchor that's dragging me down. They have health issues, and my job's benefits cover those. But they also have a number of other problems. I don't want to blame my problems on someone else but here's the problem: I've come to the conclusion that people only change if they want to change. My spouse needs to change. But I can't make them do that. I can't ask or suggest it. If I do I'm met with resistance. My only option is to get away from them, or put up with their shit - which I've been doing for 20+ years. But here's the thing - we have children now and one exhibits most of the same behaviors my spouse does - and I've come to realize over the years that my spouse had a parent who also exhibited the same issues. Now though, our child is amplifying these issues - to the point where I see it as my spouse's fault that my child is this way. My spouse hasn't been diagnosed, but I'd say they are a hoarder. So is the child. My spouse refuses to listen to reason, or advice, or will not take any suggestions or recommendations - essentially is stubborn. So is the child. I could go on and on but the basic deal is that I could put up with it to some degree with the spouse, but now that the child is doing it too, it's too much to bear.

It may be my fault for being an ""enabler"" and letting them walk all over me - maybe I'm too weak, I don't know, but I don't feel it's right to force someone else to do something. But I also have given up on trying to convince them of the right thing to do.

It doesn't help that my spouse has become less and less interested in physical love over the years.

I think you have to have grounds for a divorce. I don't want to get a divorce - I don't want to be that person - I want it to work out - and it makes me feel like I'm giving up, and running away, which is not what I'm supposed to do. But again, I'm not strong enough to face this issue.

My spouse's issues have also put us in a financial mess. We're barely making it. So I couldn't' get a divorce if I wanted one, because I can't afford a lawyer.

And it seems like EVERYTHING is like that - I can't make more money without spending money I don't have to get a higher degree - which doesn't even guarantee a job. I can't get a divorce without spending money I don't have to do so. I can't afford a therapist because it's going to cost me money.

IOW, everything is a significant investment with no promise of any return on that investment - I'll only wind up deeper in the hole.

I'm not suicidal, and I don't want to make light of depression, but I am at the point where really, there's nothing to look forward to anymore. Sure, seeing the kids graduate, having grandkids would be cool, and so on. But it's like, the only way I'll ever get the house clean is if my spouse passes away and I can finally get rid of all of their trash. But what little income they do make will be gone (no life insurance) so the house we've fought so hard to keep will also be gone (becuase we had to refinance and now we'll be paying until we're 90, or dead). If I go, well, I guess it won't be my problem anymore.

So I'm trapped again.

Getting out of the marriage - well, even if I could, there'd be child support that I couldn't afford.

So it's either stay here and put up with and accept the blistering mediocrity that is my life, while things just continue to deteriorate and deteriorate, or just go away. Which is not really something I'm considering, so really, I'm trapped in a life of mediocrity in a downward spiral. My spouse won't change. My child will probably become even worse with age. I'm just going to get more and more distant.

I've considered having an affair - but you know what - I'm not the type of person others are attracted to - I don't have any money so the shallow people aren't attracted to me, and I'd have to pay for a service like an affair site - which I know most aren't really legit and even the somewhat legit ones aren't going to have people who are attracted to me becuase I'm the person they married, not the person they want to have a fling with. Plus, it costs money I don't have.

But you know, I'm not really interested in having an affair. At best it would just be something different to do. And I don't want to treat someone else like that. And I don't want to do that to my spouse. The only thing would be, it would at least be grounds for a divorce.

I mean, it's almost - almost mind you - and this would make a good movie plot maybe - it's almost like my spouse has engineered this entire scenario of getting me into a job and family situation where they keep me poor enough to not be able to get out, but just stable enough where they can lay in bed all day and read books, while not helping around the house or with the kids in any meaningful way, on the premise that while they might not be contributing to the finances this month, or for 6 months, in one month they may make a significant enough amount of money to bring us up to just barely behind and keep me trapped in this position.

Kind of like how America treats the majority of its citizens, but I digress. But yeah, the current national climate doesn't help with hope really.

My job does offer 4 free sessions with a therapist. But I see that turning into a money making scam for them ultimately - get you hooked and then...

And I can hear the advice now - that's not going to help.

Basically, my spouse needs to change and if they don't I need to get out. I know they're not going to change. I don't think it's right to give someone ultimatums - I think they need to come to the decision on their own. But it's pretty clear that's not going to happen. And at this point, I've done enough by myself without any support from my spouse I'm don't have the energy or strength to try to help them change, becuase they're not going to accept that there's even anything wrong with what they're doing. I believe it would take me leaving and being gone for them to finally realize it (which, because they have issues with depression, might set me up for guilt for the rest of my life...).

"I got diagnosed with a pretty serious autoimmune disease about 5 months ago. The prognosis isn't great. I can take steroids and a few other drugs to halt the progress, but eventually, it's gonna destroy my stomach/GI tract. I might make it to 70, but that's not really realistic. All I know is that my life is going to be painful. It already is, but long term, it's just gonna get worse. 

For those of y'all with chronic illness, how do you deal with the knowledge that things are only going to get worse? How can you maintain hope when there really isn't any reason to have it? I'm never going to be able to live a normal life. What woman would ever want to date a guy who is gonna die in his 60's? On the off chance that I can have kids without fucking them up with my disease, is it even ethical to do it when I can't commit to being there for them?

"I'll just try to make it short (and fail trying) My problem isn't worth really mentioning, I'm a privileged little shit that doesn't have it nearly as bad as most folks here, I even have a supporting girlfriend from a long distance who is also very anxious and depressed. But it helps a little to write it out somewhere. I've graduated from high school around nearly 3 years ago at this point. I'm 20 years old, highly anxious and I've always felt like a dissapointment to my family in every single way imaginable. I barely passed high school, and I hated myself for falling behind and ever since then it's been going down hill with me feeling like a piece of shit for not being where everyone else is. I didn't apply for any colleges right after high school, I didn't make any plans, for some reason I felt like my life was going to be over after high school. I was never thinking about the future but more so the next day. I put off working for quite some time. The thought of standing there socializing or handling money gets my nerves all riled up so I put it off. My parents weren't gonna pay or help pay for a local college so I was kinda stuck here just deciding to do nothing. I don't know why but it just felt pointless. I don't know what I wanna do for the rest of my life, I don't know if what I wanna do is gonna matter. I'm still gonna be a piece of shit that always makes the wrong choices so what's the point? I don't know it sounds pathetic but I don't know.

I lost most of my friends in this time frame, mostly because I cut contact with them because I was so ashamed of myself for doing nothing even though I had all the means to do something while they were going to school and doing what they were supposed to do. I was running out of excuses as to why I'm not doing anything. So two years go by like this, I numb myself with video games and don't answer any calls. I sit in my room all day every day and do nothing and try not to think about it. Sorry this is all over the place, there was someone I met that I unwillingly became friends with but ended up breaking the friendship with her sometime after her mother died. That left me feeling like a selfish piece of shit for quite some time, to fake being a friend. Also left me feeling incredibly guilty because said person needed support after her mother passed and I was just sitting here being a dick. 

I don't know. I can't get myself to do anything worth while. I get overwhelmed easily and I don't have the energy to jump start everything. The future looks so bleak and empty. Like fuck I can't imagine being 30 years old and still in this position. With each passing day I do nothing, the more I feel like a piece of shit. I don't know where to start. I get too anxious undergoing basic social interactions, getting a haircut feels like a nightmare since I'm infront of so many people and I'm absolutely petrified of running into the people I isolated from. I don't know, I've given myself ultimatums in the past. Last year I told myself if nothing changed by the end of the year then I'd have to go to the military but I didn't end up doing that. I'm just tired of it. It's like an endless cycle. I go out there, try to do something  realize I won't be able to stop working for the rest of my life and have to face the responsibilities of being an adult with so much social interaction and painful weeks. Or I do nothing about it, stay at home and don't be an adult and hate myself over doing nothing about my current situation. It felt good back then having a due date. With the military option back in 2016 it atleast made me feel at ease that I could die if things got too bad. Feels like I'm backing myself into a wall here. I can't do another year of this. I can't turn 21 and still not change, I feel like I'm gonna be like this for the rest of my life. Nothing I do is ever gonna have any kind of meaning either. It's getting harder and harder to find a good reason to live if not for other people. It's not going to get better I'm not gonna change because deep down all my problems come from me and I can't not be me. So it's fucked, I'm what's wrong with my life. Why should I live with that for 60 more years?",5

"A crisp white coating engulfed the road at 5am. Another sleepless night, another crunchy step taken on the path to escape. It's like a deathbed, cold yet in a way comforting. 

The dimly lit roads winding through the hills all seemingly leading nowhere but in an endless circle. A cruel metaphor of life. Trapping once beautiful souls, emptying them, and leaving nothing but a mere skeleton. 

A real world dementor. Intercepting excitement during the most joyous time of the year. Holiday spirit flows through the air but all you can feel is the dark aura you are confronted with. 

Yet somehow I'm coming to accept that it's okay. A newfound serenity in an alternate state. One where my writing has meaning again, a true reflection. 

All this sounds more beautiful in my head. Like a poetic verse that captures the slight feelings I still have within me. The written words that fill the void of those that can no longer be spoken. ",5
"I am finally numb to it. And it feels good. It feels good to feel nothing instead of crying and just wishing to be dead, the mental agony I've experienced throughout my life is so very painful in a way I can't describe. Me sitting down calmly and wanting to die is a lot better than me crying and hurting myself because the âpainâ is so terrible. 

I can't escape him. I can't escape my father. His voice is in my head every time I don't do anything perfectly. When I look in the mirror. What he said about me mirrors how I think about myself still. 
I always end up dating men just like him. They make me feel crazy and emotionally and mentally abuse me to no end. The guy I thought I loved just told me yesterday that I should be happy that it took him âthis longâ to start pretending to throw heavy objects at me angrily.

The numbness is much better than the depression. Maybe I'll get numb to the point where it'll be easy to kill myself instead of always chickening out. There's nothing for me here. I am selfish and want just one thing: Love, and I can't get it. And I'm not going to stay around waiting in pain and mental anguish until I die, just so other people can benefit off of my love and care. I want something for me for once.

I feel so alone and I think about dying almost every day. I wish I didn't. I feel like the sooner I end my life the better. But I can't bring myself to do it just yet. A tiny bit of me thinks that maybe I should wait, maybe I will get Lucky. But will the suffering be worth it. 

Maybe someone will find me with my wrists slit. Maybe someone will find me hung up in my closet. Maybe then people will understand. Because right now no one does. No one ever has. No matter how many attempts I've made to get people to notice I'm hurting. I fantasize about my death sometimes. I know that's not normal. Hence one more reason why I should not be alive. ",1

"i had some old roomates that i thought were friends that screwed me out of alot of money and stiffed me with a ton of dept and i managed to get an ok job and blew it somehow, got let go the month before i woulda been able to make any real change toward looming bills and collection calls. i had good reviews and was told i was efficient and trusted so it hit me so far outta left field. i lost it as i had so much banking on this job thought people liked me, thought i was stable for once ... i tried to pull myself back up but then i got hurt, broke my jaw and then my jaw got infected and i was hospitalized; severe fever, pain, all the fun times. they had to remove a good portion of my teeth and im only my 30s and now i dont have medical coverage anymore. with no income i cant afford medication or the ambulance bill and someone smashes into my car (im ok) but why now! i finally get unemployment insurance and it only barely covers rent, guess food is optional. i went from being able to afford meals to food banks/food stamps. i had to get rid of my pets cause i cant feed them, that hurt more than anyone should ever have to... and then he got sick and died anyway.

"This past month has hit me like a freight train with red-hot spikes on the front. 

A while ago, I started hooking up with this guy. He's pretty cute, he's lively, outgoing, and funny. I started getting feelings for him, but I was afraid to tell him because I was afraid of getting hurt again. But life finds a way to hurt me anyways.

We hadn't talked in a while, and it made me feel like he was done with me. It sucked, but I knew it was going to happen eventually. Conveniently at this point, my ex hits me up. We start talking about how we're doing and politics (usually not good but we both enjoy talking about it), and then I noticed that he was getting....flirty?

Eventually he asked me if I wanted to be friends with benefits. Stupidly, I agreed, fully knowing that I still had strong feelings for him and never wanted him to break up with me in the first place. A couple days later (yesterday), we planned to meet up. The time came and went, and eventually I figured out that he went on first date with someone and was starting a relationship. That really hurt, and now I'm a mess. The whole year, I've been struggling with severe depression and anxiety, and now I get to know that I was so close to to getting him back but he's with someone else now.

The whole ordeal made me realize again that love is shit, and without love, life is shit. I can't move on from my ex, and even if I could, there's nobody else for me to move to. Except the guy that I hooked up with, *who also happens to be friends with my ex.* I hit him up last night anyways, because I'm so depressed that I don't even care. 

Life in general is terrible too. Relationship woes aside, I have one good friend, and nobody else. My brain is addled with mental disorders (autism, ocd, anxiety, depression, possibly borderline personality disorder). My grades in school are terrible because I've missed weeks of it. I can hardly form meaningful connections with anyone, and even when I do, they just leave me more hurt than I was before.

It's all just terrible, and I don't think I can handle it much longer. I want to live, and succeed, and be in a happy relationship with someone that loves me. But I don't think I can. I'm too broken. All that's keeping me here is my one friend, my own fear of taking myself out, and an infinitely tiny and naive glimmer of hope that I might find my way out of this and back into someone's loving arms.",3

It's not really scary like many believe it to be, but for some other reason I'm scared as hell to have it done.  I don't really know what else to do though.  I'm sick about it.  I'm sick about everything.  Does anyone have any experiences with it?",3
"I have children so I keep going. As they get older I realise how lonely I am. Been single for 5 years, pretend I'm all groovy 'I don't need a man'. 

Boys are getting older now and rather than wanting to play board games and go into the woods for hide and seek etc they just play on the Xbox. And I'm pottering around the house wanting some company, real company. 

Someone to say 'want a cuppa?'  Or to have a random conversation with.

I'm scared once my boys are content and moved out I'll be more lonely, no purpose and I'll go so far down that people won't notice as I hide it.

I work for a charity and visit lonely old people. I don't want to be one of them. I'm only 29 and shouldn't feel like this all because I'm single, surly? 

It's really getting to me if I mention it to friends I just get 'awww you will meet someone, carry on being a strong independent woman until then'

"Hello,

I don't know if other people experience this silly cycle, but I keep finding myself in my room kind of craving some kind of enjoyable social interaction but when it's offered to me I turn it down as I know I'll just be an awkward mess when I get there. So I stay in my room beating myself up at a great opportunity to feel like a normal human by going out and celebrating with old friends.

Some days I can do the whole talking to people thing, it's like I don't even have to try. The words just come out and I'd like to think that I can be kind of interesting sometimes, but about 90% of the time recently I just have nothing to say to people. I want people to laugh at my jokes and I want to create deep and meaningful relationships, but as my brain just won't let me communicate with people outside of just exchanging infomation and I become a robot with nothing to say. 

I just came back from my family house where I can truely feel like myself without being judged and everything is in good fun. I'm open with my brothers and my parents and socially it's a great environment But now that I'm back in my student house I remember how I felt before. I can't be as open, I can't express myself and I've built a relationship with people in this house pretending to be somone I'm not just because I want to have friends so I don't feel like a total loser. I have some good times with these people, but quite often I don't enjoy the current topic or dislike the humor as they've run it into the ground with how often they make the same references or just by talking about stuff I can't relate to in the slightest. It makes me feel that I should be liking this things and I'll be an outsider if I don't.

It's not like I can just go out and make new friends now anyway due to the problem noted second paragraph. The rest of my life is going well, I have a nice job, family is great and I'm starting to lose weight. But without great experiences with friends I feel like I'm still majorly missing out on what other people take for granted.

I've just been offered an opportunity to go and hang out with some friends a few miles away for New Years, but with my anxiety and my socal weirdness just wants me to stay at home. I hate myself for doing it, and it's not the first time I've turned these people down because I just basically don't feel like it, but I know that If I try to go I'll just be awkward and make the experience a bit weird for everyone else there.

tl;dr: I want to be a reasonably interesting person to do it, but my brain just won't let me most of the time and as a result I'm a bit of a social hermit. I want deep friendships and good times, but If I have no personality most of the time, how is that ever going to happen?

I've felt like this for around 4 or 5 years now, and it's getting to the point where I'm not able to enjoy the joy of a good relationship with another human. I've not made seriously good friend since college (uk) and I feel that If I could get this sorted I could feel happy again.

Sorry if this post is a bit everywhere. I have Dyspraxia and what might make sense in my head might not make sense in yours. I hope I've explained myself well enough. 

Happy New Year.

"Every day since we first met for the last 3 years K. has been on my mind. Where ""we clicked"" sounds cliche, sometimes its the only describeable phrase. We talked constantly. If there was free time in the day we wanted to spend time with one another until it was way past time for bed. I had dated only a few women before but with K. I could feel something special. We had a connection, a way of talking about anything that felt so genuine. So unique. Needless to say I loved K., more than I ever thought possible it was to love someone at all. I would to anything for her. I wanted to do **everything** for her. My life felt so complete now that I had someone to share it with, and that made me the happiest I'd ever been. This, surely, was love. Being so devoted to someone and having them feel the same about you. I'd been hurt before but K. made me feel like I could trust again. I felt we were strong together. Several times I would have to leave for weeks or months, and when coming back it felt like we just hit play after having been on pause. 


Every day since K. confessed to an affair she's been on my mind. I didnt think it was possible to hurt so terribly bad. The pain is my heart is physical, the agony is inside me. I never healed from the previous ex that had cheated and I have no hope to heal from this. So much time spent building something beautiful and within an instant it was abandonded. All I want to do is sleep but my dreams are about her. The moment I wake up I remember K. is no longer in my life and dread washes over me. All day long I feel sick. I've lost my appetite, nothing interests me anymore. After spending so long with someone they become a part of who you are and everything around you. Every object or event that happens in your life is related to that person. My life is on pause forever. This, surely, is what dying feels like.",4

"...again. Like the past god forsaken how many years now. 



**Fair warning, this is going to be a pretty sappy post. I am also a terrible writer, so please excuse my completely inept wordsmithery. I apologize if this doesn't belong in r/depression. Please remove if it doesn't.**



This new years will be a little different though. I'll be spending it thinking about a very special someone. Two years ago, I was attending community college. I had started in 2013, and told myself that I would bust my butt off and turn my life around. I wanted to make a change, and get out of the depressing rut I was in (as many of us here can probably relate). I remember coming across so many articles about depression, and basically came to the conclusion that the only way out was to fill my life with ""positive things"" and have some aspiration. And for 3 years straight, that's exactly what I did. I know this might not sound like a very big deal, since its just community college, but I did manage to Ace every class, always studying like their was no tomorrow, and remaining completely goal orientated. The dean herself actually sent me a letter congratulating me as being among the the top 3% in the entire school (its a fairly big campus). Even one of my professors suggested that I become a math tutor, and one year later that's exactly what I did. Not only did I now have a job and was doing well in school, but I was also well on my way to a top research university in my field of study. In my school, math tutors were assigned to the math lab, walk-in basis for free tutoring. One day a girl walked in and asked for some help with her homework. Naturally, I became completely head over heels for this girl. I don't want to bore you with the over-sentimental details, but I think I may be deeply in love with her. I can never stop thinking about her. It's gotten to the point where I honestly wish I had never transferred at all, just so I could talk with her over homework or something, anything. I miss her so much.

Wherever you are Gabby, I hope you're doing well and figure out what you want to do in life and become the best at it. I wish I could have brought you a bouquet of roses and tell you Happy Valentines. I love you so much and miss you everyday. I'll always love you.        ",4

"I have had problems with anxiety since my previous relationship, mainly related to relationship anxieties. 

I met my girlfriend in the summer holidays and we dated until we went to university. Whilst at uni we decided not to do long distance but ended up facetiming every evening for hours on end, and basically carried on dating. 

I was really excited to see her again over the Christmas holidays and then the anxiety kicked up again. I think the long distance had enabled me to not realise it was a relationship until I got home and it hit me and suddenly the fear of making the same mistakes I did in the past relationship hit me. 

I went to the doctors and was placed on anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medication and for the next week things were great again. But then the emotional numbness kicked in. I felt absolutely nothing for anyone or anything and it really got to me. Any feeling I did feel was just anxiety about the relationship. 

I want to get therapy about my relationship fears and I didn't feel like I couldn't do that whilst immersed in the fear, so I decided to break up with her so I could get help. I also stopped the anti-depressants because the numbness it made me feel caused me to self-harm which I've never done before. 

I'm so unbelievably sad. I love her, she's beautiful and kind and funny and I love spending time with her. I don't at all want to end it with her, yet I don't see how I could get help with the anxiety making everything feel like a mountain. 

I can't go back on it, I've hurt her too much by breaking up with her to say ""that pain was unnecessary because let's get back together"". And we agreed that if one of us broke up with the other then we wouldn't go back on it. 

I have this real hope that one day when I've addressed the fears I have that we can reconnect and try again but I know it's unfair on both of us to live with that expectation and hope. 

I have so many regrets and I hate mental illness more that anything. Im so sad that I can't be with her.",4

"I used to be very close with my cousin and felt very protective of him. However, when we were teenagers we grew apart. My cousin is autistic but he always wanted to live independently. Anyway, he left his parents house and started working around the country (United States).

Unfortunately, he ended up living with a woman who had some sort of personality disorder. She was attracted to the fact that he was autistic and liked this vulnerability. When he eventually said that he wished to leave and move on, she tied him up and kept him as a prisoner basically. She would leave him long periods of the day (tied up so he couldn't escape) while she was out at work or shopping and then she used to come back and sexually assault him basically (he is essentially asexual so he didn't even know what was happening to him).

This would have continued for god knows how long until a neighbour found out what was happening and alerted the police.

She is now in prison and out of his life. However, he has been essentially sectioned for a while (because of the mental state he was in) and he is very upset by this as he has always resented his autism 'holding me back' and he wants to leave and start travelling across the United States again. This has lead to him becoming suicidal (which of course is not going to make the doctors want to release him).

I hate seeing him as a shadow of his former self but everytime I visit he asks me if I can help release him?

The problem is that he wants a lifestyle of travel and doing labour here and there. he is very hardworking that is no problem. However, his autism makes him vulnerable and he refuses to see this?

Anyone been in a similar situation?",3

"Hey guys,

I'm hoping someone could shed some light on a situation for me.
I have been diagnosed with major depression disorder and an anxiety disorder. I have been suffering from.bith severe depression and severe anxiety for about 9 months and after trying numerous things to resolve it (including self medicating) I had finally decided to give medication a try.

At first I was put on citalopram, this caused many severe side effects like increased anxiety, insomnia, constantly sweating, nausea, dry mouth etc. But I had a period where for 2 days I had worsening of depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and very impulsive - like - uncontrollable anxiety (with constant shaking for 2 days straight). I visited my doctor as this frightened me and immediately switched my medication to effexor. 

I recall before that episode had happened I had binged on counterfeit oxy and counterfeit Xanax (two pills I have been self medicating with as it's the only thing that helps me feel ""good""). I of course didn't bring this up to my doctor and I am now wondering is it possible that the drugs used to self medicate might be causing alternative effects with the antidepressants?

The effexor seems to be a better fit for me as I didn't have many side effects but I still had a similar episode I had before. It all starts with a painful headache, then horrible thoughts and followed by uncontrollable anxiety that doesn't seem to die down. I remember I self medicated the second time in hopes it would stop the episode but that either didn't work or made it worse.

Does anyone have any insight on this they could share?",3
"To keep things short I hate my life and wished I could kill myself but i cant.

"I am 16M and a black male in a racist area in South Dakota. Whenever I'd make a friend as a little kid, their parents would shoo me away and tell their own kid I'm a criminal because I looked mean and dirty and my parents were. Even the Hispanic kids who get the same rap around here weren't allowed to talk to me. I wore the same clothes every day and rarely showered. It's the same problem as we have now. Technically we have running water and a shower, but it's so filthy and full of grime and backed up poo water that it's less disgusting to go without. I've been bullied and completely friendless since I was 11.

My parents have too high an income to qualify for social programs and spend all their money on drugs and eating out. They live like pigs and leave all their empties and hoarded things everywhere.

I know there are a lot of black people/poor people who have been successful and lived happy lives, but I am much different than them in that I am so easily broken. I am a shell of a person, and I developed epilepsy and another disability that limits my fine motor skills. I have seizures where I can't stop moving a limb repeatedly, lose consciousness for upwards of a minute, or both. It gets worse when I miss doses of medication. I have randomly vomited at times before being diagnosed and treated.

I stopped going to school when I was 14 because I had a seizure at school and pooped my pants. I am ""home schooled"". It doesn't matter if i have a diploma though when nobody wants to hire someone who could have seizures on work time. I'm going to just be on disability until I end it. Nobody cares about me and people who know me will be glad to have me gone.

I don't care if ""it gets better,"" and I won't call a suicide hotline. Please don't respond with clichÃ©s like that. I want you to tell me how to actually fix my life if you know how. If that doesn't work, I'll probably just end it because there is no point prolonging a useless life.",1

"For my entire life, I've been a little off on the inside. I feel like I have felt everything. I had deja vu all the time when I was a bit younger, like I had already seen everything. This grew into anger and hatred for non-original thought. I see it as people thinking that they say original things, but in my mind, it makes me extremely frustrated. 

A little while ago, I started watching anime, primarily moe content. This woke something in me, and it wasn't good. It left me with very high standards and expectations of females, both physically and in terms of personality. Lately I've been seeing all girls around me as unimpressive, and I desire something more.

At this point, I was on the verge of depression. I'm seeing everyone as inferior and not worth spending time with. This is strange for me, because for my whole life I've loved others and felt extreme empathy and compassion for everyone.

So here I am, with high standards, irritable, possibly depressed, lonely, confused and wrathful. Now, another unreasonable standard in finding a female my age (16) approaches. I have developed a desire to be obsessed over. To the point where she'd hurt herself for me. I'd feel immensely sorry afterwards, but I'd still make her do it again. (Sick I know...) I don't know if I want the feeling of being the hero or what, but this has become somewhat of a must for me...

I've read a lot of 'help', nobody feels the way I do. I might consider myself in a somewhat critical state of emotion right now, as I feel too sad to leave the house, or even my room. Please help me...

"All types of depression fucking suck. Mine feels like a daily battle and a war of attrition. But what I really want in life is to love someone again or to make people laugh.  Will you go look in your mirror (or use the camera on your phone) and just make a silly face or a smile, please? For one depressed person to another? (Don't take a picture or anything). Just make a silly face or smile.  I understand if you don't want to and no need for an explanation, but you are physically able to do so. Love to you all.",5
"I'm using a new account because I can't remember my old password for my main account. But yeah I'm probably dead tonight. Im 20 and moved from the East coast to St Louis about 5 months ago ( it feels longer ). I got a good job delivering but quit it almost two weeks ago because I'm a bitch and was having an anxiety attack.

 I don't know what's wrong with me. A bit before quitting I went into the er because I was suicidal and spent 4 days trapped and with no actual help. I faked being better to get out. My only friends were at this job and they're mad at me ( understandably ). My old roommates are holding some of my stuff hostage until I pay them a certain amount of money. 

I've been couch surfing for the entire time up here. This was stupid. I hate myself. Sorry if it's not making too much sense I can't think straight right now. It doesn't matter either way.",2

"You know, because people who have it sussed it go to parties and celebrate the new year whereas I re-watch a favourite movie or tv series at 11:30 so I can avoid midnight. ",5
"Okay, so here is the entire situation.

Growing up my 24M brother was bullied horribly by his peers and even at home my Dad was like your typical Asian dad and would be strict with him as he did not get good grades.

My dad would often say that he did not care if my brother had serious health issues so long as he got good grades and never gave him any freedom be it being up late or getting up a bit late in the morning.

Hence I became his only source of comfort and he used to talk to me and make me laugh.

Now with me, I had a pretty sociable personality and without blowing my trumpet can say that I was pretty and had excellent grades and because of this my dad was very lenient to me and gave me freedom.

Now my brother when he was 16 and I was 13 came to me with a weird request. He said he was already name called and did not want people taunting him that his little sister was ahead of him even at dating and hence wanted me to put off dating till we passed high school.

He said at that time that he knew his request was unreasonable but told me that since I was going to be pretty and would have guys asking me out and once I turned 18 or 19, he would help me out in my selection ( with my choice being a priority ) and would also in the meantime come out of his shell.

I flatly refused and said that I wanted to date a boy ( whom he had never even seen ) and experience HS life

That's it.

He stopped talking to me from that day and I never made that much of an effort.

After my first break up, I was asked out by the most popular by of HS who I later realized was the ringleader of the group of the gang that targeted my brother.

I promptly broke up with him and apologized to my brother who said that it further reinforced of his feelings of detest he had of me.

His says that ever since I started going out, his bullying increased even further and he felt that I had put my social life ar more than his comfort

He moved out when he turned 18 and could not make anything of his life,

He has since then been depressed, angry and had had trouble getting up in the morning and stay outside of the house for more than hour or two,

My dad cannot bear the humiliation that his own son is a bum started taunting him as a shameless loser and this made him get a part time job

He lives alone in a damp dingy apartment and my father and me pay him money per month and he also earns from part time job.

Now I THOUGHT once school life is over, He would help me out, talk to me and have the same relationship as before

BOY was I wrong.

He wants nothing to do with both me and my father, He says that bar financial help, he does not even want to look at me and feels that both me and my dad have screwed his life up.

He says that to me he admits he is being a bit unfair, but says that he always wished I had heeded to his request and maybe postponed of my dating life.

I thought after 4 years of non-contact time would have healed his wounds but boy he still cannot get over it. I could easily cut of his financial supply and have thought of this option so the he atleast can come live with me but did not go through with this.

HE SAYS he will never talk to me and forgive me and my dad even when we turn 50 and would not even COME TO MY DAD'S BURIAL if and when he passes away.

Says he regrets having a younger sis and wished for atleast an elder sis or a younger brother.

I do not know what to do as I was okay with cutting of for 4 years but cannot stay away for another year or 2. Do I cut him off financially and let him suffer ( atleast he would understand How I help him)

Also My dad too does not care and considers him a major failure",4
"I seriously don't know what is wrong with me.

The best way that I could describe it is 2 tracks are constantly playing in my head. One that is normal and happy. I have lots of friends. I have a good job lined up and am doing very well at university. This track sends out lots of positive emotions and appreciates life.

But for the last 2 years theres another track that CONSTANTLY talks about how every single thing is meaningless. A gorgeous sunset? Life is meaningless, there is no purpose to anything. Having a good time with friends? Life is meaningless. The best way that I ccould describe it is like a stone lodged in your shoe that you have no way to remove, and you have to go on a 50 mile hike.

Well I've had enough. There have been times when I have a respite and I feel normal. But they last a couple hours, a couple days at max.

I don't htink I have depression since I think a lot of positive things often, am not socially isolated or anything like that. In fact when I read the stories of people who are depressed or anxious I ENVY them. Because they seem to be upset about something concrete. Like they feel inadequate. They are scared what others will think of them. They are scared of things IN THE REAL WORLD. But whatever is bogging down is so frightening because there is no concrete root. I couldn't care less what people think of me. There's nothing in the real world that totally takes over my mind, because no matter WHAT i am thinking about, always what is playing in the back of my head is ""this is pointless, this is pointless, this is pointless...""

But clearly there is something very chemically wrong with my brain and I just cannot take it anymore. I dream of going to the doctor and finding that I have a terminal illness, so that it will end and I will finally be free of the rock.",3

"**Trigger warnings for probably everything.**

For me, 2017 has been the shittest year for a while. It can go fuck itself. 

So, for one night only. I'm going to get drunk and direct all of the vitriol and negativity I usually spend on myself, at an entire year. From January to December. It can all get fucked. All of the darkest thoughts I have about me and others. For tonight, they're all for you, 2017.

I hope you'll all join me in posting the nastiest things you can think of about yourself or anyone. And direct it at 2017. Tonight, it deserves it more than you. Normal self-loathing service can be resumed tomorrow. It's gonna get dark.

* 2017, I hope you die in a house fire.
* 2017, if you ever have kids. I hope they get abducted.
* 2017, I hope you get not-quite terminal cancer in all of your toilet-parts and then get hooked on painkillers and end up selling your arse for heroin money as your family and friends look on and laugh.
* 2017, I hope all of your loved ones die in a car crash.
* 2017, you're not worthy of kindness.
* 2017, you deserve nothing.
* 2017, I hope you get pregnant and both you and your baby die in labour.
* 2017, I hope your dog stops loving you.
* 2017, I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. In fact the only time I'd even consider giving you any fluids is if you were in a burns unit, burnt from head to toe. I'd have a wank on you. And that's only if I had AIDS.

Lastly, fuck you, 2017. In a few hours you'll be dead. And I'll still be here. Even though I don't really want to be. I still beat you. And that counts for at least ...something. Probably. Maybe.

 every day I get a little more pathetic,0
"Like I often think that depression isn't a disability and I'm always in amazement when I am actually aloud to take time off of work from it. But I think that way because depression is only in your mind(?). While there's people out there are legitimately disabled through loss of limbs, MS, Rheumatoid Arthritis, cerebral palsy, etc etc etc!

Even though depression isn't a direct physical disability, I just can't pull myself to keep myself going.

I've been kicked the shit out of this holiday with bursted pipes in my house, 2 ""friends"" excommunicating me but right now I've been having a slew of car problems. My battery is constantly dead, my tire flattened out yesterday and my air compressor isn't working... It is just completely locking me down to worthlessness. I don't even have the energy to do anything about this and I'll probably be getting called for work soon.. It just makes me want to take stress leave because I just can't tolerate anything anymore..

"i feel like absolute trash and my depression and anxiety are completely controlling me and i have zero control over them. i don't *want* to kill myself but i can't help but think i would be better off dead. everything is just too hard. i'm 26, will turn 27 this coming year, and i live at home and don't have a college degree. i have a part-time job and struggle to even get through 4 hour shifts. so i don't make enough money to do anything but attend work basically and smoke some cigarettes. i have 1 or maybe 2 ârealâ friends but i don't see them often because i isolate in my depression. i know my family is so disappointed and fed up with me. i'm also struggling with a severely broken heart from an on-and-off 10 year thing and i'm realizing now that this person wants nothing to do with me in their life even though i love them more than anything.

i don't know how to get myself out of this rut. i go to therapy weekly and see a psychiatrist for meds and nothing is improving my mental state or motivation.

i've been in Partial Hospitalization something like 5 times over the past 4-5 years.

should i just pack a bag and book myself inpatient?",2
"Alone at New Year's Eve. I remembered that my friends were on their sides, partying with their friends, and I'm not even here. I drank a beer earlier to have some sort of fun... but I don't feel like drinking the second one I bought. 

And I felt empty... I took my pocket knife, washed it, and started cutting on my right arm. Strange thing is, I'm right-handed, but I've always cut with my left hand. Now I feel like I'm 16 again.

"What I mean by this, is that they care to hear how you're doing and stuff, and they do care of your existence. For example, if you fall ill, they may say something like ""Well, I hope ____ feels better soon!"" That kind of thing. But a lot of people don't care about you, they care *of* you. If they aren't the kind of person who talks and listens to you, then I feel like that means they only care of you. I have a bunch of family members who I only talk to when I see them, like on holidays. Those people, unfortunately, don't care about me. They care of me. I feel like there's a difference. I don't know if know if these are warbled depression thoughts, or if I'm just realizing this, but it seems to be the case. I know telling people about depression is usually overwhelming, but I can't help but feel so brushed off. I hate when I tell people stuff like ""I'm not feeling too well lately, and my life has gotten pretty rough,"" and they'll simply dismiss it with an ""Oh, okay.""

I felt so betrayed and stupid so I guess I have a hard time opening up to people. But I do have friends.. i think. Well not very close but people I can have friendly and nice conversations and chats with!

"Like most everyone in this subreddit I suffer from depression I've been dealing with since I was a child now well into my 30's. In spite of it have able been able to get things done like graduating from college even after loosing someone I loved. It was one of the hardest things that I've ever done. However, these past few years have been really pushing my limits. I won't go into details but things are bad and I need to be learning new skills on the side as my job may not be as secure (thought I don't even like it). That way at least if I do lose my job I can be working in a different field.

I can't seem to be able to muster enough focus/energy to even get started. There were only 2-3 things that helped me to deal with my depression (non drug related) but now I can't seem to get any enjoyment out of them anymore. I have always felt that since I've dealt with depression for such a long time I would always find a way to function. This no longer the case and I'm at a crucial time where that weight I feel on my back can't be interfering with what I have to do. So to those of you out there on the same crappy boat how do you maintain enough function to get thru the things you have to do? 

A little background on me: I have zero friends as the one or two I did have turned out weren't the people I thought they were. I take care of an elderly parent. I don't have the most stable life as I've had to move a lot. Thank you for any advice you might be able to provide. ",4
Anyone tried it for Depression? ,3
"Today I turned 40.  I'm supposed to have this life things pretty figured out, right?  not at all.

I'm alone, a recluse, a hermit.  I go out a few times every week to get groceries, but only at night when I have an easier time walking with less traffic and people inside the store.  That's the extent of my real human interaction. ""Hi, thanks, have a good day"".

I'm too frightened to make many changes to my life, even though I desperately need to.  Two years ago I tackled my drinking problem, that's solved and lost a bunch of weight. I figured i'd try and improve myself, do what I could first before asking for help.
I went crazy for a bit and threw out old stuff i'd been saving, like probably half of what I owned. My house has no furniture and everything is empty/barren, except for my one bedroom.

Now on antidepressants and seeing a psychiatrist.  I'm not sure how effective they are. I think they might help me focus a bit better on things i'd rather be focused on, but it's subtle.  I tried implying something more might be going on... or that I needed more help but my psychiatrist just seems fine with giving me SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics... just treating for depression/ocd... he doesn't seem interested in much beyond the norm and has never clearly come out and told me what my diagnosis was despite seeing him for like 6 months.

I've been unemployed for 2 years.
I have never driven a car.  I'll never have a family.
I'm not even sure i'll ever get another job. I don't feel like a person.

I struggle to do what's required for basic survival these days.
Lately i've been overeating and oversleeping.  I know it, I know how to prevent it by tracking calories and being mindful but like everything it's all so much work.

It's just difficult to see the point to any of this. My current plan of doing nothing is obviously not sustainable and not good for me... I just am unwilling to do anything about it.

If I get through another day without drinking, and manage to keep my house clean or did some other productive thing I try and say it's okay that I did good, but it's difficult cause I can say that however many times I want in my head and believe it but at the same time I still feel like I failed at life.  

I got no idea what to do.  Sell the house, move to the phillippines for a few years?  Just keep the status quo until they kick me out?  Get a job at Walmart or call center?  I dunno.  I got to do something different.  I wouldn't mind if someone just handed me a life in already good-working order and said ""here, trade up"".  I got no idea what a life that makes sense even looks like anymore.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is, I like just putting it down somewhere I guess and if people respond how they like that's okay too.

tldr; it's fine not to read it's just me babbling and mostly for myself anyhow.  maybe someone else can get something out of it.",3
"I've had suicidal thoughts from a very young age and have never felt able to tell anybody about them because, realistically, there's no reason I should be depressed. So many people have it so much worse than I do and it makes me feel like my emotions are invalid, and that if I were to actually acknowledge them to someone else it would seem like I'm being dramatic and attention-seeking. At this point I wish I could just give my life to someone else who actually has it bad because it feels like I'm wasting it. ",5
"After having gained some optimism back and starting to be a bit more positive, here it comes again an ocean of sadness that waves over me. Thoughts circulating around my brain at what seems to be at light-speed.

It's crazy how you can think and feel this is by far the lowest point of my life, it can't get any lower, and then a lower point comes along sooner or later that makes you reflect ""wow how can this be lower then that time? ""How much lower can the human mind and heart tolerate before it caves in?"" 

I'm on my 4th. Honestly i'm actually impressed i'm still here somehow.

Of all my 30 years of living this is has been the most educational and informative year of life ever, the year that taught me all the truths of life and humanity.

Are humans completely selfish by design? Or is this a product of centuries of brainwash by society? Humans by nature are selfish and competitive but it's more of a survivor defense mechanism than anything, I think all the rest of the cruel values and selfishness that has been brainwashed into humanities minds and hearts is definitely a product of the masses. I especially know this since I use to be one of them, utterly brainwashed, hurting others never realizing it or the extent. But thankfully I always in the depths of my heart had that urge, that desire to be a better human being programmed into my heart even in the bigoted ways of my past.

Everybody lies, EVERYONE LIES. When I say that I don't mean 100% I mean 80% the majority who far outweigh the few people you can run into who are apart of that other 20%, meaning it's almost invisible. Even that neighbor with his kids, loving wife, who wakes at 5am everyday to drink his coffee and goes to work, who smiles at you when he sees you in the morning and asks ""how you are?"" and bids a ""good day"" to you is some selfish prick who believes, who teaches and preaches these terrible values to his family thinking it's normal, it's alright, ""we're the good ones"", ""we should be proud for being such upstanding citizens"" even that guy is a total selfish evil prick that goes blind to most of societies eyes.

I don't know how to live with myself anymore, I've tried for months to figure out a way to want to continue to live in what I know and feel.

How can I integrate back into society knowing how they treats others? The racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality, how they treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism, nationalism, religious discrimination, linguistic discrimination, neurological descrimination. How most women treat most men now, they're all evil. How transgender people treat cisgender people because ""they could never understand"" whelp they treated us this way so now ""stfu"" your cis you have no say you ""evil cis!"" It's nothing but hate one way or the other, even the person fighting for what's right is doing it by doing something so wrong, even if the person is good in your eyes there's something dark and fucked up about them.

I'm no saint but everyday I self-reflect, everyday I look at how I can improve as a human, I can do wrong and I can hurt, but I have the self-awareness to listen to my fellow human and learn from it and be better, to see my faults, where I can improve, because I can't stand the thought of a stranger hurting because I had something to do with it directly or indirectly.

Let's pollute, let's kill our planet, let's have plastic surgery for non-medical reasons, let's hurt animals, let's make MORE AND MORE AND MORE MONEY, let's bully in real life and on the internet, let's have privilege, let's eye for an eye, because if we suffered in the past I guess than those who oppressed should suffer now, even the innocent ones, so you're fucked if you're a man, or you're white, or you're Christian, or Jewish, or cisgender, or bisexual, or or or or or or. Let's not be educated, let's think we learned so much and enough, we shouldn't have to be taught better anymore, because ""we know better"".

Why is there so much risk to living a new day everyday even if you're mildly successful?

If I'm bisexual, my sexuality will probably get dismissed left and right all day.

If i'm gay I better not be somewhere like Lithuania.

If i'm transgender, well i'll have to look over my shoulder and fear for my life 68% of the time while never being taken seriously as my gender.

If i'm cisgender, well you better get use to the fact you're ""evil"" because I guess I had a conventional upbringing.

If i'm religious, well that's all hocus pocus now, you're beliefs are secondary to mines!

If you're unattractive, best get use to the idea you'll never get taken completely seriously, you'll have to work and prove yourself 20 times more to other people and probably still not get as good as a opportunity.

If you're a woman, hope you love that unequal salary and being slut-shammed for wearing a skirt or shorts one size too small and tight.

If you're shorter than 5'7, good luck in the dating world, HA good luck getting that job because statistically taller people are hired more and valued more.

If you have tattoos, get ready for those stereotypes and awkward looks of judgement.

If you're ""fat"", GUESS WHAT YOU'RE LAZY.

If you're too skinny, remember women love fits guys and men love voluptuous ladies!

If you're not making at least 100K, might as well die, you're like that crap that went on clearance at a dollar store nobody wants and will go salvage.

If you're bi-polar, have ptsd, depressed, on the spectrum and many of the other frequent and normal neurological conditions everyone suffers normally daily in society, all those immensely gorgeous models, those intellectually genius people, all those successful and wealthy people who have those conditions, no one bats an eye to them, because if you have an issue and your worth doesn't translate to instant money, well you're just a fucked up person, a waste. 

Doesn't matter if you came from a violent background, homelessness, starvation, pain, a violent family, a history of prejudice. The older you are the more you better have your shit together! Because money, looks, degrees, that shit is just handed to you like bubblegum from a candy dispenser apparently.

Fuck you for telling me it'll get better, you mean if I somehow manage another week, or year, or 2 or 3 without fucking completely losing it mentally and going insane or offing myself because that's how psychological distress works, it gets the best of you.

It'll get better alright, when a gosh damn existential miracle happens that magically makes most people not shit even when they're ""good people"" who ""mean well"", when i'm not oppressed every damn waking second because I had no freaking say in my birth!

EAT IT BITCH SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. Thank you humanity you have passed a beautiful legacy to our society. The hippies of back then had it all right, peace and love all ya'll. But those hippies were just a bunch of potheaded wastebags and their little mantra didn't translate to selfishness and money.

Thank you so much.",1

"I have extremely high standards when it comes to soulmates and partners, in fact, I've such high standards, me being 20 years old 
 I never had a girlfriend, and yes, I am extremely good with people; I can tell almost immediately who's who just by looking at them and conversing for a few minutes, and no, I'm not socially awkward, nor do I have social anxiety. A few days ago I saw perhaps the most perfect, and the absolute ideal soulmate in a video on youtube I've ever seen in my lifetime, and no she isn't super-famous or super-rich or anything, she's a starter youtuber. If you know a thing called ""internal checklist"" that you have for the perfect partner to fit under, appearances, personal traits, perhaps manners, the way they dress, their ""own world"" etc, not only was mine fully filled, it also has extras, AND she's single. Sadly, this isn't a story with a happy ending. She has a social anxiety, I've no way to get in touch with her, nor would I want to make her uncomfortable by being a random creep who follows her around, does research on emails /contact info etc, I'm not thinking about myself in this case because she purposefully hid her email address from youtube as well as contact info and I won't try to obtain it. I did try to look her up on facebook, and she hid everything from public, hence proving that it'll just make her even more uncomfortable if some random unknown freak sends her a random email to an address that shouldn't've been discoverable by public. This glass effect is SO bloody painful; I can see her, I hear her talk, yet she will never know about my existence, we will never meet, and never look at one another in real life, ever. It is new year's eve today, and I literally just feel like going back into my maths [I'm studying compsci] and not getting out of the world of mathematics for the next 3 months, I feel HORRIBLE, just so damn empty, tired, somewhat broken, especially when I realize that such people (for me I mean) probably will come up once every 20 years, judging by my past years. Obviously not suicidal, but my fucking god, I've never felt such a strong soul pain. I know it might sound cringy, and I'm sorry about that, I've just never felt this pain before. And if this is love at first sight, why in oblivion is it glorified so much? This pain is just so damn unbearable, especially knowing that I may, perhaps either end up being alone because such people are **ridiculously** rare, or marry someone just for financial stability, which most likely won't be the case for me; money means nothing if there are no feelings. 

Anyways, thank you for reading this long ramble, I'll try my best to recover and just, sort of move on, although I know that periodically I'll probably get dragged back to this person. *sigh*",4
"New year's coming around and Iï¸ really just want to say thank you to all of you. Iï¸ still have a long way to go, but reading posts on here and getting feedback from real people has helped much more than anyone can think. I've been to multiple therapists but none of them have been as helpful as this. We're all so broken but have so much care within us. It makes me so happy to see us all try to put each other back together even at our lowest of times. Once again, Iï¸ really do thank you guys, a bunch of strangers caring when you don't have to; and Iï¸ hope 2018 is a better year than 2017 for all of us.",4
"Hi, I'm Jake. I'm from England where it's currently 00:06 and I'm not sure why I'm writing this but I guess I need to put my thoughts somewhere (like a diary of sorts.)
I've felt dreadful for about 3 years now, progressively getting worse to the point of hating every fibre of my being. I've never really spoken to anyone about my thoughts or feelings, so maybe I'm not depressed, maybe it's normal to feel like this, but something tells me it isn't.
However, I am not here for sympathy. I'm writing this because I intend to turn my life around in 2018, I want to lose weight, put more work into university, maybe pick up some hobbies and TRY to be more social. So I intend to return to this post in 3 months or 6 months or a year when I've hopefully managed to change my life for the better, and I hope YOU can do the same, whoever you are, wherever you are.

I hope you have a fantastic year, god bless you.

"Hey all,

Normally I try to muscle through these kinds of things on my own, but I'm having a rough go of things at the moment. Figured I'd make a post about it here and see what input some people have for me. I'm currently a 19 y/o ""sophomore"" in college, approaching what should (in theory) be my last semester at my local school before transferring to a 4-year school next fall. I'm now getting to the back end of my gen-eds, and one of the biggest reasons I went to a community college was to hopefully figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Coming out of high school and just picking a major seemed eternities away from anything I was capable of knowing, so I went the ""play it safe"" route.

I just feel as if I'm approaching a time where a decision needs to be made and I'm seriously bummed out about it right now. I've been all across the map as far as majors/program considerations are concerned, wanting to be a police officer through most of high school---&gt;being an English teacher---&gt;doing something with computers and IT----&gt;wanting to do film? As if now, I'm pretty certain that being a police officer/teacher are no longer of interest to me, but I'm juggling the most between computers and film of all things.

I've seen some older forum posts echoing similar sentiments, but really I'm just paralyzed with fear about making the wrong move. I'm generally pretty proficient with computers, but I have my doubts that I'd be able to keep up with the higher-level math requirements that come along with such a degree. I also wouldn't want to be a software dev or do coding really, and networking sounds boring to me. I just don't know of a sustainable career path that deals with troubleshooting hardware/software.

As far as film goes, I just really like video editing. Would pursue cinematography or something to that effect. With this one in particular I'm really concerned with being able to find work out of college, because so often we hear that these ""fine art"" esque degrees are a big no-no if you want job security and that's really important to me. Film school is also expensive so you have to be pretty grounded in your decision to attend. Despite the fact that I am not really cut out for a STEM related field (I've always performed better in liberal arts classes) I feel like I'd never find work.

This past semester I decided I'd not concern myself with gen-eds as much (only took Bio to get it out of the way) and have the rest be electives. In my case, I took two CIS classes (stands for Computer Information Systems), which were okay, but felt a lot like ""how to use microsoft office"" classes. Not necessarily super representative of the entire field. I even took a career class to get some more insight into potential paths. Helped a little bit but not as much as I envisioned it would.

Sorry for the essay. Bottom line is I just feel like the clock is ticking and I'm feeling seriously depressed and anxious. I can't stop thinking about it. Everyone seems to be finding a path that works for them, grinding out their coursework, while I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks. I feel like I'll never get to where I need to be :(

Thanks for reading this and taking the time to respond, if you decide to. Any and all feedback is seriously appreciated, I'm sure I could use it. Have a great evening everybody and happy NYE.",2
"I'm crying my eyes out

"This past year has been amazing in terms of working on my mental illness. The past month or so (Holidays are the worst for me since I don't talk to my family.) I've been really going up and down. I have bipolar disorder, PTSD and anxiety in addition to my depression. The other voice in my head is back. It keeps telling me horrible things.. I logically understand that this is just a downtime for me and that it'll pass eventually, even if it takes weeks; but I feel like I'm so tired. I'm tired of fighting with myself. I hate this world we live in, my two best friends are only great for shallow socializing. They don't understand my diseases and I just isolate myself for weeks at a time because I have no one to turn too. My roommate is fantastic, he's always been there for me but I can see how much it wears him down. I'm tired of being a burden. 

I've always pushed people away and I really just want to disappear. I don't want to exist anymore. I'm just so so so so so exhausted of fighting my illnesses. I'm tired of constantly fighting an uphill battle. I think it might be time for me to leave this world, if not now then soon.

I think what really, really makes me angry is that I know I'm acting irrationally, it's like the real me is forever trapped inside a glass, sound-proof box screaming that it'll be okay and watching myself lash out in anger. I'm watching myself isolate myself from the people I care about and I can't do anything about it. It's like watching my own demise, like watching myself drive off a cliff. 

Happy New Year I guess....",5
"This year especially. I joined a D&amp;D group this year trying to make friends but they all don't like me or idk because none of them want to be friends. Anyways, they've been texting each other in our group chat (which we have when we need to ask questions like find out if everyone is good to play on our set days) for the past few days about having a New Years party. Everyone but one person said they'd be up for it (the one person was busy)...but they never asked me. They asked everyone else. Never mentioned me, asked how I was, if I could make it, if I wanted to come...nothing.

Party is tonight. Early this morning (like 1-2 am), I get a text from the DM asking about my back (I threw it out a while ago and have been in constant pain), I was thinking ""oh ok this is where he asks if I'm coming.""...yeah no. Just asked about my back, I said it was slightly better since I've been resting and he said something like ""Oh that's good.""...that's it.

And still no one asking about me in the main chat.

It hurts being excluded like that. I can only assume they did it because I don't drive, thus I can't really get to said party or get back home without someone else driving me...but they could at least offer or ask why I've been quiet or anything! It's the thought that counts...just them thinking about me would have made it easier.

This is just cruel. I'm not looking forward to our next game when I have to be around them...",4

"//depressive rant
My friends always ask me why I never hang out with them. Not all the time, but whenever I do actually go out with friends it always comes up at one point. Yet nobody actively invites me to things. Sometimes they do, it seems random sometimes I don't particularly have one main group of friends. 

Honestly this is because I'm afraid. I'm afraid that if I actively tried to hang out with people, I'd end up scaring them away. I've kept myself locked up for years, because I always relied on people to invite me, rather than me planning it out/asking to join along. 

I'm not friendless, but I convince myself I am. I would sit in my house for a week, with my only social contact would be at work, and I'd get depressed. I'd feel lonely, feel like I have no friends, nobody to talk to. Yet people message me almost every day. I get invited to things occasionally, and some people have told me that I can hit them up if I ever want to hang out. But I never do. Not unless they invite me. I fucking hate myself.

//actual post

I didn't try today. I know I could have hit someone up, but I didn't. Someone asked me what I was doing today, told them I didn't know, they told me I should get fucked up with them. Never happened. I didn't even fucking try. Now I'm sitting at home, high as a fucking kite, have had a nasty anxiety attack the entire day, I'm fucking sick of it. My girlfriend is at work so I can't actually do shit. So fuck it. I'm getting high and playing video games, because fuck me.

EDIT: Since I'm high and on the self hate train that I'll have to clean up tomorrow, might as well go deeper because fuck it. I love how I paint this ugly picture and believe it's real. I always make myself lower than everyone else, and I never cut the bullshit even when I realize it's bullshit. I love how I fucking realize all the anxiety in my head, yet I let it get to me anyways. I should be better than this.",4

"Last year at this time, I was working in tech support being yelled at by people I don't know.  This year, I have a terminally ill family member and I'm struggling to find a place to live as I'm being kicked out of my old place.  This is compounded by the fact that the city I work in has no available apartments at the start of Jan/Feb.  The next closest city is about 100km away (an 1 hour+ drive).  

I've no idea what to do anymore.  Every day I wake up feeling sicker and sicker, my head is just full of clouds, I can't find my knife that I usually use to relieve the pressure (I suspect one of my friends stole it once they realized what it was for).  I'd ask for a hug, but I'm terrified of contact with people and it would just make me feel worse.  

It feels like there's a noise in my head that's just getting louder and louder, like someone turning up the volume on a TV station that's nothing but static.  People keep telling me how impressed they are by how smart I am, but I only look smart compared to those who don't actively reject everything that's supposed to make them feel like a person.  Academic medals mean nothing to someone who isn't human.

"Hi everyone. I just wanted to clear something up. Two months ago, my mild symptoms had started and progressively got worse. About a month ago, I was moderately depressed but a video triggered what I thought was euphoria in me. I have experienced moderate anxiety episodes before. At first, it didn't feel like it, I felt realllly good, but then I thought, ""I haven't felt like this, my heart is racing, this must be anxiety"" and then it changed to another anxiety episode. I think it lasted for an hour and a half. So, my question is, has anyone experienced this euphoria along with depression? I'm consulting a psychiatrist, but I feel guilty about calling her up all the time.",3

"I know tonight is supposed to be a good one but I'm having a hard time shaking the thoughts of just pulling the plug. The thought of going through yet another year in poverty, loneliness, hatred and sadness is almost too much for me to bear.

I'm 23 years old, I've never had a girlfriend, I've barely had any sex to speak of, I work minimum wage shitty jobs, I have no friends, no family to speak of, and no young woman even close to my age seems to want anything to do with me. I get degraded by other men for not having had enough sex, not seeming masculine enough, and while I understand men are supposed to be strong, few people understand that men have feelings too.

It's like my life is some nightmare I can't wake up from. I look young for my age, and while I've been through so much and so many difficult experiences, people only see an 18 year old kid when they look at me. Girls assume I am naive and immature and look the other way, guys assume I'm a pussy. I get nothing, because apparently I am nothing, at least to the naked eye.

My parents are both 61 and may die before I even find happiness in my life. But honestly I want to die first.  ",1

"Well, I am new to the Reddit app. I have been learning and researching about depression,anxiety, and many other mental disorders. But what I have came across is summarizing,paraphrasing,emotional intelligence, and emotional balance. Please consider reading this post. I have done a good amount of research. If someone has done research(science included) and want to share his/her opinion, they are scientifically correct because if you have science to defend your theory/opinion/idea/thesis/conclusions you are correct.

To start off,summarizing and paraphrasing is the most important thing when researching/investigating because that way you'll learn anything with 100% perfect clarity. In order to paraphrase and summarize you simply have to put what you have read and seen in your words. Summarizing and paraphrasing is scientifically proven the best way to learn anything.

Emotional Intelligence(EQ) or (EI) is the ability to take control of your emotions and also being able of controlling others emotionally such as intimidating someone, scaring someone,dominating someone, and so on. Emotional Intelligence is the skill of taking control of your emotions and by taking control of your emotions you will not let fear,panic,depression,anxiety,anger,shyness,nervousness control your mind. Always maintain your mind under control. EQ is much more important than IQ(intelligence).

There are many articles on the internet claiming they can cure social anxiety, and other mental disorders, but in reality is much more complex than simply saying things like; Be more open to people, be confident, talk to girls. All of these tips/advises are nothing but helpless information for people with different mental disorders(same as mental illness).

Does the feeling of emptiness ever go away? Or will I actually like myself at some point?,5
I'm still able to do daily tasks but my minds  all ways blank when I do them when I do think it's usually a long thought about deppressing stuff or it's quick thoughts. Sometimes I get the urge to choke myself with my hands and one time I scratched myself very hard and the next day a scab formed where I scratched. I don't feel depressed except when I have long thoughts but I know when your depressed you sometimes don't feel anything.,3

To help me understand why I am the way I am. To help me stop lashing out in anger at my friends cause i keep thinking they hate me. 
I'm currently not seeing any sort of professional but in the next month I plan on seeing a counselor, or at least have some sort of screening. I really need help, i don't have any where else to turn to. I wanna stop doing this to my friends, they don't deserve this and I sure as hell don't deserve them. I wanna be happy with them again and hang out with them again. I wanna stop hating myself and I want to stop being paranoid all the god damn time.

"First off i have been suffering with depression for more 4 years now but i have not seen a therapist. Its has been intermediate with me wanting to do things then not. But now i am in bad shape, i have completely lost track with every one in my life. I cant do simple task anymore. I suffer from insanely bad mood swings, for instance i was just on my computer playing games then 5 minutes later i had 10+ painkillers hoping that i would die in my sleep that night. I now dont eat much at all and i stay up until about 5:00 am each night. I am starting to get suicidal thought more and more recently. I have also gone back to cutting my self. I hate myself. Im just a fat piece of s*** in high school that im the butt end of every joke. I dont want to be made fun of anymore, When i do go to a friends house my parents make fun of me because they think im a nerd that hangs out with other nerds. I am just tired of all of this. I want it to end. Im a failure to my parents, my friends, my self. I have started to not talk to any of my friends. I know it would help to talk to them but they don't understand anything i say. They just say âHaHa Sameâ ironically. They think im joking but im not, my hole life has become a joke for others. Its hard for me to just get the motivation to get up on a weekend. I just sit in my room starring and thinking on how and when i will die.

"Posted on this /r/sexuality and I want to post it here since this subreddit is more active.
--

I am a male and I'm 19, I go to college. I have never been happy and content in my life, severe depression that's been on for 4+ years is one of the root causes. Depressed because I have no intimate interactions with females, who I am absolutely attracted to. Three ago I started experiencing thoughts that I would truly find happiness if I were born a female and I don't really know how I find solute in that thought - maybe because of my limited experience with women, but I do not know for sure.

I lost my virginity after two days of my 18th birthday to a hooker and I didn't even get to finish. I've only hooked up with one girl when I was 17 and that included only making out and that was it, apart from those two experiences I have other sexual experience whatsoever.

I need some help to understand my own self and why I feel this way, maybe it's because I need to get more experience with women? (Which is another problem.)

Reddit please help",4
"I really want to stop myself from watching porn..

I'm a 19 years old girl, never been with a guy, only with a woman. I consider myself bisexual. I've been watching porn since 9 or I think much more younger than that. 

I grew up on a terrible family. During nights when I was young I always hear my Mother and Father having sex, worst even if I'm sleeping beside them. Sometimes, I think it is a make up sex that theyre are doing..

When I was young, I really had a thing with older men. Ive been groped a lot of times.. and the worst thing is that I actually enjoy it. It made me feel arouse when someone is groping me and I dont know why. That's why in porn, I'm being aroused as well with groping or.. force or worst gang sex whatever they call that. I used to masturbate and still masturbating for it.  I dont know why am I so into it even if I know that porn industry is evil and I dont ever want to be raped. I dont want casual sex as well.. but still I find myself masturbating to it and being so aroused by it. 


That's one of the things that depressing me. I want to stop myself from masturbating, I want to stop myself from watching porn.. thing is now, I'm on a long distance relationship and she's into kinky stuff.. i just dont know what to do anymore

"Hi everyone. Hope you're all hanging in at this difficult time of the year. 

I've had depression since I was about 13, and I'm still struggling to live with it. I had a really shitty year last year. Both my childhood dogs died over the space of 5 months, I only had a few clients as a freelancer and I lost them after falling into depression through it. Since my second dog died, I've lost 14kg (30lbs) - I now weigh just 50kg (110lbs) and I'm really struggling to find the appetite to put some weight back on. I'm 25, single, unemployed, live with my parents (this is at least somewhat normal in my country), and still don't know what I really want to do with my life in terms of a career. This isn't the first time depression has crushed me and set me back with no glimpse of things getting any better. No job prospects, no friends, no money, but I know I'm not alone and there are so many people going through so many similar things right now that are just desperate to get back on track. While every year has slowly gotten worse for me over the last five, I feel like I've earned some perspective from my depression and the mistakes I've made. Depression is a prison. I might be serving a life sentence, but with good behaviour and some rehabilitation, I might be able to leave on parole. I can't think exactly what lead to my acceptance of this sentence but I've never felt this frame of mind before, and now that I do I think I'm ready to start fighting again.

If you've been struggling for years like me, if you want to change, and you know what changes you want to make... I always find myself giving up and looking towards next year as another opportunity to start again, so just do it for yourself because you realise you need to and not because it's a new year and that's what people do. None of them last because they all watch their friends and colleagues fall off the wagon together. It doesn't work. Remember these people don't care about change the way we do. We can't treat this change as callously as they do. Ordinary people want to improve too, sure, but we *need* to improve.

Do it for yourself. Happy (or not) New Year.",2

Been at the tipping point for a while now, although for some reason my death would upset some people so i refuse to do it as much as i want to. Problem is, living in this state is really hard as i feel as though im forced to live.

The advice im after is, what does going to counselling actually do? Because i've sat for numerous hours thinking about it, but can't see any way it would help? Like i don't actually like this world and even if my attitude changed my situation wouldn't, and if anything relying on pure hope to get me through another 50~ years of despair would just be more painful than accepting it?

I *did* when I had the ""luxury"" of health insurance. I'm on my own now, though, and am doing my fucking best. 

It felt like it came out of nowhere, too, when he initiated the call and wanted to hear me participate more in voice with group chats. I'd made jokes about needing time to remember how to speak after so much tension with family, and think he may have gotten the wrong impression. He started offering new employment routes, which, while appreciated, also just overwhelmed me even more. I'd already told him that I technically have two businesses, one teaching guitar and the other gardening. He was offering stuff completely unrelated and out of my field. I'd like to look into them, but I have multiple learning disabilities and mental illnesses over here. It's gonna take time 

I would like to talk to him more about it, but felt I needed to rant and hopefully clear my head. If anyone has suggestions, I would truly appreciate it

"I've posted here a lot over the last year on both this account and others. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a very long time and it felt like things weren't going to get any better. I was giving up. 
However, about 4 months ago I had perhaps the worse mental breakdown In my life. Everything kind of happened at once and I hit rock bottom. I couldn't bring myself to go to work. I spent my days in my room crying. I was angry and miserable. I was a mess. 
Eventually my sister and brother in law came to my aid and pushed me to get better. We found me a new less stressful job away from my triggers. I opened up about my mental illness. I got a new doctor who took interest in my problems and prescribed me medication and guides to conquer them. I started a new job that I really enjoy. I also started dating this guy that has gone through some of the same struggles and understands how I feel. 
It's been an incredible 4 months. I know it's not this easy for others but I got lucky. I also want to thank the people who would give me advice. Thanks guys! Happy New Year! ",3
"Hi. First, English is not my first language, so some sentences might be weird. I post here because there's no other place better than here. People in my country will definitely blame or laugh at me.

I thought I was one of those people who are strong enough to use social media. I don't care about others are having fun or eating in good restaurants, or bought luxury stuffs or have partners. 

But recently after I saw one of my old classmates becomes a professional translator and another becomes a writer who have published 2 novels, I start to doubt that. I feel uncomfortable. And I'm uncomfortable for feeling uncomfortable, because they were my friends. I feel awful. I don't know why. I feel shame. I think that although I have been knowing that I'm a loser, but it feels so much different when you see the real distance between you and others. It hurts.

A lots of people here suggest that it's better to just delete social medias. But that somehow makes me feel awful too. It's like, if I did it, it means I officially admitted I can't accept that others are getting successful but I am not. I feel there's a voice in my head laughing at me: ""Hey, look at what you want to do. You feel awful for seeing others being successful, and your way to solve this is, ha, to delete your social media? Instead of getting inspired and start to work hard and get your shit together? You just ganna run away? Pathetic!"".

Some people say ""It's not pathetic, it's for your mental health"" but I still feel pathetic for thinking about that I have to use this way to protect myself.

**Studies :** Studying a long as fuck course with grueling hours. Regretting getting into it. But now no turning back. I'd enjoy it, or be less stressed about it if not for monstrous lecturers. Every morning I wake up thinking what will I get chewed out for today    

**Future :** Bleak. Specially job-wise. Relationships also have been forced so far, in my sad attempts to be a normal person. Marriage and kids don't look like its happening. In my culture this is undesirable. I'm the weirdo  

**Religion :**  Have to fake it. There is no freedom of religion where I am from. Sometimes normal people things make me feel conflicted. In the west its OK for casual sex, drinks etc. Here people do it too, even if they believe in God. Funny thing is, I'm the one with faith issues and yet I'm the one feeling guilty even thinking about these things.   

**Mentality :** I can't bring myself to compromise. I can't be happy if I can't make others happy or proud of me. But doing what makes me happy most likely would make people (family mostly) detest me.

I want to disappear

Everytime I try to conquer this feeling of worthlessness just doesn't work and actually makes it worse. I have nothing. No job or income, no one to love, no properties, and close friends I've had just keep turning their backs on me and making me feel worse as if I never meant anything to them. I just want it to end.

 I don't think I will make it through this new year, not that most people would actually care enough to even notice if I'm gone

I want this suffering to end, I'm slipping deeper and deeper into the thought of ending it all.

I can't do this anymore, nothing motivates me, no one seems to care enough. What's the point of living?",5
"A pragmatic person looks at the practical side of things. Pragmatism is a dispassionate form of common sense.

Take a breath. Take another.

Stop telling yourself that you can't. Stop believing that you can't. I know it hurts. Instead of letting feelings sweep you away, practice approaching them pragmatically.

~Dushka Zapata

.............................................................................................

How can you begin to live my life in a more pragmatic way?

Basically deal with things in a sensible and realistic manner.**Be organised.** It is a simple thing to do and will have the most effective results in every aspect of your life, be it at home, in highschool,college, in your place of work.  A tidy life, will lead to a tidy mind which in turn will lead to you making better decisions when you need to be sharp, alert and on the 'button' when it comes to problem solving and taking action.

**A confession:**

You cry and suffer alone. Nobody is there to help you. There is this form of helplessness that goes from you crying nearly every day, till you realize that nobody is there to hear you. Crying then becomes pointless.

Crying is a distress signal, if the signal isn't answered, it's useless. So what happens? Well, your brain tries to find other ways to deal with suffering. As a result of nobody answering your distress calls, your brain learns over time that every single problem that you'll EVER suffer from for the rest of your life, you must solve alone. Period.

The world has given us the middle finger and said âGoodluck dumbass, you're on your own!â You learn that because nobody was there for you, you become 99.99% reliant on YOURSELF. You are now the only person you can trust. Everyone else means nothing to you. Why care about someone if:

1. They weren't ever there for you, and

2. You've already learned how to be reliant on yourself, you don't need people anymore.

You develop this zenn state where you feel as if you're in a bit of an odd trance, like nothing really matters as much as you think it does and you stop putting emotions into just about anything.

As a result of your abuse, your problems stop feeling like problems. I hypothesize that the reason behind this is because when you were having problems, nobody was there to help you. There was no empathy for you and you were always left solving problems yourself.Eventually you just learn to cope with it by looking for solutions instead of self-loathing and whining about it because whenever they showed signs of distress, nobody was there to pick them up.

Most of the coffee mugs are near the edge, some are even halfway over the edge, always in danger of falling over, all it takes is one false move. Talking to someone new is like putting a new mug right on the edge, half on the table, half over the edge. It's fucking nuts. I can't take those risks, I suck, I know, but I can't. I'm not very interesting (at first at least) or articulate and a lot of people find that annoying. Even talking to people on social networks is scary.

Anyhow, I'm really feeling like I'm not getting anywhere ATM so I'm giving up on the therapy and meds and feel better already but not sure if its too healthy. Anybody else feel like the only choice of happiness is to completely shut the world out and exist only in solitary? ",5
"âThere's a lot of people who want to be in despair, just so they can pity themselves. But I think it's a waste of time, that's all. After all, your the one who wishes to be left alone and refuses to share your pain with anyone else.

Don't just sit on your ass, waiting for somone to give you a job. It's common sense for a person to go out in the world and work his ass off no matter how much problems he has! Yet you pretend the rest of the world has nothing to do with you and just laze around with a face that might as well belong to a corpse...! All you do is whine, whine, whine! Always whining about how you don't want to be a slave to society, or how shit the job market is! Back in our day, people worked to the bone in far harsher conditions than you can imagine!!

SO DONT GET COCKY, PUNK!! YOU DONT EVEN CONTRIBUTE A SINGLE THING TO SOCIETY!! NO MATTER WHAT TIMES WE LIVE IN, A WORTHLESS PIECE OF TRASH IS A WORTHLESS PIECE OF TRASH, YOU PASSIVE, LAZY, BUM!â

That's what she said when I opened up about my depression. I guess she is right, though. It's dog eat dog world out there. To not even try because your afraid of failing, is just too pathetic. I should probably just do everyone a favor and kms.",5
"This new year looks like it might be the year I kill myself. I'm so beyond done now.

I am 26, male, and I feel like my life is over. My family financially ruined me to the point where I feel like I shouldn't even bother trying to fix my life. Due to some circumstances I ended up moving to a town I hate living in, and can barely afford. It's in the american countryside. I hate the american countryside. I deeply hate it. I've never enjoyed myself in the country. I also don't drive, so that makes it suck more. That's just venting though. Some more venting, I've been financially supporting my parents for some years to the point of abuse. I've been saving up to buy a car the last year. 3 times I made it to about 3 grand. 3 times they've taken it, once my took it mom bought herself a car instead. Broke down 2 months later too. then her husband had a heart attack. Then they got themselves an eviction notice. I paid the entirety of their rent the last 2 months. I hate them. But. I can't drive, I have no savings, I am stuck in a place I hate living with people I hate living with and I afford it by working a job I hate and I can't do anything about it because I can't drive and I have no savings, no one will help me drive and my parents keep taking my savings. So it's never going to get better. I have no friends. None. Not a single one. Not for about 3 years. I've disowned my family, aside from my mother but If by some miracle I save some money up and can leave, or she dies without leaving my homeless, then I'm done with her too. So. In my heart I've disowned my family and have no desire to ever contact anyone I share blood with for as long as I live. Which probably isn't very long.

I am completely isolated, very socially awkward, financially a failure. Well. Really I'm mostly just a failure. Like, in every way. I feel like I'm the biggest loser in the world. 

It really bothers me that I didn't do this to myself though. It would be so much better if I did this to myself, cause then I could stop it. Or I could at least take responsibility. I could have power, even if that power ruined my life it'd be mine. But. I go to work and then I basically give all my money to my mother cause she attacks and threatens me otherwise, I have no support system as I have no friends and no one that can and will actually help me, or offer a realistic answer to my problems. People offer shitty advice that has never worked. Staying positive does nothing for me. I can smile all day but It won't get me a car or put money in my pocket. No one I work with is really ""Friend"" material. I feel myself rapidly approaching 30 where ""friends"" become more irrelevant anyway. I feel like I'm going to die alone cause of it. Like, I'll never be allowed to fix up my life and meet someone. I'll never be allowed to save money. I'll never leave the american countryside that I hate living in oh so much. I really doubt I'll ever have sex again, at this point. 

I wake up everyday and the first thing I want to do is cry cause I hate being alive. Like life is a living hell, there's not a single thing about my life that is the way I actually would like. People tell me to take control without realizing I literally have none no matter how much I try, I can't be homeless cause I'd lose my job and there's no room in shelters cause they have to save so much space for women and they're at capacity with regulars. It's also winter, so I'd probably freeze to death in my area if I have to sleep outside. I want to die, but not like that. I also have no where else to go. Literally no where else. Not a single place in the world, as again, I have no friends or family. I have no power. I have no control. 

People offer advice completely ignorant of the fact that I have no resources. I can't leave the house under my own ability, I can't get up and go whenever to wherever. I also have no privacy when leaving the house cause of that. So outside of going to work I don't really leave. I feel like a prisoner. I have no power, I have no resources.

At this point I really think I should just kill myself. I'm rapidly approaching 30, I'm all alone in the world, I have no savings, my personality isn't anything anyone would enjoy at this point. I'm like broken and hollowed out. Just twisted up inside. I'm really no worthy catch in any department, as a friend or more. I often get told I'm handsome though. There's that. It's pretty worthless too. Like, girls I'm attracted too will tell me I'm attractive but my personality sucks too much for it to help. I get looks or fuck me eyes occasionally, no one really talks to me though. I was good with girls when I was younger. But. I had guy friends that would like, invite me along to places to meet women and then they started to kinda bash me and make me look bad. Like, I was bait, and a set up; so they could look good and get laid. So. That stopped. Then I self isolated. Then, I had to move. Then life isolated me. I'm in the middle of nowhere and every attempt at making friends has failed. Even meeting people in general, dating sites in my area don't have very many users. Only enough for like 3 pages in a search on POF. It's boring. I hate it. So, there's not a lot to choose from and it's already gone badly. So I'm alone. All alone. 

All alone, in a town I hate, with people I hate, wasting my time on a job I hate that doesn't actually benefit me cause I can't build up savings. I can't save up to drive. I can't save up to leave. I can't get my mother out of my life. I wake up and feel like crying. I feel like crying all day. I feel like crying now. It's like this every day. It's been like this for years now. So, waiting it out is not an option. This won't pass. It's not stopping. Nothings getting better, it's getting worse and worse. I really just can't anymore.

I think it's just time to go ahead and kill myself. I've really struggled and put in serious effort to fix my life, and it's not happening. I'm sick of assholes with bad advice and I am sick of trying.

I'm done. I am quite literally done, actually. This is the end of me.",2
"Hey guys, long story short I've had a long history of depression/anxiety and I was prescribed Effexor towards the first half of the year (around April I think). Initially it lifted my mood, but very quickly it began to take a toll on me. I found that I felt completely disconnected from my actions, like I was a stranger inside my own body, and more worryingly I lost the ability to really feel any emotion. I've had to imitate behaviours and emotions even though I am not feeling them in order to still seem like I'm functioning. The only real feelings I've had as of late have been bouts of anger and a habit of splurging on stuff I don't need and overeating which I never really did before.

My doctors have been extremely unhelpful and I made the decision two months ago to slowly taper off my dosage. I was on 75mg a day, and I began by opening the cases of the pills (there are six small capsules within a plastic shell) and removing one of the capsules, over time ramping it up to only 3 capsules a day, the equivalent of 37.5mg. One day I decided enough was enough. I cannot be held prisoner with this fucking drug anymore, it's too much for me and I long to feel SOMETHING again beyond anger. I quit cold turkey 8 days ago and it's been rough, really rough.

I'm getting a TINY BIT of feeling again. Over Christmas I didn't really feel much at all, but I felt a bit happy the day after Christmas spending time with my family. My sex drive is beginning to return and my dick suddenly works again. 

As for the withdrawal effects, it's been rough as fuck.  I get ""brain zaps"" which is very common for people coming off Efexxor. It's like a sudden jolt in my consciousness and happens anywhere between 20-100 times in an hour. I can handle that though. I'm lethargic and it's hard to move my hands properly. I'm experiencing a lot of hot flushes and high temperature. I'm sweating balls when I sleep and during the day.

Worst of all is I'm getting bouts of extreme anger. Over time I've become a much more chilled person, but this anger I'm feeling does not feel like me at all. I'm convinced it's withdrawal effects. I get so mad I want to scream at full volume and smash everything around me. I've never consistently felt like this even in the past when I struggled with anger. The slightest thing infuriates me and I'm overreacting to everything.

My family have no idea how long I've been struggling. I made the decision a while ago not to bring it up because it only makes things worse. They made it very clear they want to help and share my issues but when I've spoken to them about how I feel in the past it has scared them and they have been over-protective. I choose not to rely on anybody else and I don't have anyone to share how I feel with so I felt like I wanted to make a post here.

I have become distant with all my friends and family. I felt such a disconnect with life in general at the start of the year that nothing really feels real anymore. I don't care about anything, I don't want to make an effort with anybody and I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about how I feel. I don't feel like anyone would understand. I feel like I'm not meant to be here and that I'm defective and people can just sense it when they're with me. Everything seems to superficial and pointless and nothing gives me joy anymore. I have vivid fantasies of pushing everyone I know away and living alone in solitude and never having to contact them again, starting life over. Even though I'm close to my family and have some very good friends, it never feels like enough and I've lost a lot of close friends recently by cutting them out of my life because they were toxic people.

I feel hazy, I'm sleeping bad and it's hard to focus, but I'm 8 days in and no matter how bad it gets I'm staying off these torturous drugs. Think long and hard if Effexor is really for you. It has become a prison for me and online research has shown me that it's the same for others. I am determined to beat the dependence, but I worry about how long I'm going to feel like this. I can handle a few months, but what if it never goes away? I feel incredibly alone in all of this. 

This is a bit of a trainwreck of a post but it feels a little better to put how I feel into some semi-cohesive manner. Has anyone else gone cold turkey and made it? How long did it take?",3
"Hey all,

I've been on Lexapro (generic) for a couple years now, no issues.  Currently 20mg dropping to 15mg tomorrow.

This week I started Wellbutrin XL (generic) at 150mg.  I feel good, little wired, but not bad.

I'm concerned with the possibility of seizures. I've brought this up to my doctor, waiting on a response, but I figured I'd get more opinions.

I have no history of seizures, no plans to go above 150mg.

Any thoughts, am I worried for nothing?

Thanks!",3

"Been having on and off waves of depression since 10th grade and just a total, consistent lack of motivation to put effort into anything. I dropped out of collage after the first semester and now I just work to keep myself afloat mentally. I just don't care enough about anything to get myself moving forward. All my relationships fail because I'm just not emotional and block everything out. New Year's Eve drank myself unconscious and now I'm back to my depressed self and self harming again. I hate myself for not being able to get though it and I'm afraid my life will just be passive and grey. 

I know I'm not alone but I just feel so isolated in myself. I don't talk to anyone about my feeling because I feel like I wouldn't make a difference",2
"Hello everybody.

So, you know those people that don't really have depression but pretend they do? Yeah, this is me. It doesn't mean life is easy for me, everything is still very difficult and was like that for the past 5-6 months. It's just not bad enough to be called depression. Everybody else has it much, *much* worse. I just don't really feel good anymore. And I just know that I'm pretending and I don't really deserve anything because of this. I'm just in this gray zone where it's not bad enough to remotely think about getting any help I don't deserve but not good enough for me to be happy. And everything is just getting worse.

How can I realize that I'm just a really lazy and stupid idiot that has it much better than everybody else but still whines about his life to himself?",0
"I was a quiet weird child who couldn't talk to other kids. My friends were just bullies who abused my kindness and lack of courage. I spent my childhood online because everything was nicer and funner there. So of course i have no friends now and I dont know how to interact with people normally. Being truly alone is more painful and impactful than imaginable for most. I am now bitter and fed up with myself and everyone. I don't enjoy anything anymore, I cant do anything at all without feeling terrible. I cant think anymore my mind is blank I want to take a sledge hammer to my head just to see what's in there. Thatd be stupid though. I don't see a future for myself. I wish it didn't all happen like this, I feel like I never had a chance. abused in childhood never loved by anyone and jealous of everyone who isn't grateful that they're loved and appreciated. My mind is gone, any chances I had are gone at this point, socially I will never be successful and so what's the point? Youre depressed yeah just tell your friends and family they love you and want you happy! My family wont help me I dont have the means to help myself. My brain is fucking mush. What a world huh

I dont know if I mean most of this but Im not feeling good so dont take it too seriously",1
"The worst thing with depression for me is that I am at the stage where I am constantly expecting bad things to happen. I am always on edge, always wondering when the next bad thing is gonna happen. I get nervous when the phone vibrates, when I see new emails or when I get letters out of the mailbox. I even get small moments of relief after Ive checked my email and see that there is nothing bad there. Anyone else relate to this?",5

"I'm not sure if this is just because I'm growing up and becoming an adult, but I don't seem to have much emotion at all anymore. I just don't really care about anything, I'm never really sad and I'm never really happy. I'm just.. neutral.. all the time. Whereas in the past I remember having fun and happy times, I feel like happiness is a feeling that I *used* to experience, but I don't really get anymore.

I'm just existing because that's what everyone else is doing, going about my day doing whatever, sorta like a robot with no purpose. I constantly ponder how meaningless everything is. I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago and honestly, it barely affected me. My emotions just seem completely dulled down.

Is that depression? Or something else?",5
"Cant even do a basic pizza job right... I work at a pizza place and I am probably my bosses worst employee ever. When I take the phone I mess up the order probably 50% of the time. After fucking things up all day my boss tells me to just go home and he will take the wasted food out of my check. I should do him a favor and quit cause its inevitable that ill get fired. Ive been working at this place for a week. I suck ass at this fucking job, the only thing I do right is wash dishes and deliver orders, everything else I always fuck it up somehow. I am calling tomorrow and saying I fuckin quit. FUCK my stupid brain I hope I get creamed by a semi on the way home.

"Ok so I'm not gonna lie, I'm drunk, its New Year's day, and I have had a lot of time to self reflect lately. I've been off work from a bulging disc injury (I'm an STNA)and one of the biggest things that helps me fight my depression is working.
I've had waaaayyy too much time to just think and dwell on things that don't necessarily have to be resolved but closure would be nice. 
One of which is, I'm the baby of the family...and I fear that I was babied so much that I was never actually punished or told what was right and what was wrong. I feel like my parents just didn't care anymore at that point because my first 3 sisters were exhausting. They just appeased me. Or tried too. 
The second is...was/is my perception of reality messed up, in more ways than I care to type out right now...or is am I just a brat that never learned her lessons...how the hell do I deal with it either way?

TLDR:I feel like since I'm the baby of the family I was babied and wasn't taught the basics and principals of life. Now I'm just treading water till I feel like giving up.",4

"I have good faith now that I am going in an upwards direction with my life and my ambitions, but financially I'm kinda fucked at the moment. Financial shit is what got me out of the cheapest university that I could go into, and it's what's keeping me from even going to community at the moment. I feel like I was doing everything right, and that I've been wronged, but I don't feel like a snowflake. I feel the exact opposite. I am  going in tomorrow to work at mcdonalds while I try to get a job over at the niche mom and pop restaurant near my house. I have job experience and I'm not unemployed, thank god for that, but I'm just feeling depressed and reminiscing about my past and what I could've changed about it, although, there was little room for it. Sometimes it makes me feel liberated feeling like I regret nothing for having dealt with and going to deal with rough shit, but the feeling remains that nobody will ever take me seriously and I fucked up. I just need to vent all of this in a healthy way. If any of you are fans of cowboy bebop, was listening to [this song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WKnVaDwUg5s) earlier while I reminisced.",2
"Hello,

Ive fallen into depression again a few months ago and it got really bad a month and a half-ish ago so i went back to therapy. I went to see the psychiatrist who prescribed me meds. Im on remergon as anti-depressant, akton for anxiety and Zopiclone Teva + ergytonyl for insomnia and nightmares. 

Ive started taking them two weeks ago. Now my question: does any of you have experience with taking those meds while smoking weed? I have not smoked any since i started my meds, but im thinking about maybe having a joint when i get home (im abroad for the holidays). Would that be a bad idea? I know that alcohol can interfere with the effect, dont know what weed will do tho and im way too anxious to just try it. 

Any opinions on the matter are welcome. Thanks! ",3
"I made another post here before but I deleted it out of nervousness. This'll be my second one. Hope it's okay.

I have felt the worst pain ever due to hating my body. It is a great weight that just burdens me every day. I make it part of my life to protect other people from the repulsiveness. I don't wear anything that's supposed to compliment my body, because quite frankly, it just does the opposite. I could go into so much detail about everything. I hate my face and I hate my body. It is this horrible weight, this impending shame. The only thing I can describe it as is...shame. Horrible, horrible shame. 

I don't even hate my body, I hate what I did to it. I hate myself for abusing my body. It works so hard to keep me alive and I've destroyed it. I hate sitting down because then I feel the fat. I hate feeling my stomach touch my shirt because it reminds me that it protrudes even when I suck it in. I hate that my body's imbalanced, because of course, I was blessed with the small boobs that ABSOLUTELY NO ONE in my family has but me. I'm 50 pounds overweight and I have absolutely nothing. My doctor tells me it's okay (despite the BMI saying I'm obese). She tells me that I'm still in a safe range. My heart isn't in danger and nor is my body. That's a relief, but I still don't feel good.

I feel it's my duty to protect the world from my appearance. I don't want to subject anyone to what I have to see. I know people say that other people aren't looking and don't care, but that doesn't matter to me. I would never want myself looking like how I do in public. I don't wear anything that hugs my body. Some take it as ""modest"", and while I do aim to be modest, it's not because of that. I hate moving and getting out of bed and just talking because of it. I just want to hide from the world and stay in a box of shame and guilt. I hate feeling my stomach exist. I hate my stomach protruding. I hate how clothes cut my body fat in half. I call it the 3 phenomenon because it looks like the shape of 3 from a side view. That's the worst feeling to me. That's what always reminds me. I hate going outside and going into public because of it. I hate looking into the mirror. All I see is a ""sack of pig's flesh"", as I've named it. That phrase seems to be the only one that really captures the repulsiveness, disgust, and shame I feel.

I've dreamed of throwing up multiple times. But I know the dangers. I know it destroys your esophagus permanently. But I still want to fix it. I haven't done anything though. I may never do anything about it, regarding dangerous and reckless actions like throwing up. I know it won't ever be truly fixed, because as soon as I get skinny, then I won't have any good attributes. I don't know how I'll ever find a partner without anything appealing or pretty, because I've already cut the pool down to nearly nothing by waiting till marriage and being cyberschooled/being an absolute hermit. Not to mention also being a huge bitch.

I have tried so many times and I give up because I have no self control. I really think I need to be babysat on my diet. I need someone to keep an eye on me till I'm normal, and then get training to help keep a good lifestyle. I have no willpower. All I have is fear and sadness. Even that doesn't motivate me. I have no energy to be motivated. I've disappointed myself so much. I am a disappointment. I am a failure in so many regards and I am so mad at myself for everything. I live in shame. I have to constantly stare at this ugly sack of pig's flesh. It's caused me so much sadness. I don't want to do anything anymore because it just fills me with sadness adn shame. I don't want to stop existing. I just want to hide. Hide so others don't have to see it. No one has told me my body's beautiful. People just say ""you're not fat"" and I know damn right they're lying. They do that after I start whining and crying. Only then will they reassure me, and I know that's to shut me up. No one has ever actually told me I'm appealing. People have only told me my face is beautiful when I have makeup on. Once boys see me without makeup they stop talking to me (But that may also be cause I'm overbearing and kinda weird).

I don't even know if I should post this. I may actually delete this. Sorry if it's too long. Also, sorry if it sounds narcissistic or vain. I'm not looking for compliments. I just needed to say this.",1

I think that people who are depressed can be grouped into two general categories. Those who have been unfortunately mentally wired wrong and those who have experienced some awful trauma or emotional pain. I'm sure for many on this sub it is both. For me it is both. And because of this fact I am uncertain if I can ever recover. I feel as though it is inevitable that I will kill myself. There is a part of me that really doesn't want to; i'm scared. But there are also times that I feel so badly and I just want it to end. Has anyone out there found anything that's helped them? Right now I just don't know what to do.,4

As a little backstory in a junior in high school, it may sound a little silly but i've been in love with this girl (who also is my best friend, been indirectly friendzoned more times than i'd like to admit) since about freshman year. i finally built up the courage to tell her that i have feelings for her.

"In the last month I spent my birthday, Christmas, and new year entirely alone. I likely failed at least one of my exams. Almost every night I've woken up in fear from a nightmare in which my only friend dies.

Two months ago was the last time I went into work and the last time I went to most of my classes. I told everyone I was too busy, but the truth is I was too anxious to leave my apartment. It felt too much like I was just failing.

Three months ago is when I discovered that my depression may be caused by a chronic vitamin deficiency, which I would have been suffering from for over 10 years without knowing. A disorder that could have equally significant impact on my brain and body, which it may have already.

This month I'm going to get checked to see if I'm right. If I am, then my dream career is a bust. If I'm wrong, I'm right back to square one and most likely going to end it. I'm in a lose-lose situation.

The only thing keeping me going anymore is the fact that I don't know how my friend would handle it. She has big dreams that she can absolutely attain, but if she cares about me even a fraction as much as I care about her then coping with my death could ruin everything. Yet at the same  time my presence in her life has been a fairly consistent cause of stress. Another lose-lose.

I don't know what to do. I can't live for myself and I can't live for her. But dying isn't an option either right  now. My life is a giant Chinese finger trap.",2
The title says it all my anxiety stopped me from going down a small waterslide and yet I have the drive and courage to kill myself there must really be something fucking wrong with me,3
"A new way of self harm I've been doing is going onto /r/all , and finding posts or people I disagree with, and just argue with them for the sake of making myself miserable. 

I'm pretty opinionated and compassionate about certain things, and I have pretty unpopular opinions, at least for reddit, and always get into these situations where I get upset, and slowly hate myself even more. 

Anyone else had similar experiences?",5
Now I'm having these dark thoughts for the first time in months and I just want them to go away. ,5
"I love rewatching the original trilogy and the sequel trilogy.  I love the speeches and quotes about hope, rebellion, and doing what right. I really love seeing more diversity in the cast of Star Wars, and love how the focus has shifted from magic space wizards to underdog rebels against evil empires

But it feels like the good guys in our world are losing.

Some of people in power of our government and other spheres of influence (like YouTube and the police system) are abusive and act in their own interests, forsaking the poor, the envoirnent, respect and culture, education.

It takes so much to do good yet it takes very little to do bad.  And there seems to be growing presence of âbadâ online and in real life.

Whatever ârebellionâ exists is just a bunch of people who are hurt, anger, scared, maybe even dying or having everything slowly taken away from them.  A homeless man or disabled person losing programs that can help them. An environment damaged beyond all repair.  A victim being blamed for an abusers action. Parents not accepting their children identity.  A brilliant student being deported to another country and having his dreams crushed for the rest of his life because his parents sent him to a safer country without documentation.  We lost to government that trying to brainwash us with âalternate factsâ and âfake newsâ while also normalizing fascism racism abuse and bigotry. We lost to the FFC.  Hell, I lost my best friend almost a year from today.

I don't talk about it with my friends or family - if you know me, then you would also know my family is dealing with their own toxic politics and  Bullshit...and my friends...are the only good people I have left and I don't want to lose them...  I keep retreating back to Star Wars. I need a han, a luke, a Finn, a Rey, a leia, a resistance or a rebellion....

But it just seems like the people who make up evil empire - the abusers, the gross disrespected, the hate mobs, the uncaring and arrogant politicians- have won on all fronts.

We have no rebellion.  No resistance.  They say not to give into hate - and that love will and has always saved us.  But one day, I may not have anything or anyone left to love and life for , not if I spend the rest of my life in a world run by these kinds of evil people.  ",4
"My first post on reddit - I just joined because I desperately need support from people who understand. I'm struggling with alcoholism, depression, anxiety, and self harm. Most days I wish some horrible accident would happen to me so I could either die or end up in a coma so my thoughts couldn't torture me anymore. I see my counselor regularly, I'm on Zoloft and Wellbutrin, trying to work on daily meditations and CBT. But nothing seems to be working. I haven't felt like myself in such a long time and I'm not even sure of who I was before this. Was I ever happy? Confident? Did I have goals? 

I wish I had something more meaningful to say, but if I keep going it'll just be a novel of negativity. I don't really know what I can find here, but I'm running out of ideas and desperately need to be reassured that I'm not just another face in the crowd. It feels selfish and stupid to admit, but I need someone to tell me that my existence is significant. 

God, it's embarrassing to feel so powerless and incompetent. ",3
All these bull shit new year post makes me sick. My only reaction is perhaps this will be my last year. ,3
"So I started therapy a couple weeks ago, and I just dont feel like it works at all. My mother drives me 30-45 minutes away, for me to sit in a couch in front of a professional,    while I only say one-word sentences. My therapist suggested journaling. She said she would read them if I let her, so maybe I say it on paper and give it to her tomorrow, and hopefully I can get this mess sorted out.",4
"I had to go to a specialist doctor due to heavy inflammation and pain chronically, he asked for blood work and I have yet to go (appointment was in October). I'm not sure if I'm avoiding this because

-or because I'm dying and wouldn't be as upset then the first option.... yikes. ",2
"Idk sometimes I feel like I'm sorting my issues out and getting better, I feel like I am in a better state of mind but then my SO tells me I'm not changing, I'm never going to change. I start to feel lost. I start to feel like I don't belong here",4
"I admire her so much. She makes my life worth living another day. My depression is so gut-wrenching and I often find myself struggling for a will to live, but her smile is so infectious and she makes me smile in even the darkest moments. 

But I need to emotionally detach myself from her. She doesn't even know I exist. She lives thousands of miles away, is super succesful, and has a loved one of her own. 

Does anyone else emotionally attach themselves to people (like entertainers, celebrities, idols, etc.) almost as a form of escapism, but know that you'll never meet them and it hurts? 
I personally am a huge fan of one specific band/group member, and she makes me really happy, I'm just trying to emotionally detach myself from her because I'm afraid her group is going to disband in the near future and she's going to be out of the public eye. ",5
"I was in a relationship with this girl my sophomore year of highschool (graduated June of 17) and I fell in love with her deeply nothing like I experienced before she was like perfect to me then she left me and we had a on/off again thing going on in the summer going to my junior year then when school started again she started being mean and hurtful towards me and she'd always break my heart over and over and i didn't know why I'd go back every time just for it to happen to me again, I ended up falling into a year long depression my whole junior year of highschool, I started heavy drinking when I was 16, I gained weight stopped going out I'd cry a lot have lots of breakdowns threw out the day and lots of times I had to leave a place to have my breakdowns without people knowing it was hard then my senior year came around and I was just like heartless I was savage I didn't have feelings like I used to the word âloveâ don't mean anything to me anymore just a old feeling I once felt that I'm starting to forget what it's like. I ended up cleaning up and stuff getting back on track just besides feeling a dull feeling inside all the time and especially when it comes to relationships with girls but every now and then I get flashbacks of her like things she did to me that really shattered my heart and sometimes good things but like I'm confused on what to do I haven't talked to anyone about it late nights is when they happen the most and I started to get sad again it's confusing I need help on what to do they seem to be occurring more and more often I'm all alone on this please all help is welcome.",4
"I've always felt like emotions are hard for me, I always smile but thats just to make other people feel at ease around me. 


when something bad happens I rarely cry, I do feel aching in my heart and know that its sad I just don't feel like crying is the right way to react.

Is this something you have felt? How do you get along with it?

"Got into an argument with my partner a couple days ago and haven't stopped thinking about it. I have severe depression, not medicated because i don't have insurance, but I see a volunteer therapist every couple weeks. I live with my partner, we've been together for a little over a year. Partner is getting depressed because they feel like all they do is make me feel better. I feel so selfish because I can't help them help me. I feel worthless and like a burden and I just wish I could find the motivation to get out of bed in the morning without bothering them. How do I help myself, so my partner won't resent me in a few years? I'm so afraid of losing them because of my mental illness ",4
"I've talked with her for over a year. I developed feelings for her I haven't developed for anyone else ever. but recently she said she moved on, which I assumed was just her going through an episode that her many mental illnesses can bring out. But today I found out she's dating someone who makes YouTube commentary videos. The worst part about it is their relationship is long distance. She told me the only reason her and I never dated officially and stayed together was because she couldn't handle long distance relationships. but yet this dickhead is farther away than I was. I was always there and I poured my heart and soul into her so she'd be happy. I just don't understand why I'm not good enough. Where I went wrong 


I'm fine with dying tonight. I prayed to god or jesus or whoever to kill me in my sleep tonight. I begged for it. If we had hard alcohol or crazy pills at the house I'd down those. I've accepted that death is a peaceful out for life, so it's what i wanna do to be happy. I just wanna forget about her. Forget about the memories. Forget about all the plans we made to hang out and do so much shit this next summer when I flew over there to see her. It really sucks. I hate myself. I hate the YouTube commentator. I hate her. I hate that I'm still living, shaking and crying over this revelation ",4

"I'll try keep it brief. My younger sister and I have a good relationship, but she's never really talked to me about depression and her apparent anxiety. I recently got to know she's weekly been visiting the nurse practitioner at her school, and she called our family the other day. My sister apparently has struggled a long time with anxiety, and there's some talk about suicidal thoughts as well. I got to know this through my mom just now.

I've read through the talking tips under this sub, but I'm unsure how to deal with this. I have been good at lone-wolfing myself, and never really been depressed, but I'm a good listener. I don't want to start talking to her directly about the issues either, but I'm certain she haven't tried hiding going to the nurse either (she writes appointments on her calendar in her room)

"It's difficult to describe how I feel really because I have no reason to be depressed at all but I am! When I wake up in the morning I'm so disappointed that morning has arrived and i have to live through another day, I try to go back to sleep so I don't have to face the feelings I have! I don't want to burden everyone with my depression and be the one that people avoid because I'm always miserable and low. I'm anxious all the time and don't know how to control this, anxious about the smallest things that other people do each day with ease. Taking a train or a plane can trigger anxiety days and days before and make me feel so low. These feelings I cannot control and really wish I could. I came off my anti-depressants last year and now I'm thinking of going back on them but really don't want to. All the time I feel I'm going round and round in circles with such a heavy load!! Does anyone have any ways of dealing with such feelings? ",5

"So I don't know for sure that I am depressed, but it really does feel like it. I don't feel loved or cared about. Like I'm not special, I'm nobody's favorite person. 

But I know this isn't true. My family loves me very much. My mom, dad, sister, they all care for me so much, and I can tell. I don't necessarily have feelings that strong for them, but I've never felt very strongly about anyone. 

Does that make me wrong? To feel so unloved even though they do? Even if they are the only ones, why do I feel so bad? What's wrong?",1
"For the past few years I've been feeling more and more miserable and depressed and I don't know why.

Things that used to make me happy now just leave me feeling empty. I think my last truly happy day was my wedding day 1.5 years ago, which isn't great for a 28 year old guy I guess.

I think the speed at which things feel like they are getting worse seems to increase which each ""episode"", if you can call it that, where I normally have some kind of break down.

I feel like I'm trapped inside my own head, even though I know I should do something, or sometimes even want to do something I just can't. I'm telling myself to get up of the couch and do those things, but my body just doesn't seem to respond. Instead I just sit there and accomplish nothing.

I used to be so much more positive, I completely changed my career in retail to be a web developer and worked my way up to be in charge of my own team. I always fought my way through the pressure and got really far in my career at a young age and then at some point this all started.

Food is a side affect as well as a cause of a lot of my problems. As I'm so unable to get the motivation to do anything, I normally just order takeout rather than cooking food. Which in turn just makes me feel more guilty and the cycle continues.

It's strange, I image if you asked anybody that I work with or any of the few friends that I have they probably all think I'm a happy, outgoing person. The only person who knows is my wife and even then I'm not sure she knows the extent of how I feel. I also don't want to put extra pressure on her as she has dealt with depression before as well. She eventually went to her GP and they gave her some medication that has definitely made a difference to her outlook on life.

This was a while ago but it made me think that maybe I could get up the willpower to go to the doctors and see if they could help me. This morning I made an appointment with the doctor and I thought things might be looking up, but it didn't take long for things to come crashing down to an all time low.

When I got there they said they had been trying to call me all morning because they had to cancel my appointment since the doctor hadn't turned up. Annoying as it may be this should a reasonable excuse. Instead, I could feel myself stood at reception falling apart inside.

Every now and then I've had thoughts like ""Would things be better if I weren't here"" and afterwards I always said to myself that even though I'd thought it I'd never do something like that.

As I was walking home from the doctors, probably about 20 feet from my street where I had to cross over, it hit me. I was considering just walking straight into the road and I didn't even care. I was actually disappointed when I got to the edge of the path and there weren't any cars coming.

I got in the house and had a massive panic attack, I couldn't breath, then I was probably the most angry I've ever been and throwing things about and screaming at things. I didn't know if I was more annoying at myself for wanting to do it, or for not actually doing it.

I've calmed down a bit now and I've apparently got an emergency appointment with a different GP but all of this only happened about an hour ago and I just don't know how to feel or what to do anymore.

Thanks for listening,
Scott",1
 It sure if I'm dumb or the depression and anxiety is making me feel dumb. I feel like my thinking is limited. ,1
"Toughts

My mind is drifiting away in a shore of thoughts,
Everything sprayed on a piece of paper in form of a thousand dots,

What should I do with my life?
Get rich, some childrens and a beautiful wife?

But the question is how did I deserve that?
Living in the sewers like an ugly rat,

Waiting for a predator to end me,
'Cause even on the brightest days darkness is all I see,

This darkness feels like a home somehow,
I try to get to it but not now,

Sometimes I am standing on the edge,
Looking back to my life as if it was a sketch,

Maybe I should just erase it,
Throw it in a glowing firepit,

I know I will end forgotten,
Noboy standing next to my coffin,

Buried alongside other forgotten names,
As forgotten as mine,

"Hi all fellow friends who are suffering from depression!
I have IBS, suffer from sleep paralysis almost every single night, be a paranoiac. To add to that, I had bone fractures which forced me to go through 2 painful surgeries over the span of 3 years (the first one to add a fixation device to my bone and the second one to remove it). The amount of antibiotics and painkillers I used only makes all the symptoms I have much worse. Sometimes I feel like I am the most unfortunate person in this world. And as a result, the fact that I have all these symptoms in my 20s when all my friends around me are super healthy makes me suffer from depression as well. Things have been hard for me for a few years. I don't want to go out and meet strangers and spend most of my time in my room.

However, a new year has come and I am determined to regain control over my life. I don't want to give in to these diseases that easily. I am too young and I have to support my family as well. I have maintained a habit doing exercises everyday for 2 weeks (running and hitting the gym). Now I want to start reading to understand more about all the aspects of mental health. I would be much grateful if you guys can recommend any books you think would be of great help to a person fighting mental illness. Tks for reading and sharing!",3

And today while I was on my way to my house I by mistake went to my neighbors house and rang their doorbell thinking it was my house.

"I am a 21 y/old male currently in my final year of university in the uk however I still live at home. I have been suffering with anxiety and depression since the age of 14/15 due to my upbringing and circumstances.

I was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness which meant at school I always felt different to everyone else and as such have kept my personal life extremely private. Even though I decided to leave the religion at the age of 16, a large number of my family remain in this religion. I've always therefore struggled to live a 'normal' life, and my small circle of friends still have no idea of my past.

Due to this, relationships with girls especially and making new friends is something I always avoid due to fear of them and everyone else finding out about me. Because of this, I've never had a girlfriend. When I keep to myself and get my head down and focus on university work I can usually put the anxiety to one side, however recently I met a girl who I like and she likes me and it's causing me great anxiety and depression again. She's always telling me about how close she is with her family and not only can I not relate, it annoys me I can't be the same.

I think it has a lot to do with me caring about what people think of me too much as I'm aware of people who left the religion in similar circumstance and have normal relationships and seem to not care.

I like this girl yet she's so opposite to me as she's really outgoing and how normal she is makes me scared she'll only think I'm weird when she gets to know me.

Any words of advice or help would be extremely appreciated. Thanks all",4
"PSA: when someone takes their life, the wrong thing to do is reach out to their closest friends asking for explanations surrounding their depression and general mental state. You certainly DO NOT state that you wish the deceased had reached out to their friends. NEWSFLASH: THEY WISH THAT TOO! This is not a time to point fingers, dig for answers, or to share just how much this has hurt you (I'm talking to you -- the people who have met my friend once or twice) -- especially over social media. Depression isn't simple. It is not brought on by having a few bad days at work. It is not remedied by a change of scenery, a phone call, or a quick trip to the doctors. The people who were closest to the deceased are not here to console you. Life is not about you. It is about the people who surround you. It is a time to celebrate the persons life who has passed, reflect inward, and reach out to those who are in your life and ask for what they might need. ",4
"Cannot believe I am here. I am entirely unprepared for the future I never wanted. I am not suited to bear the burden of existence, the ebb and flow of life which inevitably contains suffering. Life is a beautiful golden package containing pure cyanide . Life is an atomic bomb decorated with glitter. To whom can I return this ""gift""? Where will I find my home? It's unreachable. Not even the hands which were once warm and comforting can accommodate me now. In death I find comfort, an unparalleled feeling of Liberation. Like Hal [Infinite Jest] I find myself at a crossroads between the desire to pursue a better life and the desire to succumb to my addiction entirely. Really, my desire is to escape. I am seeking an El Dorado which doesn't exist. All I want is the life of a hedonist without the repercussions, the drugs and sex minus the consequences. But in reality drugs are a destructive force (not to mention illegal) and nobody I would have sex with wants anything to do with me (understandable). I feel like a prisoner to life, trapped here against my will without the means to escape. I don't want a job, I want to be able to live without needing to sustain myself. I wish I were attractive enough to convince a child free lesbian millionaire to marry me. That way I could live a life of luxury, opulence and self indulgence, and while it certainly wouldn't be fulfilling, it would be better than this.  My soul is tainting the Earth and the Earth is tainting my soul. It's a reciprocal cycle of madness. I am unsuited to life and there is really only this issue at the bottom of everything. It is the mother. Mother. That horrible word, that vile, putrid thing. I do not hate my own mother. I simply resent her decision to give birth to me and the laws which enabled it to occur.  I wish euthanasia was legal for depressed individuals. Wretched sons of bitches, forcing me to live a life I resent.. and for what? So I can be another miserable wage slave. ",2
"I've always loved helping others, whether it means I'm there to talk to them and listen to their concerns, or doing something for them. It makes me feel like I'm contributing something to society, and it is especially rewarding to see when I've helped make their day better somehow. However, lately I've been feeling this is my only good quality, being a utility to others. People only keep me around and talk to me because they know I would always agree to helping them out. They tolerate all my other horrible qualities because the help is worth more to them. Recently, I sent an email to my boss (who I'm pretty close with) with an organized spreadsheet for a work task (something I had not been asked to do, and was my boss's job), and they replied telling me ""You're amazing! Thanks for making everything so organized for me. You are such a gem"". Comments that like sting for me rather than lift me up because they just further validate my belief that I am only a utility to others, and that if I weren't useful, they would ice me out in a second. I still try to do helpful things for others, but lately it's made me feel more horrible than good.",5

-I'm 28 and have abandonment issues.  I so badly want a relationship but I am starting to wonder if I'm capable of having a healthy one.

-I have this sneaking suspicion that at some point I won't be able to keep going.  I've been so close to quitting several times and have barely pulled myself up but then it's all happened again.

"I'm in a dark, deep pit in the ground. It's deep enough so I can just barely here the outside world up above me, but not much. There's a ladder too. Sometimes, I climb up the ladder to peek out of the pit and see what's going on outside. But usually when I do, it starts pouring rain, or a storm starts heading for me. I feel it in my stomach. A lurching, swaying pendulum that swings back and forth. It swings, and I fall down the ladder. I remember that I haven't earned the outside world. I remember that the people out there hate me and rightly should. I remember how selfish it was of me to climb the ladder in the first place as if the world out there wanted anything to do with me.

sometimes it swings a different way, and I feel angry. Angry at myself for not just leaving the pit altogether and facing the world bravely. Angry at the people who hurts me. The pendulum has so much momentum, it slams into my stomach, sending me tumbling off the ladder again, and I hit the freezing cold dirt at the bottom. But I should've known better, no one up there cares about me unless they're somehow benefiting from my being around. When I run out of shoulders to be cried on, spare bedrooms for people to stay in, home-cooked food or money, I'm dispensable. No, less than dispensable- a nuisance. A fly in someone's car, or gum on someone's shoe. I want to scream but the outside world can't hear me, just as I can barely hear them.

Sometimes, people come by the pit and drop in food as if I were a zoo animal. But I like the food. It helps, and when my stomach is full the pendulum has no room to swing. I feel brave again, climb the ladder up out of the pit, and sometimes I even camp outside the pit with a fire and tent, and sometimes people have fun being with me, I think.

The food comes in little orange bottles with strange names but it still helps. It makes it easier to breathe if I do fall into the pit again.
I hope one day, I can leave the pit and go back home.",5

Needlessly to say this relationship didn't last long and damaged me more so I found myself sitting in the floor with a knife thinking if I'm alone and I can't connect to people and I can't process this pain how can I stay here, how do I keep living. Something snapped and I decided I wouldn't kill myself, that I had to live my life regardless because I risked endding my life before happyness came, before seeing what life could bring, i also told myself i was stronger then this so i made the mistake of burying everything and deciding I wouldn't take shot anymore. This worked out for awhile, I found new confidence in myself, I stood up to anyone or anything I needed to, for awhile I felt invincible untouchable. It wasn't until these last few years that everything I buried came back up. It broke me, it zapped me of all my confidence and strength. I never learned to express my feelings and I always had a sense that my problems if expressed to other people were a burden so in turn I died emotionally, I became a poison to my life and the people around me, I damaged good relationships in my life. Being emotionally dead wasn't a fix either so eventually my mind started to wake parts of me up and it made me flip out, it was like waking up from a nightmare where I saw all the damage I did but unlike a nightmare this was reality. I broke down because I saw myself losing everything that held meaning to me in life and in a fit of pain I hurt myself trying to hide from it all and further damaged my relationship. 

Right now I feel like I'm in between my life working out or coming crashing down. I've been dealing with my past issues and I do feel like I'm better mentally then I've been but my emotions still get the best of me. I'm forced on 1 person I want to spend my life with, trying to repair damages, trying to find a way to explain how and what I've felt. I have other points in my life that need attention, ones that if I deal with will bring me closer to this person but I can't not fouces on them, I just want them to see me, understand what I felt, understand it was hard on my too.

Idk where I was going here. I just kinda needed to talk. I guess my point as to what I asked in the beginning is I'm still here living and I don't plan on stopping because I feel like I can achieve what I want but not if I take my life. Life is going to be hard, harder for some them other's but I'm still going to try for happiness and I'm still going to try to make life happy for the one I love whom I hurt emotionally without meaning to.",4
"I didn't sleep very well last night and I returned to work after several days off and it has thoroughly and completely exhausted me. I did want to share something that I read last night that I have thought about ever since I read it. I started his book The Noonday Demon last night in order to properly understand my own struggles with depression. His article Anatomy of Melancholy (http://andrewsolomon.com/articles/anatomy-of-melancholy/)  he wrote in 1999 for The New Yorker in which he talks about his own personal battles with depression have made him a huge advocate for depression and is very informative. Andrew also has done a couple of TED talks. My personal favorite of his can be found here (https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_solomon_depression_the_secret_we_share).

"I like to leave comment replies in this comments in this Subreddit but I don't Submit Text Posts here much. I thought I should write about how I'm doing since I feel like a great success story. Since it's the beginning of 2018, I'll reflect on 2017 as compared to 2016.

I've been seeing a therapist which has been helpful. I've been more thorough about my negative symptoms to my psychiatrist which has allowed me to feel really great about the medicines I'm prescribed.

2017 was better than 2016 for me in every way. I found a new job. I made a ton of new friends. I've taken tons more photos. I've threw several more parties this year with many more guests attending. I traveled three times in 2017, which is a lot for me. I attended way more fun events in 2017 than in 2016. I volunteered more. I ate better. I went to bed much earlier and woke up much earlier. I got many more chores done. I did a lot more reading. I've taken better care of my friends and family. I'm eating much healthier. My body looks way better. I've been going on more dates and more ""successful"" dates. I'm wasting way less money. I clean the place where I'm living way more.

I played computer games and watched TV and read the news (including Reddit) way less. Anything that doesn't feel like it's helping me take good care of myself is a distraction, and distractions were like poison to my depressed self.

I went from wanting to die to thinking life is pointless to loving life and wanting to take great care of myself every minute of it. I'm spending way more time doing things instead of thinking to myself about things.

Hope this helps! Good luck. Rooting for everyone on here.",2
....and now that escape from reality makes me feel a little closer to normal i spent the first 32 years of my life never experiencing depression but now i wonder if i did and i just wasnt bad enough that videogames wouldn't alleviate it completely. I don't understand myself anymore.,5

"I don't want to write a long story to don't make it boring for you.
Let's just say that I don't think that i'm worth living here. Im tired of my own life. First I'm so ugly and don't tell me that everyone is beautiful because i literally am ugly. A lot of people told me that straight to myself. I care about my health but i can't do anything with my ugly face. Second i'm not good at anything and in school i'm the one to joke about. My friend left me week ago because i was boring for her. Its really hard for me because she was the only one who  cared about me. I have a lot of passions and sens of humor but who actually cares?
I have also difficult family. They arent loving and supporting me, because i don't want to do in my life what they wanted me to and im so hopeless. I want to kill my self couse no one needs me and i'm hurting here. I'm thinking about it for so long. I wanted to write it, maybe someone will notice me. I feel so lonely and hopeless. I know that you'll probably think that i'm complaining and i'm selfish and that i'm a kid that doesn't know anything about life.   (couse i'm 16) .

"I'm sure this has been answered a million times, but I can't find an answer that fits my specific situation, so wanted to ask myself.  I don't know if I should post this in /suicidewatch because I'm sitting at work thinking about this and won't go home tonight or in the future to try and commit suicide, but I will move it there if people think it's more appropriate there.

I think about suicide a lot. At least once a day but probably more, and it isn't a fleeting though; I dwell on it.  Recently my favorite band lost its lead singer to suicide and when I found out the method, the first thing that came into my head was ""yeah, this is how I'd do it too.""  Yesterday I was driving down the road and couldn't really shake the idea of ""yeah, I could totally just slam my car into this highway median going 90mph,"" and almost felt a physical tension as my conscious mind restrained my arm from turning the wheel.

That being said, I'm not actively suicidal in that I don't want to die, and while I was diagnosed with depression ten years ago when I was a Peace Corps volunteer, it was largely considered a malpractice diagnosis and was situational at best.  

I don't mind being alive, and I have fun with the people I love, do the things I'm interested in doing, have an amazing family who loves me, etc.  A lot of the time I feel happy.  I just get really tired sometimes (a lot), everything seems like a hassle to a degree, and in areas of my life professionally especially, I feel like I'm always coasting on mediocre and feel like I'll always be mediocre / kind of lost in what I'm doing (and if someone feels otherwise and that I'm doing really well, it's because somehow I pulled the wool over their eyes).  I can't concentrate on ANYTHING.  It takes a lot to get me out of the house to do social things, but once I do, I enjoy myself, and I travel a lot.  Life simultaneously seems like it's flying by and like it's creeping along.  

Is this normal?  Is this something I should be worried about? I'm having a hard time even verbalizing this in a way that I feel like makes sense. ",4
"It's amazing people find ways to kick others when they're down. And normies have stupid advice like ""just kick them out of your life"" yeah I'll take homelessness over abuse right? 

Unemployed, no drive, constantly compared to ""successful"" people and you wonder why I have sucidial thoughts. Maybe it's the depression but I really don't want to work anyway. Everything about it is awful but it sucks having no money. All these companies want is a little bitch and it's hard for me to take it like normies.

But anyway I don't even like me so why I should expect others to like me? Should have killed myself when I had the chance.",2
"Hi. I haven't really posted on reddit before, but I really don't know any other place I can anonymously say this. 

I've had depression before, I've beat it. For a short period of about six months, I felt amazing. I didn't care about people who didn't matter, I didn't feel dark and empty inside, it didn't hurt to be alive. But something happened in the summer that has made me feel that way again. My suicidal thoughts have returned, and worse than ever. It was a time when I was the closest to actually killing myself.
I thought it was situational, that it would go away, but it didn't. It just came back and it stayed, and it manifested in a form much stronger than it was in before. 
What's worse, is that I really feel helpless now. I can't tell my family about this, they will only tell me bullshit like ""the power of you will can change this"" or whatever. I don't feel comfortable talking about this to my friends, hence me talking about it here anonymously, and my boyfriend tries to help me but I feel like nothing he is doing is helping, and it's not his fault, it's mine. And I'm afraid that if my brain stays in this stupid place, he will leave me, and my friends would leave me, as people have left me due to that before. I'm afraid I'll be alone again, more alone than I already am. And a lot of the times I feel like none of this is worth it. That I should just go ahead and end this life of pain already. 
I don't know where I was going with this or why I'm posting this... maybe it's just an act of desperation. Nothing in my head makes sense now.

"This is my first post here, so please be kind.

I am facing the following situation: 10 exams in January (Masters degree level), and a very bleak and uncertain future after that. (No, you don't get a job or internship or whatever even w/ a Masters degree, when you are as much of a loser as I am). Here's the thing though: I have been struggling with depression for a long, long time. It comes and goes in episodes. I noticed that taking the contraceptive pill Yasmin exacerbates my depression. I started taking the pill a year ago, went off it for a couple of months in the autumn, and now I had to start taking it again because my nightmarish hormonal acne started coming back.  My cheeks look like the surface of the moon ffs (just for the record, I'm 25, never had acne as a teenager; it hit me at the age of 22. Now I have both pimples AND wrinkles. yey.) I have tried everything else but Yasmin was the only thing that got me rid of the cysts. I won't stop again. As you can imagine, having a bad, cystical acne AGAIN would make me twice as depressed. With regards to the antidepressants,  I did take Cipralex last autumn but it didn't help really; if anything, it made me feel even more suicidal.

So, future is grim, but I have to push through, sadly. I am giving life one final chance - 2018 will be do or die (literally) -  cos I've taken far too many Ls so far and I am just sick and tired. If I don't get my shit together by December 31st, it's game over. 

Do you have any advice on how to proceed and make it through January? I am looking for some pill or whatever to sort of numb any emotional thoughts/feelings I have and to reduce the frequency of my nervous meltdowns and crying, while at the same time doesn't sap me completely. I need some energy to learn that stupid shit that is required for the exams.

Thank you.",2
"Ultimately, I've started to notice that most people around me (friends, family, etc) whom I highly regard as a big part in my life are seeing myself as a lifeboat or a complementary support that can attend to me, throw all their dirty laundry and shit all over myself (in a physcological aspect of course) and leave like nothing happened and expect me to not care, deal with their problems and understand them in a friendly way (which I have done lately, since I'm unable to find another course of action because showing displease will seem rude) until brief moments pass, these people have new problems and come to me again to throw everything again expecting me to be as friendly as ever. As if being pushed around all over the place and treated as a 3rd dish is what I deserve that is according to their point of view. Though I'm exhausted of being treated this way, maybe it's because I'm such a good person all the time. It seems that I have a tag in my back reading ""Do what you want with me, I will always be there to recieve your shit with open arms, no side effects"". I'm fucking tired of being treated as a mattress where they can lay in when the world fails them.
It seems that my being doesn't inspire to be treated seriously and I'm not worth a thing. Maybe I need to be less of a good person, I really don't know, but I'm starting to think that I should scream all the swear words that I can imagine even if this makes me look as the enemy.",4
"I was really happy until midnight and wanted my friends to be happy too. But after that it went straight down to doom. 
Not only did I hurt a woman I know, who works at the bar, but also cried infront of everyone. 

Worse thing, it wasn't like normal crying, it was my uncontrolable Depression-Crying. And I never did this infront of my friends. I guess I also kinda drank too much alcohol (which is why I told myself to quit it this year - wish me luck).

I'm not a person to talk about my feelings, since it mostly worsen my depression. Like it does now. I feel so bad, but I pretend like I don't remember infront of the others.

My friends think it was the alcohol, I guess. But it was just a side-effect, comparing to the true reason, which is, that 2017 was one of my worse years by now. I always thought, it will get better, I can stand this and become better at controlling it. But I haven't calculated failure and so I'm thrown back years.

I just dig myself deeper in this pit of depression and realization that, things may get better for me but I dont know about the rest of the world. Do I try to help? Do I just let it happen like everyone around me does?

"     You know when that feeling of disappointment when you discover that santa wasn't real and it was just your parents all along? I can't help but feel like that has been my whole life up until now.

     My life seemed just perfect until middle school. I was an optimistic social butterfly with a family that had a decent paycheck. At that time, it seemed like everything was placed perfectly and my life was the envy of others.

      When I made it to middle school, everyone would point out how ""black"" i was (My family is all white, and i happen to be slightly darker than all of them with some really coarse hair). I would tell my mother about how upset it made me, and she would reassure me that I had nothing to worry about. She said that I was slightly darker because she drank lot's of pepsi when she was pregnant (this doesn't sound rediculous when you're 13). By this point everyone at my school thinks I've gone mad or that I'm truly in denial about my skin. I wasn't, I was telling them genuinely what I thought was true. 

     When i turned 14, my parents got into a pretty hairy argument that was pretty normal at the time. My mom would be upset that my dad caught one of her lies, and she would make herself seem like the victim. My dad was pissed that she could easily make everyone feel so sorry for her (even if she was in the wrong), and he looked me straight in the eye and told me ""I'm not your real father"". I never cry... ever. But when the man tgat raised you you're entire life can just flick you off his shoulder like that. That... shit... destroyed... me.

     Turns out, my mother cheated on father she was dating my father for 5 years, and she accidentally conceived me. She tried to keep it a secret from the family and even my father.... and idk how, but she managed to keep everyone fooled. According to my cousins, aunts, and uncles, everyone already knew. She told the ENTIRE family to keep the truth from me.

    While i was in school, I couldn't look anyone in the eye. Not because i was mixed, but because I spent 2 years trying to convince everyone i was white. After this whole situation, there were two different kinds of people at my school. People that could capitalize on my misery, and the people that would sympathize me. Both of these kind of people disgust me.

     I'm 22 now and i moved out of my mothers home and now I really feel hopeless. I don't have a lot of friends, I don't feel as if I can trust anyone really. I hate the feeling of being manipulated, but i also hate the feeling of being alone. I'm beyond confused and idk how to fix myself.

TL:DR - My mother cheated on my father and I'm a result of it. I wasn't told that my father wasn't my biological father until i was 14 and it's a curse that wont go away",1
"No one wants to be around me. I don't think I'm a bad person, I actually think I have a really good heart and just want to be loved. But everyone thinks I'm this horrible piece of shit and I'm totally alone now.


I probably should've started posting here earlier. I've been dealing with chronic depression since forever pretty much. My depression often manifests itself in anger. I got diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder when I was like 18. I'm on meds now and seeing a new therapist (looking forward to our third session). So, I am trying to get better and I am optimistic. But right now I'm going through one of the darkest times ever.

My last friend that I've known for 12 years played me on New Years. He said âdefinitelyâ and â100%â to hanging out with me on New Years, I have the screen shots to prove it.

I'm such a depressing loser piece of shit I only attract the biggest pieces of shit. And I hate myself so I hate anyone that's around me so much. It's horrible.

"For the past like two years now I've been depressed with on and off suicidal thoughts which sucks ass man, but lately around mid 2017 I started to just become numb and not even care about shit. My grades have t always been great, but it's freshman year and i already failed first semester of algebra, almost failing like one or two more classes, and have to retake algebra in the summer. I don't know if I can do it man. Everyone says I'm smart and I'm not actually depressed and don't have ADD when I've talked to them so many times. I do actually have ADD and am pretty damn sure after having heavy depressive symptoms for over two years I'd start to notice I'm actually depressed. No one takes a 15 year old kid seriously. Sure, I ride bmx which is like the only thing I live for (and photography), and I'm a funny guy too. Most people even say I'm pretty attractive, like a 9/10. I've only had one official girlfriend, and two other girls I've had a thing with. I do know that multiple girls like me, and one of my female friends even said she liked me before, and still does, so do I, but I think we both agree on just being friends. I honestly don't think it would be the best thing to do to try and become more than friends. She's probably my best friend, and vice versa, and one of the only people I feel comfortable talking to about my shit, along with one other really good female friend. The thing is though, I haven't been able to talk to them since my parents took my phone a couple weeks back before break, and now during break I haven't been able to have it or talk to anyone, or hang out. I'm not complaining or anything, I think no phone for now is actually good to take it easy on electronics and become more outgoing, trying to become involved in people and nature, or just other things than texting and playing games all day. Although I've been filling my time with anime most of the day, and I have wrestling practice almost every day for two hours which keeps me really toned and healthy which is good. I'm just tired man, I don't even know why I just wish I wasn't existing. Now I'm just rambling shit. If you actually read this, thanks.",2
"I struggled with OCD, depression, and anxiety.

The SSRIs completely took away my depression, but didn't resolve my anxiety or OCD.

I never took high doses of SSRIs yet, but have any of you experienced this.  I found it weird that depression was the easiest to lose.",3
"Ive been going through so much at this point, and I want to let it out all out so please bear with me since I'm just depressed at this point. You might relate to this.


I love too much and it's hurting me because they don't love me or care for me back. It's not romantic wise. It's just one of those genuine friendship types.

They distance themselves away from me because they know that's what's best for our relationship 

It's all my fault I ruined our friendship. I put too much care into them. I bought them a lot of things to show how much I care. But I messed up. I messed up big time. I was living in denial the whole time.

I found out they only still care about me because they're a good person. Not because I'm something. I was such an idiot. I was the asshole beachside I kept expecting something in return from them. 

And I can't stop caring about them. I want to isolate myself from them for good, because they don't deserve someone like me at all. All I did was hurt. 

I easily get jealous when they give care and attention to someone else.

My god, I'm just really sad and heartbroken at this point. Just a depressed teen here, crying hot tears in bed, and listening to chill hop. I am nothing but a horrible piece of shit. 

To make things worse, one of my closest friends in high school are in the hospital, unable to speak at all because they were shot on Christmas. My dad fell super ill as well...


Life really does give you a box of chocolates, doesn't it?",4
"This is my first time posting here. I have been mentally going downhill for a few years now. About 3 years ago my dad got sick with cancer and went through all the treatments, radiation, surgeries, chemotherapy and eventually when all else failed, immunotherapy. He ended up in the ICU on a ventilator for a few weeks until he ultimately passed away. This whole experience broke me. He was my person. My mom and I aren't very close. I have no other close family members. I definitely felt myself slipping once he got sick and then watching him get worse and worse. He died in April and I've been functioning but I feel fucking terrible most days. I wake up feeling so shitty, like complete despair. I feel like this planet and most of the people on it suck to be frank. I never had a clear cut direction or passions to follow so I find myself thinking about my purpose a lot. I do wish I could end my life some days but I know I never will. 

I go to therapy. I have tried some medications but honestly I haven't found anything that works. I don't enjoy anything really so I don't have hobbies. I do have a fiance. He is a saint. He's my only real support. He's been getting me through.
I just need to know of anyone who has been this bad and came back. What meds have worked for you, what have you done to get yourself out of this?

I had a difficult childhood too and therapy has brought up a ton of emotional baggage that's contributing to my mental state.",3
Last year I had some of the darkest moments in my life. I've been reflecting over those moments the last few weeks and I have finally accepted the fact I need help. I've always thought I could do things on my own and I didn't need anyone's help. However last year showed me I can win battles on my own but I'll never win the war without people supporting me. So I decided to try to let people into my life this year and let them help me when they offer it. Also I just want to try to be more social in general.  To start out I decided to make a Facebook account since people always seem to ask me that and I always say I don't have one. Ironically when I tried signing up it said my name wasn't real. Haha can you believe it oh god truly has a sense of humor. Anyway as soon as I got there I started seeing my friends accounts and their friends and even though I knew some these people for some reason I got the feeling I always get when I'm around a lot of people. The feeling of not belonging. I hate this feeling and it's probably because I spent so much time isolates from other people but I never seem to feel like I fit in even with friends. I look at the whole thing and it's just not for me. It's like these people are happy they have lives they care about others. They put themselves out on the internet for everyone to see where as I'm a more personal type of guy. They are normal human beings and at times I honestly question wether I even am human. Anyway it's weird just wanted to put this out there. ,4
"Back in August I finally got the help I needed, and was prescribed therapy and medication. I'm overall in a much better place than I was beforehand, but I feel myself slipping back. I have dangerous thoughts, I'm crawling back inside my own head, and I left the apartment only once this entire weekend: to do my laundry so no one will notice anything is amiss tomorrow. 

Since I've been on it, I could count the number of days I've missed taking a pill on one hand. Then, over about the last month and a half, I noticed a decline.

I doubt it's a matter of increasing the dosage of my medication either. I'm on Effexor 300mg, have been for a couple months now. My provider told me that I'm already at the upper limit for medicinal dosage, so it seems that simply going up won't be an option. Which kinda sucks, as I'm not dealing with a whole lot of side effects, except for maybe memory problems, which is probably unrelated as it's historically been terrible anyway.

I think it's just simply a matter of it not working as well anymore. At the peak, I could go hours, sometimes a day or two, without a thought about killing myself. Before, I couldn't go an hour without considering it for at least a couple minutes. Now they're back, along with the feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing.

I don't want to go back to that, I don't want to. I want to get better. I just want to know if it's possible for medication to just... stop working like this. To work one week, and then start dropping down again. It sucks. It really fucking sucks and I just want to stop wanting to jam a fucking knife in my neck. 

So, yeah. Is that possible? For medication you've been on for less than 6 months to just stop?",5
"Why does everyone think that it's just a temporary state and I will get over it? It just makes me feel worse, because I know that I will NOT get over it ever. Hah.. I am alone and I'll always be. I don't know why but family doesn't make me feel not alone, even when my family is great and I care about them more than myself. I would kill myself a long ago, but I can't because of fucking not knowing what's after death and my family.",4
"I don't remember exactly when it started, but I do remember all those lonely walks home from school. I remember picking up snow and see it melt in my hand and I would tell myself that it was me. I was about 11 I think. 

It all turned worse once I got in my teens. I sort of just lived thru it and yes I made my parents life a living hell by being angry. Today I believe that was all a cry for help. I did a lot of weird shit, some weird relationships. But I always worked and maintained a job. All the time. I did all my chores and I tried I really did. 

Then you turn 18 and your supposed to start living. I left to work in FL, didn't work and moved back to Europe. A lot back and forth and finally decided to be a nurse because of pressure from my parents. At this point I was angry all the time again, but I worked hard to maintain composure and let it all out while I was alone and yes I was alone a lot of the time. 

I met my husband (just got married on Friday) and I thought life would finally make a turn for the better. We decided to move FL after some months in Europe and I was for once excited about life. FL didn't really work out because school was not what I thought it was. 

So now we live back in Europe under my parents roof until we find an apartment and yesterday it all came crashing down again. 

I have always been thought to speak my mind if something is not right. I'm 22 turning 23 this year and I'm still being treated as a child. My own father stood and watched me cry and told me I never did anything right and that I'm an embarrassment to the family. I have learned to control my temper, but I am a loud and sarcastic person and maybe sometimes that doesn't work. 

It all came crashing down yesterday and I haven't felt this bad in years. I told my father I wanted to see a shrink, but he laughed at me and told me to grow a pair. He told me that nothing I do is ever good enough and that I'm just rude. 

I don't know what more to do. I do everything they tell me. I go to school and I work. I smile and try to be funny. I guess the voice was right. I was never good enough and I never will be. ",4
"Guys I've been so depressed lately, but I have so much shit to do in my life rn. I really really need some suggestions for (healthy) coping mechanisms to just get through the day. 

I already journal daily, I go to 12-step meetings when I can, I listen to loads of music, and I meditate occasionally. Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated â¤ï¸ thank you so much. ",5
I don't know what is happening to my mind. I have got 3 panic attacks in the last 5 days. Everything is getting messed up. Things are going downhill at my home. I can't sleep at night now for the shoutings and all the fights. I can't study even though exams are coming. My soul love just got engaged to someone else and I have to see tgose the moment I step out of my house as he is my neighbour. I always wanted to go abroad and make a living as a nurse. I am falling in my grades and all my former classmates are settling down overseas. My relatives hate me because I am bad at studies and a fat and ugly girl. I can't take this anymore. And also my depression is having a great time feeding over my faliures!!,3
How was your first two days of 2018?,5
"So I heard that I should find a creative outlet to help cope with my depression...
I've been suicidal for 5 years, pretty much as long as I've been depressed.
Im to cowardly to actually do it but I just kind of wanna stop existing, I'm just extremely sad although I don't fully understand why.
So I'm kind of by myself venting because nobody really cares, I spend most of everyday just talking to myself... Mostly self hatred negative thoughts and I guess I'm a small cause of my depression.
So I'm kind of just looking for a creative outlet to let out my sadness and depression, so I have like three ideas for it. One of my major ways of coping with depression is joking about it, it has become a really good coping strategy believe it or not.
I wanted to do a couple things
1 I wanted to start a YouTube channel
2 I wanted to start publishing my art
3 I wanted to start animating

I really enjoy drawing, I love it and it's a form of coping for me.
YouTube is kind of just something for me to not feel alone, I probably won't actually do it though I just think it'd be interesting to get like minded depressed people to kind of hang out idk but there is a lot of us that seem to relate easily.
Animating has always been kind of cool, I love adventure Time and Rick and Morty, although it's kind of expensive at first I think it'd be a fun hobby for me to invest in.

Do you guys have any tips though, im just trying to keep my head up as long as possible without breaking down.

I just want to be happy. thats all,5
"When I'm really struggling internally, I overcompensate externally. Think Ross from Friends when he finds out about Rachel and Joey. That episode struck a chord with me because I've lost count of the times when I've tried to put on a good show and ended up looking like an absolute idiot. I'd get all loud and animated; try to be funny; try to convince others and myself that there's nothing wrong. They say the unhappiest people are the ones that seem the happiest. For a large chunk of my school days, that was me. My face was laughing and smiling but my eyes weren't. In my adult life, pretending got harder until I just couldn't any more.

Why did I feel like I had to put on that front? Originally it was because I just wasn't even acknowledging to myself that I had a problem. These days it's more fear of how people would respond if I displayed my true emotions. Some people don't âbelieveâ in depression. I don't know how, because it's everywhere. The word âdepressedâ is flung around flippantly by people who are just upset about something or having a bad day. Maybe that's where the apathy comes from. People who claim to be depressed trivialise the condition for those whose lives are genuinely blighted by it.

There are unwritten rules for answering certain questions. When people ask: âhow are you?â they expect to get the statutory âI'm fine thanks, how are you?â Not: âI feel like I'm falling apart and I can't cope,â or âI don't know how I'll get through the day,â or some other variation of the hellish truth. That makes for a rubbish situation where, even when you get texts or actual face-to-face enquiries into your wellbeing, you skirt around it or make something up or dismiss it.

âWhat have they got to be depressed about?â

I've dedicated the other half of this post to tackling some of the things I've heard people say relating to depression. This one usually rears its head when there's a celebrity involved. Take Robin Williams for example. Known for his seemingly happy-go-lucky nature and vivacious sense of humour. Clearly his smile was hiding a world of pain. But he's rich, he's famous, he's successful. What's he got to be depressed about? We'll never know the answer to that, but we need to stop asking the question. Or rather, we need to stop asking it in such a dismissive way. When the news broke about Aaron Lennon, it was immediately followed by references to his income and status as a Premier League footballer. Yes, there are people who have it worse economically and people who have had horrible, harrowing things happen to them throughout their lives and just âgot on with itâ but why use that as a stick to beat someone who is already at rock bottom? They will be well aware of all that. Everything you're saying and thinking, they will have said to themselves ten times over. So then there's the feeling of guilt thrown into the mix; the sense that they have no right to feel the way they do. That just compounds the issue.

âDon't be so sensitiveâ

Depression's not about sensitivity. Some of the strongest, toughest, take-no-prisoners- type of people suffer with depression. I know because I know them. There needs to be more openness and understanding surrounding mental health and well-being. But we don't all need to be holding hands and showering each other with compliments and treading on eggshells, scared to say or do anything that may be misconstrued in some way. Far from it. When someone is in the pits of despair, the best thing you can do is just be there for them. In the most normal way possible. You don't have to do anything spectacular or extraordinary. You don't have to change your behaviour or your personality or the way you interact with them. You haven't got a magic wand. You can't fix their problems. But just being there can make all the difference. Sometimes, when wandering the corridors at work, perpetual cloud hanging ominously overhead, the sight of a friendly face coming towards me was enough to make me a bit better. If honest surveys were taken in the workplace, there would probably be a surprising number of people who are experiencing depression or anxiety, or have experienced it at some point in their lives. Everyone's fighting their own battles. It would be so much easier if people could join forces.

âIt's attention seekingâ

This one is dangerous, because if someone at rock bottom hears this about themselves, after they've plucked up the courage to disclose what they're going through, it can send them spiralling into further isolation and their thought patterns spiralling down life-threatening avenues. When I hear the phrase âattention-seekingâ used in relation to depression, it makes me laugh and makes me angry in equal parts. Do people really think I've devised this little world of hell for myself and decided to live in it just for the fun of it? That I choose to be a misery who can't see the point in anything anymore? That I consciously throw away people and things and opportunities that mean a great deal to me because I just love to make life hard for myself? The isolation, the hopelessness, the despair, the panic, the dread, the turmoil, the cacophony of emotions â all of them negative â crushing my spirit day in day out. Love all that, me.

"Hi guys,
Looking for any help I can get!
I've been on Pristiq 100mg for 10 years. (Stupidly got forced into it at 18 when my brain was still maturing). Spent the last two years on 50mg, and the last 6 months cutting it in half, then quarters, then 8ths. (I know you're not meant to cut them, but all docs seemed to have no idea what to do.)

I really haven't felt sad or hopeless since I was about 20ish, so have just been taking them as I could never get help or instructions for tapering off from docs. 

These last 2 weeks, I've stopped taking the 8th of a tablet and oh my God. 
I don't know who I am. The side effects are terrible. I am jumbling my words, mental blanking so hard that some days I can't remember how to get home, or find my car in the car park. Extremely angry and irritable, crying over everything, literally a cute freaking dog on TV. I forget basic words, today I referred to the pantry as the bathroom, just weird shit. My short term memory.. Is non existant. I just had to ask my partner to repeat what I just said to him cause I couldn't remember.  I start making up words and somehow convince myself they're a word!? (Refrigenative???)wtf. Yet I'm a lit nerd. I'm an executive too.. In the advertising industry. Words and well written sentences and quick wit are what my career revolves around. I am fucked. Would love to know if anyone else has been in this situation.. I don't know what to do. :(
 
This whole experience just makes me want to jump in front of a truck. All because I wanted to get off these medal before I have kids.. ",5
"I just felt like I needed to write about how I currently feel and the stage that I am in my life. I'm a college student, I can be social but sometimes I just don't feel like talking to people or just can't find things to talk about. I also recently realized that no one really checks up on me other than my girlfriend or my family. I'm not saying that I don't value them, it's just that I feel like they feel obligated to talk to me since i'm their S.O. or son. I feel so lonely but I just want to be left alone to do my own thing sometimes. I do so much for my friends. I have this one friend, where since high-school I alone brought him a cake to celebrate his birthday and I buy him gifts and help him out whenever he needs anything. But he doesn't do the same. None of my friends really do the same. I always message them and ask how they are doing but they never ask me how I am. They only message me if they need help fixing their car or doing stuff around the house. I don't mind doing it, but it's got to the point where I think my friends only have me around just in case they need assistance. I did a test where I didn't message anyone for about 2 weeks to see who would check up on me. No one did with the exception of my gf. I Don't know. I feel blessed having supportive parents and a loving girlfriend. But I just can't shake the feeling of feeling so alone without them. They are the only people I actually talk to. other than that im just either sitting down thinking or working on my car. If i didn't have my parents or my gf i don't think I'd really have anyone. It's getting really tiring trying too keep myself busy so i wouldn't have to think about this. I guess I'm just afraid of the moment where I don't have anyone for support and am just there. idk... well enough of my rambling. I hope everyone has a wonderful new year and morning",4
"It's been a crappy winter so far. Found out I'm going to be out of a job at the end of the month and I don't know what else I'm going do do with myself.

My car is continuing to fall apart. I had been saving some money in hopes of buying a new one, but I'm not quite going to be there when the revenue stops.

On top of that, I've developed a skin condition right near my eyes, and having it happen over the holidays has made scheduling a specialist very difficult. It's gotten worse since then and I don't think it's going to heal easily.

Apart from all of that, I declined to go to a relatively important holiday party because I feel like crap. I already have a terrible social life, but I'm not making things any better for myself. Worst of all, I fell like I seriously disrespected the people I avoided and missed a once in a lifetime chance to know them better. I suck suck suck.

I knew I was going to feel bad about staying home, but felling how I do lately, I just can't handle myself. Either way, I feel hurt pretty badly, but sitting home licking my wounds is a shame on me and no one else.",4

"I have been depressed for 6 years now. I went to see a therapist and I told my parents and friends about it, around 5 years ago. A year after that, I just accepted my depression and I acted like everything was going great. My parents  and everyone else were relieved and I swore that I would never tell anyone about my burden anymore. But it feels good to admit it here.
I honestly believed that I deserved all those horrible feelings and lack of happiness, but I have a better self-esteem now and I want to feel better. I'm no longer thinking that I deserve this, no one does actually. I'm considering getting help again but I wonder if a therapist can trust me after faking getting better to another therapist? And should I tell the people around me how I faked getting better?",5
"My last job was initially a 12 month contract, that I extended to 16 to cover the department's busiest period. I really liked almost all of my colleagues but hated the work, as well as the studies I had to do alongside (work related qualifications). That, alongside depression that had gone undiagnosed and untreated for, let's say 9 years at the time, led to me letting the contract end and leaving.

My last contracted day was 31 August 2016. I started taking antidepressants in mid December of that year and started online Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in late December just gone (having been on the waiting list since October 17, maybe).

It feels like I've gotten dumber by the day. At my worst I was playing videogames for maybe 16 hours a day, just for the escapism. I listen to a lot of podcasts these days but even then, if the weather is shitty and/or I can't drag myself outside then I'll just throw GTA V on and grind that whilst listening, doing the same boring missions that I stopped enjoying long ago for the in-game money that I don't even need to buy stuff that I don't even want. 

My concentration was always better in work compared to home study, but the brain is a muscle too and I fear I've lost that ability to concentrate in this time out of work. It feels like I've got dumber every single day in the pursuit of that escape. Even when I'm listening to podcasts that are educational, that doesn't matter. It feels like the brain itself has lost its processing power and memory. 

&gt;Edit regarding escapism: I feel the need to distract myself at all times. I've had a rail card application pending for around a week now, I just remembered after posting - sorting it now. How am I supposed to be relied upon to do the simplest of tasks? 

I have stopped socialising, having seen one friend once in I don't know how many months, I even stopped chatting online, having muted the group chat. I just seem to have no interest in what they're talking about and don't have much going on to talk about myself. As a social circle we don't seem to have many common interests besides football, gigs/festivals and getting wasted. 

I had a hot streak in early December with applications and got five job interviews in a week and a half or so, being successful in my third &amp; fourth choice, accepting my third choice. Admittedly it's still pretty good, pays better than the fourth as well, but it is further away. This sounds like a r/humblebrag, but the problem is that I barely did any prep for any. In fact I just relied on prep for the 4th choice, which came up first of the lot, probably ruining my chances in the others. Almost certainly the second anyway, as whilst they were both rather long shots, I thought that interview went surprisingly well - guess I'll never know if more prep could have tilted the balance. The job was far more interesting, the pay difference was pretty significant, plus I'd have gotten free train travel to and from work - I'm still massively bummed out about that.

All this and I haven't even mentioned the fact that I can't get to sleep before 4am. I'm still miraculously in the habit of waking up early, so I tend to get a few hours, wake up at around 8am, be too tired to move, fall back asleep and wake up at somewhere between 11:30 and 1:30, feeling like shit. 

I've looked into going Keto for a while now, but since as long as I can remember I'll take the lazy route if eating crappy junk food over even making a bowl of cereal, so the idea of meal prep is stressing me out no end, not to mention doing the shopping for it. 

I think my second CBT call is tomorrow (online materials with weekly phonecalls), I just thought it would be good for me to get this all down somewhere before his call...",2

"Hey guys, this might be pretty long but I have stuff I need to talk about. Oh, and I'm using a throwaway because a family member knows my main account name.

So, I've had depression for as long as I can remember, Originally, I though I was depressed because I was just lonely, so I spent a couple of years on a few dating sites where no one would talk to me because I'm not good looking enough. That made me feel even more worthless than I already did. Until my current girlfriend came along and started a long distance relationship with me. 

When she came into my life, I was in a particularly dark spot where I was having suicidal thoughts constantly and I even got out of bed at one point to grab my scissors and end it all. I eventually decided not to do it and went back to bed. The day after that last part, my girlfriend started talking to me, that was almost 2 years ago now and since she came into my life, I've gotten better and am much happier, generally, than I used to be.

A couple of months or so ago my suicidal thoughts were coming back and I told her about it (she knows everything above this) and then she started freaking out and getting depressed because she felt like she wasn't helping me at all. I reassured her that she was helping me and she didn't need to freak out or get depressed. A couple of days after that, the suicidal thoughts went away for a while.

Lately however, my depression's just really been getting to me and I'm just tired of living. I don't really want any advice, I just want to vent somewhere where I don't have to tell my girlfriend because I don't want her being depressed because of me again. Anyway, I'm getting off point here. Sorry about that.

Now, I did say I originally thought I was just depressed because I'm lonely. After being with my girlfriend, we eventually came to the conclusion that it's not really because I'm lonely, I honestly just don't have a reason for it. My life isn't bad, I'm in college and have an amazing girlfriend who wants to spend her life with me. I don't know, maybe I'm just broken or something. I think I should just end this here. I'm not actually going to kill myself or anything, but I am just so tired of being alive. I'm sorry if this isn't an appropriate place to post this, but I posted it here because it's something I don't want to tell anyone I know and I don't know where else to talk. I just want to feel like someone out there is listening.",4

I always spend most of my time in my computer doing nothing but being useless all day playing games or browsing reddit to then feel like a piece of shit at night.
Whenever there's the opportunity to socialize or go out of my town I reject it because I feel a bit anxious at first or feel really lazy.
All the goals I set for myself always end broken because of a lack of motivation or straight up laziness.
That's just me, nothing but a waste of space and a burden to everyone around me, that is also the embodiment of laziness",5
"""You're weak""
""You will fail your exams again""
""You work in brainless job"" My first real job experience in amaon and im blamed, it was hard for me to convince myself to work there, thats what you get when your parents are rich and successfull
""Your girlfriend is ambitious and she will leave you again""
""You're wasting your time""
""Building future with your gf is like building sand castle, it will be disappear sooner or later""


I was also blamed hard that in going to my gf home for 2days(she has christmas 6th), i promised her and also planning to go with her to wedding of her cousin, but its not okay for them

Give me gun please, i cant handle, im going right now(last day) to that ""brainless"" job and im on fucking edge.. I will have like 20 whole fucking days to prepare for my two exams and i think that i can do it, but with their ""help"" i want to die",4
"Thankfully I noticed that they were supposed to expire today right before I took them so I grabbed a new bottle. I hope these take effect fast, I keep forgetting to take them and end up in a cycle of self medicating instead.",3
I finished my studies in June 2017. It's when my depression got worst where I am not motivated to do anything at all and just stay at home doing nothing when I'm supposed to be looking for a job/goals in life. Now it's 2018.......................................... it's already been half a year that I did nothing at all. Nothing.,5
"I've always struggled with social anxiety and periods of depression, but this feels way harder to shake. 

Just started taking some meds to help with depression and anxiety. Hope they help.

I know I need to reach out to a therapist, I know I need to be more active and not sleep all day, I know I need to eat better and be better to myself. Finding it hard to get out of this current cycle. Any advice is appreciated. ",5
"I'm not sure where at started but the first time where I actually felt like shit was when I was going through my first school exam. Since it was my exams I just thought it was because of a fear of failing but even after receiving ok results I felt like utter shit in fact I felt like shit for at least 3 months after it. 

It's like everything is dulled out or monotone and I'm not trying to sound edgy or whatnot. All I want to do was go home to play games and watch anime. I enjoy talking to people and acting a clown because I rather not have people be unhappy if I can try fix it. Everything is temporary and anything I try to give myself some sort of joy just fades and I'm just back alone constantly saying fuck in my head.

I don't want to say I'm depressed because it's unfair to think I'm depressed when everyone has it worse and I don't have the right to... ugh idk.
I'm 16 now and I'm waiting for all this shit to end because I'm hoping its nothing but puberty fucking with me but then again I feel like it won't end.

I'm honestly sorry if everything I just said made no sense, I'm just looking for somewhere to let off a bit of steam idk",2
"At this point it is almost certain that i am going to get kicked out of college within a few month's so I'm planning on leaving on my own terms soon. 

I don't know what i am going to do with myself once I've left and i don't know how to tell parents and other relatives.

I don't want to be fucked over for the rest of my life but i can't keep dealing with shit. ",2
"Hello all, 

 My name is Justin. I'm 30 years old, drug free and enjoy the occasional beer. I've recently become homeless do to losing my job. I've been suffering with depression (I've been in therapy for the last few months) for let's say the last five years. Which in return has caused me to lose a lot of relationships and trust for people. Heck, I've even lost my relationship with my own mother because of this. 

 Anyways, I'm scheduled to move into a place in the middle of January, but until then I'm out in this cold weather. I'm from a smaller town about an hour or so from DC in Virginia. Which in return has limited shelter space and resources. The shelter is double full basically every night. Social workers point me every direction. Anyone have an ideas on what I should do? I start working next week thankful, but I'm losing more steam everyday out here.  Ideas? Comments? Any helpful tips to keep my head up? I'll try to respond as quickly as I can. 

Thank you so much for your time,
Justin ",2
So I don't want to be here anymore but I'm also too much of a sissy to do anything about it. I'm just stuck in this shitty fucking limbo. Please help me. I need to either get brave enough to end my life or get brave enough to sort it out. ,5
"I bought a Groupon to have my house cleaned.

They just left.

They couldn't do everything, I still have areas of my carpet to steam vac (I have cats, vomit, poop and hair factories), but three toilets in the house are now spotless and the kitchen is gleaming and they cleaned the kitchen floor which had a ton of cat paw prints all over it.

I feel guilty for spending money to have some ladies in to do that when I am able bodied and have working limbs and all, but I feel like I can just breathe and relax looking around.

If you're not stressed by people rearranging things and can afford to have someone in, I cannot recommend it enough to help your state of mind.",5
First of all i got depression over 2 years ago. Im not the guy who talks to much about it. I dont mind to talk about it but i think it should not be the thing that dominates my conversations. What i hate is when people with depressions do talk sooo much about them and their depressions! That is so self-centred and  their depression becomes some tool to get attention which is so annoying! This is at least how i feel. On a second thought i am like âwow should i talk more about my depressions? should i open myself?â Im confuesd because i also feel like an asshole for thinking like this. Pls let me know what you guys think about this!,4
"The tip of my nose actually looks swollen. It's like a sphere instead of being just a little curved. The center of my nose petrudes out like there's something not growing right. It looks disgusting.

I am really lanky. People say being tall is attractive but I manage to make it not.

My skin is like vomit brown. I hate it. It looks so gross. It's all scattered with like mini-pimple things?

My hair is some God forsaken mix between a bowl cut and something that doesn't yet exist, while tiny strands stick out everywhere.

I hate how I look. I'm sorry if I sound petty right now but this sub-reddit is to vent right? I just want to spew my thoughts out here. I apologize if this seems pathetic.

Now I feel like shit for feeling like shit about something so small. Yay.",4
"Have any of you lost a pet that you raised and were solely responsible for? My depression has gotten really bad again in the past 2 years and I've spent alot of that time in my room or depressed outside in a zoned out state of mind. One of my best buddies which was my Lovebird absolutely loved being around me. They are silly little birds and do really odd things and love to snuggle with you.

But with my depression I used alot of that time being by myself without my bird. Of course like most things you don't realize how incredibly important they are to you till it's too late. When I woke up to find Kiwi dead in her food bowl I was just devastated. It really didn't hit me bad till a few days later when I realized how she could of helped me during my depression and how my depression caused her to live a lonelier life as well. I knew it was my fault 100% why she died and looked into alot of things that I thought were safe for birds that did harm to her. 

I even did a proper funeral box for her, wrapped her in an orange towel, flowers, golden sacred art with quartz crystals and buried her in my backyard. 
It even got the people in the parrot sub to shed some tears. 

Time hasn't helped and I truly feel like a part of me, one of the few remaining pieces of happiness has been torn away from me. No matter what she always wanted to hang out with me and we've been through alot the 10 years I had her. I still remember coming back from the hospital after my suicide attempt where I was gone for a few weeks and when I came home she freaked out when she saw it was me, chirping and flying around the cage like she couldn't believe I was back. I used to meditate with her outside, play all types of games and now its all over.

Sometimes you get that one pet where it's just a really incredible bond and it sucks when something shitty like depression ruins the time I'll never get back with her along with the stress or loneliness I caused her.

If any of you have pets you love, really try to be with them more often to see if they will at least rid your mind of depression or at least have the comfort in knowing that your making them happen. It may not solve your problems but this whole situation has shown me how delicate life is. 

I don't know exactly the reason for this post, I just wanted to get my feelings out there in case any of you are animal lovers, try not to let depression destroy that friendship/bond where a pet can sometimes love you no matter what.",4

"Before I start, I just wanna say that I am in no danger of harming myself, I'm simply just going through a rough patch in life. 

I'm in the middle of winter break of my senior year of college and have never felt more lonely. Despite having a strong friend group at college and being in an amazing relationship with someone I love very much, I feel totally isolated. Many of my friends from college and my girlfriend live in the same town, while I live 3 states and 10 hours away from them. At home, I have found that, since starting college, all of my friends from high school have practically abandoned me. Despite seeing them frequently hanging out over the past 4 years on social media, I have yet to receive a response to any of the texts I've sent out, and, as a result, I find myself at home with no social life, thus causing a strong re-emergence of my depression that has pretty much taken over my thoughts. I live in a pretty rural area, so there aren't many ways to meet new people over break due to how spread out everything is and the extremely cold weather. While I've been able to spend some time with my family, my parents have to work most days. 

While my friends and girlfriend have been hanging out frequently, I've been delegated to sitting at home alone browsing through netflix. To make matters more difficult for me, I've been pretty open with my girlfriend about my situation but have found that she has been rather unresponsive due to a very active social life and busy family schedule at home. Its important to also understand that she has serious depression as well and recently moved to the town she's currently in 2 years ago and had some trouble meeting people as well, something with she has obviously overcome.  There have been one or two days where we've been able to text back and forth for a few hours, where I've been able to share my feelings with her about my break and have received helpful advice and comforting words in response; however a majority of our days have been delegated to a ""good morning"" text, one or two 5 minute check-ins throughout the day and a ""good night"". For example, on New Years Eve I was stuck at home alone (parents go to bed early) and asked my girlfriend earlier in the day if she'd like to talk for 5 minutes at midnight. Upon the drop of the ball, I simply receive a ""Happy New Years, I love you"" text, which I reply to asking if she wants to talk and then receive no response for the rest of the night until I said I'm going to bed to which she immediately responds good night. Due to my loneliness, I've tried to arrange some skype sessions or phone calls with her, because it'd be nice to have someone to actually talk to thats not my family, but have had little success. I find that some days I'll ask her if she'd like to have a phone call to which i recieve a ""maybe"" response, only to later find out that she made plans after our conversation to do something with her friends. I've been having trouble finding a way to communicate to her that it would be nice if I were to be able to skype of talk with her at least a few times over break while also trying to give her space to enjoy her time at home. I understand that she's been really busy, it just feels like she's made no efforts to try and talk with me. 

This situation has left me extremely conflicted about my life and my relationships. I know I tend to overthink things a lot when my depression re-emerges but I also find it frustrating that the person with whom I am closest doesn't seem to have a desire to talk to me. I'm hesitant to text some of my friends individually because I've never really had serious depression problems while I've known them and don't know how they'd handle it. I don't know how to cope with this situation I'm in. With graduation and adult life looming for me as well, I find myself anxious, lonely, depressed, and overthinking my entire life. The only friends I have I've made while in college and I will soon moving on from that stage of my life. I know that I'll still be friends with them in the future, but will likely be spread out across the country. I'm nervous that I will continue to have social troubles outside of college in the real world and find myself constantly googling how to make new friends in new places. Loneliness is one of my biggest fears in life and even facing it short term has unleashed a world of problems within me. 

I hope that this ""rant"" isn't too scatterbrained or jumbled, I just wanted to get it off my chest. I'm not sure if any of you have gone through similar situations but I figured I might as well reach out somewhere. ",4
"I can't be the only one putting myself down all the time? It's like when there is a brightening in the air, I find something wrong mostly with my body and I get frustrated, angry and sad at the same time. It's like I'm not meant to be happy and enjoy life...

It has made me lose my curiosity for life and all the things within it, understanding how something works, and I hate myself for it, as this have been one of the biggest drives for me in all my life. I could get excited just about a small idea popping in my head. Today no ideas are floating, my brain is empty, meds, depression or just myself? Even if some idea comes up I immediately put it down, because why bother? It won't work and if it does someone has already made something which is 100 times better than my solution... ",4
"Most of the time it's the opposite, but sometimes, when I get really depressed, I want to have sex or pleasure myself as much as I possibly can. I just feel worse afterwards, but I always do it. Don't know why it's like that sometimes. Perplexes me. Anyone have a similar experience? Just wanted to share.",4
"I got out of the army last year three months before I turned twenty eight and moved back into my mom and stepdads place because my credit was still ruined and I was still in debt from eight years earlier... because of my mom and stepdad. It's a long story and I won't go into detail but they stole money from me when I was twenty and it forced me into what seems to have been a perpetual road of nonstop failure and deep, deep, *deep* self loathing.

I injured myself in the army and got a nice chunk of permanent disability, making me set for the rest of my life. This is nice and all, but this wasn't my goal. I wanted to do my job in the army but no one ever elevated me. I wasn't hated either. That's the part I don't get. It seemed like everyone liked me but no one ever put even one extra second of effort to elevate me further. I watched everyone else get ahead as my physical state deteriorated and after four years, realizing I was going nowhere and was never going to get the qualifications to do my job on the inside or outside, opted for the medboard option.

When I got out I moved back home with my mom, stepdad, stepbrother and blood brother in a five bedroom prefab home because my credit still wasn't fixed, and what I saw enraged me. 

My mother had put on two hundred pounds, already weighing a sturdy four hundred. She'd sat in the same spot watching TV for the entire time I was in the army. My mom no longer abused me emotionally or physically but now she was doing this to my autistic stepbrother. She berated him daily. Even worse is that my stepdad was too wimpy to stop it and forked my mom over thousands upon thousands of dollars so she could buy fake little business licenses and crap off Amazon for the sole purpose of making sure no one else got my stepdads money... except for my brother.

I love my brother. He is my most prized person and we grew up together, but my mom has simply paid for him to sit on his ass and smoke weed, turning his mediocre hobby into a job with a whopping thirty thousand dollar ""loan"". I've never been treated this way. Since I was fourteen it was ""get a job"" while my brother was allowed to sit around and smoke weed while I busted my ass during all the best years of my life.

We lived out on eighty six acres and my mom wanted the land clear cut for some sort of farming operation, one of her hair brained schemes. It takes lots of time, money and machinery to clear cut eight six acres. She expected me to do it for free, by hand and with an axe. I said no.

At some point I began buying my own tools and storing them in the shed and would use them on and off again. Slowly I noticed they'd simply disappear. One day, when my mom thought I was gone, I watched her waddle into the shed, take a handful of my tools, walk them into the woods and toss them somewhere I could never find them. She'd toss my axes into the truck with the trash pile and take them to the dumpster. Nothing had changed. She was still hell bent on destroying my property and due to my credit I couldn't even get my own place. After three or four months of drinking, I broke and went to rehab.

I wound up moving in with my girlfriend. I won't badmouth her but we drifted apart during the army and she never got me on the lease, instead inviting a random girl to live with us who couldn't pay rent. Because I had no say, and things had fallen apart between us, it ended after a month and a half.

I moved back to a friend's uncle's place and for three months I got my finances in order. During this time I met up with a girl I'd known since middle school and had always had a crush on. Things went great. Our first date was awesome but she made it clear she was celibate and wanted to get married before having sex. It was annoying but like I said, I'd known her since middle school.

We dated for three months. Not like we were going out as girlfriend and boyfriend but going places and having deep discussions about our future lives together. Ya know, all that sappy relationship stuff.

We finally went on our final date and she invited her friend. The date was awesome... until her friend got drunk. We went camping for three days and on day three I assume her friend saw the attention she was paying to me and cut a nice wedge between us and berated me for hours. It wasn't anything I couldn't handle but sometime around midnight I fucking exploded after she made up another story and called me out for something that I wasn't even lying about. That night I asked the girl I was dating if this was worth pursuing and she crawled out of our tent and into her friends. She later claimed she was drunk and thought I made a move on her but it was worse than that, she'd had a boyfriend the entire time and was intentionally friend zoning me and hadnt expected me to find out if this was worth my time. 

It gets worse than that though, there was absolutely nothing between us, at least on her end. She hadn't been attracted to me one single bit. Even worse is that during our falling out discussion, she wouldn't even admit she had a boyfriend, I had to find out later through friends and hearsay. The last time I spoke to her she just cut me off for admitting how I felt and being upset but she never blocked or deleted me from Facebook. She just saw my messages for a month and would occasionally reply with a snippy one word answer until I blew up and forced her to block me. THIS finally seems to have broken me. A month or two earlier she talked me into getting an apartment on a year lease so we could have somewhere to hang out when she was in my neck of the woods, so now I'm fucking stuck with an apartment until August, in a part of town I moved to because I could find a free place to stay until I was able to get back on my feet, where I only know a small handful of people.

I am using my GI bill to go back to college and maybe I'll find some purpose and a woman to live my life with, but everyone my age is married with two kids and a house. I missed out on the entirety of my twenties, and blew it with a girl I'd known since the sixth grade and felt totally fucking berated. I haven't bothered to find anyone or make friends or even to make eye contact with anyone lately and have relapsed multiple times.

I just want to take my meager army money and buy land and be a fucking hermit and live the rest of my life wondering about what could have been if I'd been raised better by loving and hard working parents, or had opportunity, or had someone say ""you're next in line for success and great things"", but none of that happened. I don't think it's because I'm hated, because people genuinely seem to like me, but that's it. I'm just that guy with the pearly smile who's fun to talk to but nothing more. 

On a final note, I will say this. I got out of the army and I remembered how social I was *before* I joined, but once I got out I saw how everyone had moved on or had burned out. I'm in purgatory. Im somewhere between success and failure. I'll never hit rock bottom because my body gave out under the strain of army life, but I'll never make more than I work for in an entrepreneurial manner. I've thought about opening a bar or something like that but I've been denied a home loan and VA business loan so many times that it's now affecting my credit despite only having one tiny and insignificant debt left.

It doesn't matter I guess. I'm boring, I'm bored and I don't know what to do and the world has moved on from when I was young.

"I think I may do a good job filling up my schedule with the gym, library, chores, possibly school, and work. I still just know sitting at home during summer is going to suck balls. The winter is bearable as it's cold and most people are inside. Although knowing people are out having fun and you're inside is horrible. I can't take anymore of these lonely summers.",4
"Finally going to therapy for some long-standing issues. I'm pretty sure I've been in a low-key state of depression for the majority of the last 3 years. I've been going to therapy now for 3 months. However, I'm not sure if things are going the way they should be as I've never done it before, and have nothing to compare it to. 


**Here are some âprosâ  about my therapist:** 


- Specializes in my issues

- Good listener

- Empathetic 

- Takes my insurance so it's pretty affordable 

- I am comfortable being vulnerable around her and telling her everything


**Here are some things I find questionable. Please help me decide if this is normal:**


- Only took notes during the first session (I'm not sure if she takes notes after the session or not)

- No homework or things to work on. When I asked if there was something more I could do about a certain thought pattern, she said I was already doing it just by going to therapy. End of story. 

- No direction or check-ins. I do 99% of the talking. She never directs the conversation or checks-in about stuff we have talked about. She waits for me to initiate all talk. If I spent the entire session talking about some silly tv show I saw, she wouldn't direct it back towards anything. 

- Her responses to almost everything are âhow do you feel as you are saying that?â Or âthere are a lot of layers to your pain.â 

- Not sure that I'm making progress towards anything. It all just feels like I'm unburdening to a third-party. I don't feel better after my sessions and I don't feel like I've gotten any better. 

- I have twice asked her if I should be on antidepressants. Both times, she seemed reluctant to even talk about it. We left off both times with me being no more clear about whether or not I should pursue this, how to go about getting a prescription (can she do it? Do I go to my family doctor? Either way, she never gave me my options or how to move forward)


If this is normal to therapy, I'm happy to continue going. What I would like to avoid is getting trapped with someone who may hold me back from actually making concrete progressions towards being healthy and whole. Should I stick it out?",4
When will I find someone  who'll love me forever and ever ,4
"It's not going well. Failed business ventures. Midlife crises. Parents at the end of their respective lines and ready for the trash bins. Siblings being beaten by their terribly scripted lives. 

I am having a hard time relating to anyone anymore about anything. I am always trying to fix it all, and I am always failing miserably, after all this time and all these years. 

It's always the same thing. It's like a funny story I have told too often. I still find it funny, but I don't laugh any more.

I liken it to having a serious head cold that won't go away. It pounds like mad and all I can do is hope it runs its course. And, it never runs its course.

The real irony, however, is as worthless as I feel, I still can't help feeling lonely.",4
"I'm always there for people who want to talk to me when they're sad, as I've done this many times in the past, but there is no a single who I can turn to when I'm sad. Goddamn, I literally the person who hurgs others when they cry; yet, they can't even reply a simple message.

No matter how shitty my days been I always have my shows to come home and binge watch. It doesn't require effort or even full concentration. Plus it's like 500 episodes so I'm not going to be done anytime soon,5
"I should have done this a long time ago.

Let me begin by saying that I am a proud man.  I like to think I'm self-sufficient, and that I'm equipped to deal with the crap the world throws at me.  I'm not accustomed to asking for help, especially when it comes to my illness.  You see, no one in my family knows I suffer from chronic depression, because I have never been diagnosed as such.  But the truth is I've spent the majority of my entire life battling self-loathing, feelings of hopelessness, and thoughts of suicide.  And as I slog through what must certainly be a mid-life crisis, it's getting harder and harder to deal with on my own.

I am very slight of build, and I was bullied mercilessly as a child and teenager.  I learned to fight back, and have spent most of my life unwilling to put up with others' crap.  That has really hurt me socially and professionally, because everyone thinks I'm an asshole.  I'm now in my 40s, and I don't have any friends anymore, and don't really have much to do with my family, other than my mother.  I love her, and she loves me, but she's a tyrant.  She has supported me financially for years, and she's not afraid to remind me of that at every opportunity.  She's approaching her 70s now, and her health is deteriorating, leaving me as the only member of the family who would even consider caring for her (everyone else in my family draws disability or welfare, even though they're each perfectly capable of working, but none of them would lift a finger to care for my mother, so that falls on me).

I went to college, where I did very well.  I have a bachelors degree in music education, but after graduating I discovered fairly quickly that I can't stand children (much less their overbearing parents).  So I am now thousands of dollars in debt (student loans) that I can't afford to pay, all for a degree in which turned out to be a waste of time. I was never a particularly stellar performer, so that avenue is closed to me as well.  However, I've spent the past 20 years writing and arranging music for school bands and band instruments in a bid to validate going to college in the first place and salvage some sort of professional career, and some dignity.  Unfortunately, composing and arranging pays little to no money...certainly not enough to pay bills or better myself.  The truth is, I'm an outcast in that world, because again, I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to tell music teachers when they're not doing a good job.  So I feel that door has closed as well.

Since graduating college, I've had to resort to what amounts to a string of odd jobs which I've absolutely hated.  Customer service, human resources, retail, grocery, sales....all soul-crushing, tedious jobs that have always made me feel like a complete and utter failure in life, and wishing that writing music was a sustaining career.  

About 10 years ago, I got involved in a relationship with a woman who nearly ruined my financially.  It took me a long time to bounce back from that, but I did.  I had to move back home, though.  Unfortunately, since then, I've had an incredibly difficult time finding work at all.  I live in the rural south, where the only good paying jobs are in nursing and truck driving (neither of which I can do, nor would ever want to).  I can't even get a job flipping burgers or working in a grocery store, because I'm a man in my 40s with a degree, and am (according to employers and staffing managers) overqualified for anything short of, according to them, brain surgery.  Factories won't hire me for the same reason (and also because I cannot lift more than 40 pounds).  I'm subscribed to dozens of different job websites, and can't count the number of times I've nearly been scammed by fraudulent job listings...the sort that prey upon desperate people like me.  I've wasted thousands of dollars in gasoline driving to places of business in order to apply, only to be told ""You have to apply online"", and am then ridiculed by friends and family who assert ""You have to go meet employers face to face if you want to get hired"".  

In the past I've actually moved around the country in order to find work, but I've always been held back by 1). There's no such thing as a permanent full time job anymore, and 2). The extremely high cost of living, and anyway, as my mother gets older, that's no longer an option.  I'm stuck here, and I'm going broke.  If it weren't for my mother, I would be homeless, and just a few days ago she informed me that ""we're"" moving from a decent house in a quiet neighborhood to a mobile home next to a railroad....the last thing in the world my ego and self-esteem need right now.

I don't have health insurance.  I can't even afford it.  The state I live in doesn't offer Medicaid,  the premiums are too expensive on even the cheapest plans, and the copays at my local health department are too expensive.  My student loan is on deferment until they get tired of me requesting deferments (which may very will be next month).  I've been dealing with internal and external hemorrhoids for a decade, and I can't afford even have them looked at, much less do anything about it.  And I certainly can't afford therapy, or counseling, or medication for this depression.   Coupled with the fact that I don't even want to get out of bed most days, combined with the fact that I'm not getting any younger...I'm beginning to see the writing on the wall.

I'm a proud man.  I don't like to ask for help.  I don't want to apply for welfare or financial assistance, because 1). I most likely wouldn't qualify for it, and 2). to me, that's admitting total defeat, and surrendering any shred of dignity I have left.  I certainly don't like to ask for help from strangers on the internet, because frankly, I think it's a total waste of time and effort.  But I can feel a darkness creeping up on me, preparing to strangle the very life out me.  I see no hope for a future.  It just makes me so angry.  I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I've stayed out of trouble, and I don't bother anyone.  I worked very hard to better myself and, for my part, I've been a good person.  I don't care about money or wealth.  I just want a sense of purpose in life.  I want to be able to pay my bills and actually buy things I want rather than just what I need.  I want to be respected for my talents, and maybe even remembered when I'm gone.  But all of that seems totally out of reach now.  It's infuriating to see my suggested earning potential on job sites ($89,000 per year, btw), and then get a prospectus from Social Security letting me know that as of right now, when I turn 65 I'll only get $330 a month.  That makes it feel like everything, my education, my work history, my entire life...has all been for nothing.

I don't know what to do.  I applied for over 20 jobs today, and I won't hear back from a single employer because I'm a forty-something with a college degree.  I'm tired of being supported financially by my ailing mother.  I want to support HER.  I want to be able to afford an apartment at the very least, and not have to move into a damn trailer less than 20 feet from railroad tracks.  I want her to be proud of me.  I want my college professors to be proud of me.  I want to be proud of myself.  

But part of me also wants off this ride.  Part of me is afraid things are not going to get better.  How can they?  I'm running out of ideas.  I'm running out of options.  And I'm running out of patience.  I just don't know what else to do.

"22m. I take treatment for anxiety and depression. I don't know if it's helping or not, because some days, both before and after starting the SSRI, I feel normal and friendly, others I feel angry and unable to have a conversation with anyone because I fear talking to other people so much, and also because the thoughts and images in my head are racing so fast I cannot slow them down fast enough to collect a thought to speak. I only answer either âyesâ or ânoâ on those days. I could have a few normal days in a row only to have them followed by a week of being afraid of everything. My eyes have been also more sensitive to light lately, if that means anything. 

In the background of all this is a strange sensation that I've been told by several people is only a symptom of depression. I have no emotions or interests. I don't want to talk or see anyone. Nothing in the world around me seems real, I don't recognize myself or my thoughts, and I feel as though I'm watching myself go through the motions of life. Thoughts of my death and killing myself randomly enter my head every day, sometimes for no reason at all and other times is I'm uncomfortable or embarrassed, but I've never thought seriously about harming myself. It's more as though it's a thought I observe and don't interact with. I don't know why, but my day-to-day thoughts make me feel as though I am an aged older man than a 22-year-old. It's like my brain feels exhausted. My questions though: is this normal? How do other people deal with this if so? My head just makes me want to never leave my bed, ",5
"I've been dating this guy who treats me like a million bucks- and respects me, my opinions, makes sure we talk everything through when there's an issue, voices his feelings, asks me to see him in person when he wants to bring something up so there's no misinterpretation, brings me flowers on my hard days at work, answers me, always, notices all the little things, like my random upper cheek dimple, the way I bite my lip when I'm concentrating, and how I tuck my hair behind my ear when I'm nervous.

And here I am, unable to feel strongly about him, never responding to him on time, flaking out on seeing him, constantly.

"Like the name say, I just don't feel right. Do I am an alien? Human are supposed to be social creature and I don't really feel social. Also I don't feel I like I'm a teenager, all teenager of my age (I'm a 18 yrs old male guy) like partying, alcohol and drug while me I hate parties and stuff, I'm getting depressed and I feel like I'm the only clean teenager who doesn't like partying, I'm starting to feel alone in this shitty world...
(I don't know where to place this, I felt both need help in social and depressed...)


More context, I feel people are always talking and me I just say nothing, I wish I could talk but I can't think of anything, I don't know what to say... People may think: your conversation skill are bad, sure yeah I have trouble talking to people but when I feel people listen to me, they like me, they talk to me and I know what to say it's kinda a knife slicing into butter even some people say it to me.

But I get depressed, I feel WAY too different from guy of my age, everyone are like: partying everydays, having tons of friends, drinking beers, sex, drug... and me I prefer staying at home playing video games, being online, taking no drug, having no sex (Well I kinda want that one but I got no girlfriend and I don't wanna pay that shit) and feel not comfortable at parties or in social groups.

Today, there was a social meeting or party at my job with almost all the staff, I felt that was like one of the worse decision of my life... It's not that I hate people there I like everyone there and can talk to them normally but I just felt too different and alone there. There like two persons arround my age and normally there that girl I can talk to her but today meh... she was talking to the other guy and I kinda felt ignored because I don't say anything... For me, people talk unless you talk to them but what you do when you have nothing to say and how do you reverse the situation? (That people talk to you instead)",4
"So I got a psychosis and it really sucked, it was the scariest experience in my life by far. I've googled the way people get help with the psychosis etc. But it's basically meds...

"I was recently diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, OCD, and depression. I met with a on-campus counselor and after several sessions I was referred to a psychiatrist, and after several meetings with him and with other professionals I was finally diagnosed (took almost a year).

The fucking issue is I can't get help at all, all of the psychiatry work was done at a near by mental hospital. And the counseling was done on campus, I was referred to several therapists/psychologists/specialists/etc to continue work but I don't have a car and counseling on campus is very limited in the amount of sessions you can do (10 per 2 semesters/or per issue).

So I'm fucked because I can't afford any of my medications because I'm a poor American and thus don't have healthcare and can't afford medication, I don't have a car and there a no therapists near by me that I can walk to or ride the bus too.  ",2
"Sorry for the very melodramatic title. The point is, i have suffered from depression and I have gotten over it about 2 years ago, but everything that goes a little downhill in my life spurs this fear that I might not be able to be ""normal"". This isn't a cry for help or anything useful at all, but I'm just writing this for personal solace. However I am interested to see if anybody who has gone through depression has this same fear of going back into the cycle.",5

I'm also semi-seriously making career / retirement plans, and thinking about the futures of my parents and niblings and sister and in-laws. But none of this has any substantial meaning to me.

"Hi, I've had pretty bad depression and anxiety issues since i was in middle school and have pretty much hated myself ever since i can remember. I'm also an introvert and generally cant stand to be around people other than a select few. I Went to a therapist early in highschool who said i had some form of depression, but my parents never really followed through getting any medication for me (i dont think they really believe depression is a problem). I've been in a pretty huge slump since I've been out of high school (almost 4 years) compounded by the fact that just recently my best friend decided he would check out early. I want to get some professional help before things get any worse. I have a job and insurance but not a lot of money. I am not suicidal (i guess i was up until recently and i found out how bad being on the other end feels), but now that this is no longer an option i feel like i am just trapped in a 100 foot hole with no way out. 

Really i am posting because i have questions i am hoping to have answered by anyone with experience on the subject.

1. Is a general practice doctor usually someone who can prescribe anti depressants? Im not sure my insurance would cover any sort of mental health doctor.(i generally hate doctors and pharmaceuticals and avoid both at all costs, hopefully until now as i cant really see any other resolution)
2. How do i know if they(drugs) would even help? Any particular  ""feelings"" they prevent? 
3. Do they help with anxiety or would that be something else? 
4. Do they affect you physically? (Weight gain/loss, energy, ect.)
5. Generally speaking are any of the pharmaceuticals i might be prescribed expensive?

Thanks for any help/advice anyon can give in advance.",4

It's like if I'm enjoying myself heaps, like laughing with friends or watching cute animals, and realise that I'm having fun, and that thought triggers myself to say to myself that I will never be happy and this is a fleeting moment, and that thought itself acts as âevidence that I'm depressed' which goes back into the cycle of negativity which de-purifies whatever enjoyment I'm feeling.

It gets me through my ruts in life by making me feel nothing. But at the same time, it's so pathetic. It keeps me from doing things I enjoy, and it makes me feel worthless and hopeless. It makes me think about suicide a lot too because I start to think about my future, like what the point is in living or if I can really handle anymore pain. (What is the point in life anyway? Work until you die?) But then it gets even worse when I realize I can't end it, because of personal obligations based on relationships and religion. (Plus I'd never get to finish dark souls.

Then I managed to meet a girl at my new job and I fell in love with her. Everything about her was perfect for me and I felt like we bonded really well, except for the fact that she had a boyfriend. She was unhappy with her relationship and I hoped to help her get out of a toxic relationship and make her my own. Today she friendzoned me and said she's staying with her boyfriend, and now I'm completely alone all over again with no friends and nobody I care enough about to live for. Sure, my family might care for a couple weeks but after that I would be forgotten forever if I was gone. I have no motivation to go and make new friends and I feel like if I talk to any new girls I'm just going to think about this first girl and want her back.

"Hello, my name is Pranav. I am an 18 year old guy, living in India, currently in the last year of school with about 50 days to go before my final examinations. A lot depends upon my performance in these exams - most importantly, my dream of studying in Canada, and the image and respect that I've built for myself all these previous years.

**I am not at all prepared for the exams!** For 2 years now I've been struggling with inner demons (procrastination, severe escapism, depression). I went to a shrink, I took pills (stopped 4 months ago), I even saw a pseudo-psychologist with radical methods which were helpful (short-term) but very oppressive. No longer doing that either.

I have a great life, loving parents and brother, and all the comforts, leisures and resources one might need. I have potential and ambition, **but no drive**. Sometimes I feel as if I am just lazy, worthless or stupid in some way. I am certainly pitying myself, which is the worst. No surprise that I've often contemplated suicide but never did it.

I never stopped researching my own condition and I believe that I have finally come across **one helpful treatment**. It's called Metacognitive Therapy (MCT). But as it turns out, I suck so much that I didn't stick with it either!

**NOW,** here I am. A well-endowed and capable human being, with tools and knowledge. I know what to do. What action to take. But I feel shitty all the time and keep wandering off to wasting time. I got rid of my computer but I cannot do away with video games.

I feel shitty, stupid, guilty, insecure, helpless and like a failure. I am on a self-made ride for self-destruction. I have the tools and **ONE LAST SHOT AT SALVATION**. But I am guilty of self-sabotage [I have all the information that I need but I just can't break free from the vicious cycle of inaction and also **I keep gorging new information, especially spiritual stuff** even though I don't need it!]. I need help. Help and support that none around me can provide (without being judgemental). I feel lost and at the mercy of fate.

Thank you for hearing me out.",2
"How do you talk to people about depression, either about your own or theirs? Do/don'ts?",4
"Since I don't really know where to start, might as well go with the grief portion and build outwards.

My mother died almost a year ago now. We're a small family, me an only child, and I am very lucky to have a close relationship with my parents, my mom especially. She has always been the type to 'mom' me and she was an emotional support that I never truly appreciated.

Her death was sudden and unexpected because, as she did, she hid her own issues from me to lessen my burden. I still remember getting the call out of nowhere and my world crashing around me. While I am blessed with an amazing extended family, it's just Dad and me to carry on and he doesn't really get it. His go-to is dark humour which I frankly can't handle and I don't know if I ever will. He is also much more prepared for this, having known my mom was struggling as she was. He also doesn't understand mental illness, specifically depression, except to say that I should try being happier.

Which leads to the other side of this wombo-combo. I'm in a new city for school and the fall before my mom died, my only circle of friends (who also happen to be my co-workers) cast me out in a spectacular gaslighting endeavor that destroyed any self-confidence I had. I was told things I felt going on around me were all in my head, that I was imagining tension that wasn't there, and I should just chill.

Fast-forward to 2 days before my mom died and I get a request to meet from one of the more vocal of the group. I was on the phone with my mom, the last phone call I would ever have with her, and told her I had to go meet with this person. In that meeting, I'm told that everything I thought was going on, was actually going on (contrary to the months of gaslighting prior) and that I'm essentially a terrible person who deserved it. But, this person was willing to show me mercy and permit me to re-join this circle on the condition that I change everything about my personality.

I was so lonely, so isolated, that I consented. I began to believe the lies about how horrible I was and within 24 hours, I was on the floor of my apartment, crying and trying to determine the best way to end my life because I saw no reason for a worthless, horrible person like myself to exist. I had decided to go get a knife when the phone rang with an unexpected call from a friend back home which broke through my thoughts long enough to break the cycle in my head.

I wrote to our collective supervisor about the situation and went to lay down as I was having intense chest pain. The next day, I woke up and my mother had died of heart failure/heart attack (we didn't have an autopsy done).

So here I am, back in my isolation. My supervisor has ignored my repeated attempts to bring this issue to light as the situation has not improved at work at all in the last year. I've hidden myself away in my apartment, and I feel like I'm dying inside.

I have so much guilt over cutting my phone call short with my mom to deal with this insane mind game. I have anger over these people stealing my energy from what's important. I still feel worthless for being unable to get past this. I just feel so much pain. I wish with all my being my mom was still here and I feel like I'm disappointing her by being unable to get my life back on track. I feel as though I'm drowning on the inside and no matter who I tell or what I say, all I hear is that 'you can do this' or 'just stay positive'. I am positive, and I can be positive, but that doesn't help when my depression sets in and my heart is breaking. I just want someone to actually hear me when I say how much agony I am carrying inside.",4

But, recently (like a week), I haven't been able to write anything, I haven't talked to any of my friends, and I have a ton of trouble even talking with my girlfriend because...

I don't know if he just isn't the kind of talking person or if he doesn't actually care - it was a mutual friend of ours and he knows that. 

When I watch tv programmes or see news articles of people getting raped I get really angry, I think this might be when I start thinking about ways I could die. If I was dead I'd never have to be reminded or think about rape again. 

Some days my thoughts overwhelm me and I don't want to get out of bed. I want to get up and have a nice day but something just seems to stop me. I don't know what and I just feel really shit and down.

"Dunno, it striked in my head, I just writed : 

""The whole bid for submission by current managerial values is based on almost one mistake: the confusion between working and fulfilling one's potential""


Have it something right ? I'm speaking of course about the social way we are seeing work. In the way work as it is socially understood, is really one dimensionnal, like if somewhat every competency that humanity was able was separated in each individual, impacting view of life of each. We are always referencing to the quote ""work is tripalium"" and stuff in social term.
Imo it's at least currently (while not in IA society :) ) a false idea to modify work, because while there is a hierarchy/domination, even from outside workforce (government manage work activities while work hierarchie = smooth/flat), there will be always some form of resistance finishing with creating new morality, new idea, and cutting off what work are mean to do : producing for surviving as a species.


Accomplishing your potential mean you use actually fun, you use imagination, you use discipline, you use your emotions, you use self control, you use your ability to introspect, you use your memory, perhaps ultimately a excellent work would be one that reflect the most the life wich all are actually living, meaning you have to use your memory in a global way, not being limited by artificial rule we are creating. A real work have part of actually not working, and not being managed for not working as it happen in homosexual company in silicon valley.

Isn't it a problem for those who are seeking actual accomplishment  ? I don't mean forcibly extra uppa uda mega accomplishment, just for the stuff itself. There is ppl wich are actually working better in choosen activities / in hobby mode. Aren't you more concentrated in this place than in work ? I'm not saying that writing in reddit is a higher accomplishment than your work, probably not if you are in IT for example, but writing here require more completeness than doing 1 repetitive task for all the month there another one then another one...

The main problem with trying to submit ppl with moral (like in our typical managemental way of seeing the work world) is that it end with devaluing moral itself more than being in a complying/not complying problem",2
"We are generations of people who gave up. And there are many reasons why but I don't think that we are the reason. 

Jordan Peterson talked in one of his lectutes about a 2 year critical time  right around the age of 1 and 2 where we need human interaction the most. Thats where we learn the most social standarts. What I think is that since we stopped living in villigas and small communities we lack heavily in human interactions. There are places like kindergarden but they are too late. In germany there is a kita wich is for even younger children. The main thought for these is that the parents can go to work. That the wrong goal. These should be for social interaction teaching children how to get along. And how to deal with their own emotions by putting them in diffenet situations in fun games. 

Also children and teenager should be forced to get human interaction. I mean if you k ow how to meet new people and how to communicate with them because you are too anxious (as me) to do the first step then it will be extreamly difficult to get better in this on your own!

Also I think our world looks just dirty and filthy. That is no enviourment to be happy around and when you live in a place like me (germany) where it rains almost all day you are fucked if you are allready depressed. 

What I also think thaz we are missing is that we need proper educations in basic hygene and how important it is. I see too many small children running arou d with really bad breath. Or they just smell aweful in general. If they won't build a bsaic hygene routine now it will be extreamly difficult in the future. 

And finally we lack on proper thinking. As carlsagan said ""science is a way of thinking"" But we never get educated in this. They all expect us to know how to think scientificly. We should just have one  class where they give us problems sometimes basic and sometimes hard but they should never be such problem wich yoz can learn. Everyproblem need to be diffrent and should all be solvable by thinking scientificly. 

I think if all people had this basic skill sets allot of people would be less depressed and more motivated to do thinks because you would know how to solve problems wven if they were totally new and with unknow parameters for you.

Sorry for the long text but Idk where to post this else where then here since this is one way to prevent most of the depressions (like mine).

This is my story of quiting my job to travel the world and follow what I thought my passion was.

So for the past 6 months I have been planning to quit my job so I can start a travel vlog channel on YouTube and work on photography and film making. I bought some gear, I even got free products from companies because they believed in my vision. I honestly thought this was it, like I thought this was going to be my thing. I thought I was on the right path doing this. I thought this would be my dream. I thought travelling the world sharing my pics and videos would make me happy and fullfilled. So after 6 long months, the big day finally arrived. I was so excited guys like I was over the moon about it all. This wasn't really a holiday for me this was my time to focus on my craft and work towards my goals in youtube, photography and film making. But honestly after a few days something started to change fast. I didn't really feel good, I felt like annoyed that I had to edit this vlog or edit this photo. I became very unhappy and unfulfilled extremely fast. The only time I felt good was when I was high on mushrooms and drunk on alcohol (that was for nye only) but I started to ask myself âhey do you even enjoy what you are doingâ and to be honest I didn't. I thought travelling the world sharing my journey with everyone would be fullfilling, I had friends and others tell me they were inspired that I had the courage to do this, I kinda felt like they were looking up to me and that my decision to do this would make them more confident for them to go after there dreams and I know that is a very positive thing but that wasn't motivating for me at all. 

I am a simple man. I don't give a **** about money or fame, pretty much my core value is to live a happy and fulliled life and to be surround by good people. The 9-5 isn't for me. Hats off to you if you are ok with it but for me personally I couldn't think of anything worse then sit in a box under arterfical light for 8+ hours a day t days a week plus the commute. When the realisation that the thing I thought was going to be my thing wasn't was the most crushing feeling I have ever felt. It got to the point where I almost broke down. 

I have had successful online businesses in the past, but even when they were successful I wasn't happy because I quickly realised this is like a 9-5 where I am only doing it for the money, I felt no joy or fullfillment from it so I quit. I currently do crypto investing, doing alright with it. Made 2k today but honestly yet again I felt no joy front that. I think a lot of people see other people's lives on tv or social media and say to themselves âI want that lifeâ I was the same, but I quickly realised I was sold a lie. Some of you might comment saying âyou are just depressed broâ honestly I don't think I am, I believe 99% of depression cases are miss diagnosed. I believe a lot of it has to do with people living unfullfied lives. Yes maybe 1% have a chemical imbalance but I strongly believe majority of people are not happy because they are not living unfullfied lives 

Right now I am thinking of just going home take some time off to revaluate. I must say though this really is painful this feeling. Thinking that something is going to be your passion and honestly believing in the bottom of your heart this is your thing but then realising (especially so fast) that' it's not is depressing. I just wanted to make you aware that the whole âquit your job to travel the world thingâ might sound cool and all but I promise you it's not going to make you happy. To me the only way to live a happy and fullfilled life is to do things you actually enjoy, to be on a road and to actually have some sort of direction.",2

"I have seen the same therapist for four years twice a week. We generally meet on the same day, same time, but that's not fixed in stone. 

There have been occasions where both of us cancel sessions due to sickness, emergency or family issue. That's not a problem.

My therapist was scheduling my appointments for this month and the first week of the month was booked when my time to schedule came.

She put me on a wait list.

I didn't expect a call mostly due to logistics. 

How did I feel? I was triggered. I felt ignored and taken for granted, but I didn't say anything because that means I have confront one of my demons.

My therapist has mentioned several times in the past months that she has a long waiting list of potential clients. Again, I didn't say anything to avoid a possible confrontation.

Folks, I'm going to be in therapy a long time, a long, long time. Why? That's what helps me from running off the road. 

Is it reasonable to ask my therapist that I would appreciate a call to schedule appointments if her schedule is filling up?

Should ask her is she trying to tell me something about her waiting list?

My therapist is very good at her job. However, I've learned the way not to get too comfortable with any mental health professional. ",4
"Hey guys, this is my first post in a long time back on reddit because I quit for awhile to try and sort myself out.

Well life has hit me really hard again lately, so here I am.

I'm just wondering if any of you can relate to never being excited as a kid? Or like things that were supposed to excite you made you anxious/embarrassed? 

For instance, I hated going on vacations with my family. I did not find them fun at all. I hated going to amusement parks and field trips because everyone around me would be having so much fun and I just couldn't. I rarely got excited on any holiday except a little bit on Christmas because it was the only time of year when everything around me seemed to calm down and people seemed to be genuinely nice to each other. I never thought my birthday was a big deal and never wanted parties, even though I had a good amount of friends. I just feel like this isn't normal for a kid and maybe I am actually clinically depressed, BUT I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A DIAGNOSIS. ",4
"I believe I have struggled  with depression and anxiety for a long time but the past year or so seems to have dramatically increased it. 

So here's the story: 
I had been working a job at a tire shop which I didn't not enjoy with people I didn't get along with. I was seeing a girl who was in an open marriage who eventually became my best friend and biggest supporter.
I was giving the opportunity by a buddy's parents to join the merchant marines and go to the seafearers school in piney point. I was not sure if I would like it but his mom was very persistent that I do it and since joining the military was always a dream of mine but was out of the question due to my past, I agreed.
I have always separation anxiety for some reason, even though I have never felt particularly close to much of anyone or anything. I knew I would miss my family and friends and skydiving (which at one time was the only thing that really made me happy) and booze but I went into the seafearers program with all the promises of a wonderful, rewarding career making more money that I could spend. 
Well, needless to say, the ""school"" was not the prestigious, academy in which I was told. It was more or less a free labor, brain washing institution full of ignorant criminals and, pretty sure, illegal immigrants, ran by a union which I'm pretty sure is a mob front.  None the less, I got through the first phase of the school. The girl I had been seeing at home was very supportive and we texted everyday as we had for the entire year we had known each other. I was working out everyday and was reading a few self help books to try to help cope with being away from everything at home. 
Immediately after the first phase of school, you are sent directly on to a ship which I was assigned with two others from my class, one was a guy I got along with pretty well and the other was the biggest piece of shit I have ever met in my life. There were good and bad days but to be honest I really wasn't into it, working everyday and only making $35/day however, I kept telling myself that it was a good experience and that it would be better next time. We did have shitty internet on the ship so I could communicate with my family, which was rare, but again the girl would text me everyday.
So  that tour was done after 90 days being on the ship in the middle east. Time to go home, finally.
I went home with almost no money, still living with my parents but after over 7 months, was ready to see everyone again and the girl I had left behind and to finally skydive again. This is were things turned for the worse. I soon realized that the  warm welcome home I had hoped for wasn't what I had coming. Most of the time I sat around my house drinking alone frustrated with myself, my finances, the fact that I was 26 with almost no money, no real friends, still living at my parents who are having to pay my bills while I'm trying to get through the rest of this program, still hoping that it will be worth wild. The girl I had been talking to the past year was always busy and seemed to never have much time to hang out and we began arguing more and more because, being the jealous person I am, wanted to be with her all the time. I kept skydiving on the weekends but eventually, it became frustrating to me as well and lost most of the joy it once brought me. There were many time I would hope for a malfunction that would let me go in or times when I would consider simply not pulling. 
After about a month I went back to the âschoolâ to do the third phase. I got through it and even through all our issues me and the girl who I was now very much in love with, still texted back and forth everyday. Adding  to my self hatred, I was in love with a married woman. Everyday at the school, my class seemed to be in trouble for something. Losing the few privileges that were available to us and getting assigned daily extra detail. After two long months, it was over and time to go home and await shipping assignments. I was pretty sure I wanted nothing to do with this union at this point but didn't want to let my buddy's parents down, they had put a lot of effort into me doing this and really wanted me to go through with it. So I decided to go home and wait for them to give me my assignment. At this point, it has been almost a year since I have made any real money and having my parents and grandmother paying the few bills I had which made me feel terrible. 
When I got home, the same problems as last time. I felt alone, completely alone. 
There was a part of me that was looking forward to shipping again. As this time I would actually be making a wage. After about a month of waiting, I was assigned a ship which I was hoping to get to see some interesting ports and make some money. Well got on and found out there is no internet and the only way to contact anyone was through a terrible company email program. Found that my wage was basically bullshit with my overtime rate being $12/hour and then I saw the ship schedule, fucking middle east again with only a few ports on the way that we were allowed to get off at for maybe an hour or two. On top of that, the cooks were awful. There was hardly a week that went by were someone wasn't sick from the food. Then, about 2 weeks into the voyage crossing the Atlantic,  my laptop charger was surged and ruined so I couldn't access the four terabytes of movies and books on my hard drive I had downloaded for the trip. I was able to get off in a port in Italy to try to find another charger but ended up having to buy a whole new computer just for the charger I needed.
Somehow while at sea, my debit card had been used in China for almost $800. I was able to have that taken care of but my card was canceled giving me no access to my money until I could get home to activate the new card they had sent me.
Then we got stuck in Beaumont Texas due to hurricane Harvey for weeks. One night, after things were beginning to open back up, me and another guy went out on the town. To get in and out of the port from the ship, you have to be escorted by port police from the ship to the gate and vis versa. Upon returning to the ship, I was sitting in the backseat in the middle with the other guy in the front passenger seat and the port police officer driving. The idiot cop wrecked the police truck directly into a concrete support beam sending my face flying into the steel divider of the police truck busting up my face and sending me to the hospital. After getting stitched up and a few days bac on the ship, I was eventually sent home.
Back home again, I was sent to a doctor and complained about upper back pain that radiated into my neck and shoulder pain. They told me to do physical therapy 3 times a week at their facility for 4 weeks without them taking x-rays or anything. I did that reluctantly, constantly asking to be referred to a specialist to have an mri done on my upper back and shoulder. After the therapy the doctor finally ordered an mri on September 25th. It took me a month of fighting back and forth between the shipping company and the union insurance company to get the mri  and finally got it done October 25th, the day after my birthday. Finally, I thought but come to find out, he ordered an mri on my upper neck. Not my back or my shoulder. At my follow up appointment, when confronted about it, he assured me that it was suppose to be my shoulder and back but after leaving the room for 3 hours, he returned to say that he thought my neck was more of an issue than  my shoulder at the time. My neck only hurt from the pain that was in my back which I made sure to express from day one. I asked if he was going to reorder the mri to actually look at the problem to which he replied no that I would have to deal with the pain for the rest of my life because there was nothing else he could do and he cleared me to go back to work even though I could hardly move my head, sit up straight, or lift my shoulder.
Over the next month I had hurt my knee somehow but hoped it would eventually get better. It would lock up if I bent it and the only way to get it unlocked was to go down to ground on my knees and sit back on my feet. The girl I was in love with at this point and I continued to see each other but seemed like less and less, maybe a few times a month. We went out one day I had decided to cut back on the drinking and got very drunk to the point I had to cut her off and take her back to my house. She wanted to have sex but I told her no because she was so drunk but she kept trying. She started telling me things like âwith you it's different, I don't feel like  a piece of meat like everyone elseâ I asked her who is everyone else and she told me she gets paid to have sex and she was a prostitute. I didn't believe her but was insistent, trying to find a so called website she was apparently on and showing me text messages from people she said she was only friends with before where she has been sending nude pictures and explicit messages. When she woke the next morning I confronted her about it to which she had no recollection and admitted to seeing and having sex with multiple other men and women but not the whole being a prostitute or getting paid for sex which she still denies to this day. Being the only person I have ever felt like I could talk to, I still talk to her, which makes me hate myself. 
Over the next few weeks I hurt my other knee and had surgery on both meniscus. I was told I would be back walking in a few days with full recovery in a few weeks before I went in for surgery.  I went in for surgery and my mom had taken me and the girl that broke my heart asked to be there, I agreed to it and they both waited during the surgery. I woke up in leg braces being told that it was worse than they thought and that I would be in leg braces for up to 10 weeks. No skydiving, no rock climbing, no running or working out, no walking except to and from the bathroom with crutches. I couldn't believe it.
Today is the end of week 4 of being confined to my bed in my parents house to which I live. Only being able to go out for therapy and almost no one has came to visit me. The girl has a few times but it's awkward and I keep trying to find a way to forgive her and some way to trust her, why, I guess I feel like she's all I have. My mom has been having to do pretty much everything for me which I can't stand. I sit here all day in bed frustrated, bored, depressed, worrying, hating everything that has happened, wondering what could possibly be next until I finally just give up and start downing any alcohol I can get my hands on. Back and shoulder still messed up. Haven't heard anything about being able to see another doctor about that issue. Also, about a week before surgery, my clutch went out in my car. I ordered a new clutch and flywheel and rushed to get it put in before my surgery. I did but after a few hours I noticed something wasn't right. I took the transmission back out and discovered that the paint on the flywheel melted and let the bolts holding it to the crank come loose and one snapped off. So now my car is torn apart in my dads garage possibly needing a new crankshaft.

I am constantly trying to tell myself that there is someone else out there that is way worse off than me which I know is true and that is shouldn't complain and that things will get better but at this point, I'm no longer so sure.

"So I have been effed up in life several times. I've got quite a background with depression , rejection and bullying. I'm 21 and I feel like my life is already doomed, like there is no way out of this.

I've been struggling with paradoxical feelings, because I met a girl who I've fallen in love with, but she has bpd and got a full time job. We rarely speak now, only in March will she be available again. She makes me feel good about myself, like the only thing that truly makes me happy. I care about her so much, so I am letting her set her life straight and not talk to her. She's rarely in the mood anyways, as she gets home too tired to talk or too depressed. She told me she loves me, but she's not ready for a relationship yet. I'd love to heal her and make her happy, regardless of being in a relationship with her or not. I just want her to be happy. That alone, would make things better.

I struggle with some kind of mental illness. I can't say what it is, since I've never been diagnosed. I believe, however that I have depression and/ or avpd.

Also, she lives in another country and I'm scared that if I meet her in person, things will change. Like, she will stop liking me. I'm very awkward in real life and can't express a fourth of what I write.

I'm scared of completely deliver my heart to her, although I do trust her. But, I just have a feeling that she may not want it, since she mentioned she's not ready for a relationship yet.

She's been with abusive exes and has a rough past, which is no wonder she is trying to protect herself.

So what should I do? We are both afraid, but we love each other. We are planning to eventually meet up one day. But that is what scares us. We are afraid of hurting each other and being hurt. Maybe because it may won't work out, not because we would actually hurt each other.

She's my everything. This is the first time I felt such strong feelings. I am numb on the inside, but when I am with her, all my demons fade away.

It frustrates me being so useless to her. I want to do something for her, but she's been to busy. We haven't spoken in more than a week. It will probably carry on till March or something.

I've been severely depressed. Talking to close friends helps a bit, but my closest friends are online friends. My real life friends are not that close and I don't feel comfortable with them.

The darkest thoughts have been running through my mind, and I've been idealizing suicide lately. The only thing that keeps me from doing it is that I have family who loves me, and I have online friends who are also family to me. If I ever did it, they would not know about it, I'd just become inactive forever, and that would certainly pain them more than my family since they would not know if I was dead or not.

Even so, I don't know how long I'll last. Don't mean to be pessimistic, but things aren't looking okay. I feel like my feelings don't make sense and that my thoughts are too confusing. It's becoming unbearable ",1

However, every day i feel more and more like laying in bed until an hour or so before he gets back, and that's when i get an energy rush and start cleaning up and cooking. All i feel anymore is anger, guilt and sadness, and i'm not sure how to go about it. 

The time difference makes it hard to speak to any current friends and making new ones feels like so much work right now. I have a lot of hobbies and i'm generally the person to prefer being at home, but nothing gets my interest, not even my favorite things. How do you find the motivation?",2

"Hello. To start I'll say that my depression has always been a peaks and troughs kind of mindset in which good and bad events flip the trigger. Since high school, however there's been a lingering perpetual sadness and loneliness.

I've never been the person that connects well with other people. I've had small groups of friends and a lot of times I have trouble finding a deeper feeling of a strong relationship with those people, like they are surface level. 

Then there was a girl...
I met her freshman year of college and quickly we were together and happy. Whenever I think of times where my sadness and anxiety was completely irrelevant to me, it was times with her. Our third year of college, though she went abroad and broke it off. She tells me how she felt codependent with me and needed her independence, but loves me. This was the first of multiple times this has happened, and I fell into a very dark place. 

She came back, though for senior year, and we quickly got back together, the way things were.

When we graduated she wanted to move to a new city she fell in love with when interning for a summer. I had opportunity in the city we were in, and so we went separate ways. We stayed in touch for a few months until, for the second time, I got a call with the same speech I got when she went abroad. I thought that was it and I would move on. Sad, but I needed to try. I dragged through my life bitter at the place I was living and the thin to non-existent relationships I had with people. I even dated someone a few months later, but I was never happy with her, yet I stuck with it and got broken up with again. There I was, hurt by someone I didn't care too much about but at the fact I was alone and can't find a relationship quite like before. 

Now to a few months ago. A friend of both me and my college ex catches up with her unexpectedly when she was in town for a few days. She tells them she thinks about me sometimes and what could have been...and that she'd be happy if I got in touch. I pounced on this opportunity. I didn't go into this expecting anything to come of it other than companionship, but as before, it fell back into how we always were together.

A month ago she calls me upset. There's another guy where she is living and is torn between me and him. She tells me to âclaim what is mineâ and if I moved closer to her she could promise me we could try again. I tell her how I feel and what comes out of it is a trip to see her for New Years. I go to see her and I have never felt less depressed in my life. Being with her made me want to actively try to live happier, healthier, and work harder. 

It's hard to leave to come home though and both of us are anxious about what will happen. The day came when we had to talk about it and basically I felt like I needed to make a big play. It was either going to work, or I would go down knowing I'd try. I told her how I felt when I was with her and that I was willing to move there and work everything out. I told her I loved her and it's what I want to take a chance for......all I received, was for the third time, was indecisiveness and doubt. She said she didn't know if she's willing up everything she built from scratch in her new City and doesn't want to fall in her old feeling of codependency. I felt defeated and lost.

I know this was a long post, and I appreciate anyone who made it this far. The conclusion is I have never felt more alone and isolated in both the lack of relationships I have and the place I live. I'm at a point where I don't know where I belong or the purpose I serve, and the girl I loved I wasn't good enough for, which feels like it transcends to everyone I put an effort into. I'm not sure if I'm looking guidance or just anyone to listen, but all in all, thanks for reading.

"A few months ago (possibly more, my perception of time isn't great right now) my best friend started having seizures, and a tumour was discovered in his brain.

The tumour has reduced massively in size, and the parts they were really concerned with appear to be gone. This is brilliant news! And while I feel a sense of relief, and am no longer fixated on ""what if it's terminal?"", I just can't seem to feel any positivity. I don't want this to have an impact on our relationship, but I feel like I'm withdrawing and slipping away from him. We used to live together, but he's back living with his parents (since before the tumour) due to other issues.

I don't think I'm emotionally broken. I just don't see a point in loving another person like I did before. why waist my time with that when I could make money instead?

"Why is it that we often hold on to something that we shouldn't. We were two women early 20's dated for 5 years. Our relationship faced many ups and downs as any relationship does. There were times that were easily defined as toxic. Then why do I still deeply miss her, she still remains as the first and last thought of every day. We don't speak, we don't associate through social media, all contact has been cut.

Little back story, like I said we were in a lesbian relationship together. She so badly wanted to get married and although I was unsure I knew essentially she was the person I would love to spend the rest of my life with. As we went through the process of getting a ring everything fell into place it had been 2 years without almost any fights. Finally the big day came, I proposed.
She said yes! Only to break up with me for âno reasonâ a week later. I was destroyed. She moved out nearly 3 months later and took her almost 5 months to admit she was sleeping with her male boss a week before I proposed.

I forgive her for these things that she must've been too ashamed to admit. She made me believe I was crazy when I noticed late night texts from her boss. Literally convinced me I had imagined seeing his name pop up on her phone, I suppose to cover up the fact she was doing something not very nice to the person she was supposed to marry. All and all thinking I was literally going crazy drove me to deep contemplation of suicide several times.

There's more details involved that are to say the least twisted and sick but I was so desperately trying to hold on to her that I didn't think twice of her late nights 6 days of the week or helping her shave private places when she said she was hanging with friends..

When she left she told me it was easy for her to leave me just as she left her family for me. She came from a loving family unfortunately they were Jehovahs Witnesses so they disassociated with her immediately after finding out she had been dating a âworldlyâ female. 

I know she's damaged psychologically, and in my heart I just want to pick her up and help her through her problems. She won't let me, and that's okay. But why do I miss her so? Why is she in my daily thoughts and nightly dreams? It's been a year and time will keep rolling, will I always miss this woman that wasn't healthy for me or herself?

Thanks if you actually read this and to all it's okay if you didn't, simply feel a tad better getting these deep thoughts off of my chest.

There are some things that I did in my past and I've never talked about it, I've been to counseling for a few years but I've never talked about my past because I can't, I don't want to say it out loud, I try so hard to forget it and it just pops in my head and it hurts. Please don't tell me to talk about it because it's not gonna make me feel better, it's just going to make me feel worse and I'm gonna hate myself even more. There are times where I'm smiling and laughing with my friends but when I'm by myself I start to get into my head and all these thoughts start coming in all these bad thoughts and I'm in this dark place and I don't like it. I'm just so tired of feeling like this. ",4
"In high school I was depressed. I cried myself to sleep every night and wished I would die over my meaningless woes. I am now 25 and 2017 was the happiest year of my life, but the past week I have been completely unmotivated. I do not want to die, but I have lost all desire to live. I search for joy and find fleeting moments. The love that is right in front of me feels like a far away flame. I watch the days pass me by and sleep seems to be the only thing I enjoy.",5
"I'm really bad at making friends, and worse at moving on when I mess up and lose one. My trust issues make it a lot harder to accept that certain people genuinely care for me.

A few months ago I had a really bad anxiety attack and said a lot of awful things to a friend who had been incredibly amazing and supportive. She no longer talks to me. After continued (useless) therapy and meds, sobering up, and staying away from the knife, I was unable to prove to her that I had gotten any better. And I haven't. I cut off all my friends without saying a word because I knew that I would rely on them and that there was a good chance of another bad attack, and because I felt unwanted, excluded, and hated. After several weeks, I tried to reconnect with some of them, but they definitely want nothing to do with me. I feel ashamed that I've let my depression get this far.

Even if they were to give me another chance, I'm not even sure how to be happy at this point. I know that I will unintentionally make them feel worse, manipulate, and push them away. I don't want to, but I become a really shitty person when I get close to people. In addition, I don't think I would feel any different. I think that I would still feel unwanted, even if that isn't how they feel or treat me. I don't know what to do. 

I don't want to be alone, but I also don't want to be a harmful presence to the people that I care about. And it seems that I piss them off no matter what I do, and I don't know if I actually am or not because I'm so broken at this point. Everything is so convoluted at this point that I don't even know if I'm being honest or hiding parts.

Not really sure what can be said. I'm just venting and hopefully letting someone else know that they aren't alone.",4
"I've been dealing with major depression and anxiety for some time now, I am using meds and seeing a psychiatrist but it does not help me a bit. I'm a son of a wealthy family and my family want me to continue the bussiness. My life is not a mess, I have a girlfriend who really loves me and I will break up with her in 10 hours. I'm not ugly, people usually say I'm good looking and charismatic. The reason I'm talking about this stuff is I see people who say they are ugly, their family do not like time etc. I'm not judging or underestimating them by any means, don't get me wrong. I'm just saying that I have a lot of things good in my life and I still do not want to live. I'm just so tired and sick of this life. The people. Everything. I realize sometimes that I'm really lucky in a lot of aspects in life, money, friends, love. But I still do not want to live this life.

"After I decided it's happening, I felt a calm close to euphoria. Went through my day, got everything ready, it was so calm in my mind, Wondering if anyone else did.",5
"I feel like I can't take this anymore, I'm trying so hard to calm myself down but I've been recently stationed in Japan away from my fiancÃ© and family and my fiancÃ© is slowly drifting away from me and I have no friends out here and I just feel like I've given up and have no point in continuing, I can't do this for a whole 2 years it's tearing me up already",4
"I've recently had a bad break up. I was dating a really great girl but she dumped me. We were really close friends after we broke up and even made out once after, but after that she kind of ghosted me on everything because she didnt want to get back together with me. Its been a while since then and I kinda lashed out at her, which pushed me out of her close friend circle and into some ambiguous territory where she can talk to me from time to time (Nowhere as frequent as before) about random shit, none of it personal and deep like it used to be. She doesnt trust me anymore. I know Im supposed to move on from my ex after Im dumped, especially if Im still in love with her, but I dont have any close friends and my ex was my best friend when we dated too. I tried to go on without her for a while when she ghosted me, but I was in the darkest place I had ever been in, I literally was so close to attempting, since then I've reached back out to her and I've reached a state where unlike before, I can live life, but I have a very strong urge I will never be happy because she will never be with me again. 

So we've been talking again for a day or two, a month ago, if she was active she would literally be texting me, she would tell me anything and everything, and that brought so much joy to my life. But now she'll talk to me about some random shit every few hours, seening my all the time like she doesnt really wanna let me in. But honestly, its better this way for my mental health than not talking to her at all. She often expresses how ""I still mean a lot to her"".

I know through some sources that shes started to click with some other guy like we used when we first started dating and Im honestly so close to a fucking mental break down. Just the idea of her moving on already is like a fucking dagger through the heart, but if I stop talking to this girl I lose myself entirely right now. I dont know what to do, one of my friends died last night and that has put me in an even worse place than before. I would usually talk to my ex about it but shes pointed out (and its true) that I had a phase where I would go to her and seek attention and support and shes tired of it. I know shes right because it was an extremely narcissistic phase and It was definitely my bad. Anyway, I dont really know what to do, I havent cried in a few days but I think I will today.",4
"I created this account to seek advice as I would prefer to protect the privacy of my wife and her brother - don't mind the vast emptiness of my post history. If this is the wrong place to post this or if someone knows a better sub, please let me know and I will remove / x-post as needed.

I have tried to assist my brother-in-law over the course of three years in a multitude of ways but I am not sure if there will ever be anything that can truly be ""done"" for him - thus I am reaching out to see if anyone has a different take on it all. Obviously there will be big chuncks of information that will be omitted due to space / time / privacy / etc reasons but I'll try to express everything the best I can. My background is homeless youth (troubled home, graduated high school late, etc) and then military service for nearly a decade, 37 yrs old now.

My brother-in-law (Let's call him BIL or BILL for short) was under the care of a psychaiastrist from the age of 12 to 28 yrs old (when the doctor retired). This psychiastrist medicated Bill with Adderall and clonazepam under the diagnosis of depression and ADHD. When Bill talks to me about this doctor he readily admits that he thinks the relationship had crossed the line between doctor-patient and that the doctor probably prescribed whatever Bill wanted.

From what I have been told from Bill's mom, dad and siblings, and Bill himself, Bill was a smart kid but wasn't someone who had any particular interest (no chess team, choir, sports, etc) and was pretty anti-social. Bill started drinking around age 16 as he felt him fit in.

Bill graduated from his very religious school and upbringing on time. He went into a custodial position right after HS and went to college for a portion of a year but dropped out. From that point forward, Bill lived with girlfriends and could hold a  job for about a fifth of a year up until I met the family. I emplyed Bill for about a year where I found that he was a hard worker but he required (I mean literally) constant supervision and instruction. Bill is not an idiot. I want to be clear about this. Bill is obviously an intelligent man who has a lot of potentional. With that said, he doesn't seem to have the ability to link the multiple steps from the beginning of a problem to the conclusion of the fix. Think about if I asked you to install a toilet - most of us, if we did not know what to do, would look up a video or read the instructions that were included. Bill would instead plan a large and very complicated process that would end up consuming an entire day without Bill being able to really explain what he did all day and why the toilet wasn't installed. However, if I explained the process up front or told Bill to look up a video, the task would get completed well and with quality. Bill has been pretty blunt in our conversations in that he says he has never paid a single dollar towards any rent in his life.

Bill expresses deep depression often, self-harms (and tells me that it's only for attention) and will actively sabotage any efforts to assist him. A good example is that he will discuss the desire to move into a support house so he can be around others going through this. He will make appointments, will ask me for a ride (where I will take time off work) and then on the day of the appointment, will reschedule the event (key point here that I didn't say ""cancel the event"") and proceed to get smashed drunk. I only find out after I have driven an hour and a half to pick him up that he is passed out drunk on his mom's sofa.

So that is Bill in a nutshell.

Bill's mother was, by my defination, an enabler to the extreme. She acted completely dumbfounded each and everytime Bill is drunk / quits a job / gets arrested / etc. She will take even the most obvious lies he spins as facts. I had been around for when Bill would tell her, slurring words and stumbling, that he isn't drunk and she would believe him, chalking it up to ""Bill must be tired"". This continued all the way up until earlier this year when she realized that if she kept cleaning up after him, he would kill himself (driving drunk, alcohol poisioning, self harm that went wrong). We have paid for Bill to go through five rehabs over the last 3 years and used state rehabs twice as we no longer have the funds for private help. Bill's girlfriend finally got tired of everything and booted him out. He moved in with his mother until recently when the local PD had arrested Bill six times in two weeks for PIs and trespassing. At that point we took him to a state rehab in Fort Worth, Tx to try yet again.

Bill finished the rehab about a month ago, got drunk and is now living homeless in the FTW area. He keeps in touch regulary (I cover his phone expenses, provided him with cold weather gear, shelter info, and visit him weekly). He has been hospitalized twice for alcohol poisoning over teh last month but still refuses to follow-up on the resources that are offered to him. I was tehre for both ER stays (both turned into 3-4 day in-patient stays) where the nurses and doctors offered him help but he never showed up to any of the follow-up visits. Bill's entire family ahs told him many, many times that we are all here for him.

I care about Bill but the most painful part of all this (for me) is I see how much of a toll this takes on my wife. She is a recovering addict (4 years sober!) and she has an intimate understanding of the pain and physical harm that can evolve from Bill's situation. I have spent many nights going to NAR-Anon groups trying to learn to be as supportative as I can for my wife but with Bill, I honestly have no idea what else I have to offer. My wife has remained sober as she makes that choice every single morning to be sober.

I guess after writing all this I have a fairly simple question for a very complicated situation - Can someone tell me stories about what has helped others / themselves in the past that might have seen any of this?

I know there are some folks out there that can't be helped. Others still can be helped but only they can start the process. If we can't help Bill, what can I say to the family to help (as much as is possible in this situation)?

Thanks for anyone's time who reads this and thanks even more for anyone who has even the slightest advice for us to help Bill.

"I thought that once I came back. That people would talk to me, that I'd be part of a group. That never happened so I feel so betrayed, like I put in so much work into myself over break to better myself and now you still won't talk to me. In reality, it was futile to begin with. Nobody would ever talk to me, I'm isolated beyond recovery. I'm destined to remain lonely.",5
"I feel nothing. I feel emotionless. My friends think that my depression is me trying to be edgy. What great friends, right? 

I can't write anymore. I can't draw anymore. I've opened up to my family about this but all I got was a pat on the back and a ""you'll be okay"". I feel like not even opening up to anyone anymore. How do people do this? I feel like I'm wasting my life. I'm trying to make my parents proud but they act like I'm not even here. 

What am I doing? Everything seems pointless. It feels like there's no hope for me anymore. I've given up on myself and so has the world. And I know what you're thinking, ""stop having a pity party. if you're so tired of feeling like this then do something about it"". And I have. I've tried every thing anyone has ever told me about getting past this or at least trying to cope with it. I'm a lost cause.

"It's been a few months since she broke up with me. She gave me hope when she left that she may be willing to try things again down the road. I've worked on myself and matured a lot since then. I really believe she would be happy with the changes. 

I recently reached out and she said she wasn't ready to see me yet. I still have some hope because it sounds like she could be ready to see me eventually. I'm going to give her more space. I'm willing to be patient because I love her so much. But that doesn't mean waiting is easy, especially since I don't have any certainty. I still miss her and think about her everyday. It hurts. I try to distract myself with a lot of different things, but my mind always comes back to her. 

I'm not really looking for advice. I just wanted to get things off my chest because things haven't been easy for me. ",4

"I am going to keep living

Tired of a lot of shit but fuck 'em, plenty of good in this world too.

The coach who expects me to just push harder and work through my Asthma won't. People who roast me won't. People who steal my shit won't. The bullshit standards and weight of people enforcing them won't. I went through some emotional shit before, I have fucked up before, but I won't act like this crap defines me or my worth as a human. This life is worth more than a grade, a social circle, my struggle to run with asthma. Not going to act like it's all better, stuff is hard sometimes, but this world is about finding your own way.

I don't do well with accountability for myself. Like when I work with a team or have to lead a team it gives me purpose. Without purpose it's just a matter of time when I fuck things up.

I have zero friends and literally no family to turn to in times of desperate need.

I have tried talking to doctors and therapists and that never worked either.

Whenever I bring up my problems, they say I am ""indulging in self pity"" or they treat me like I am blaming other people for my misery.

What am I supposed to do when my whole life has sucked and on top of that, my depression is getting worse?

It hurts whenever people try to take the situation and blame it on me, when they don't know me. Fuck them.

I don't know the point of this post. 
But, one thing I am certain about is that I am ready to die. I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know how to turn around my life. 

I don't know how to find love and I doubt anyone will love me (and if you are going to tell me it's too early to kill myself, then let me tell you that for most people, it comes naturally without any hard work whatsoever.

"Am I the only one who feels like when ever I try to talk about  my depression or just my brain in general to someone that they instantly start talking about themselves or just say that they have the same thing even when they don't? It might just be my family, or it might be me being a raging cunt but talking to people doesn't help me at all I don't want people to instantly relate to what I have to say unless they are being sincere, I want people to help me (does that qualify as using people?) it is relief when someone knows what your talking about. I'm really bad at explaining my feelings in the first place so it's really hard anyways, I just really hate talking to people in general if I could stop talking to people I would be fine just being me and the world.

"I was first diagnosed as depression then later, bipolar. But  I had this problem ever since I started to take the meds.

I try SO hard to maintain the so called âhappyâ mood. I just try so hard to keep my depressions down below the surface so I don't effect others around me.

But whenever someone ruins my mood, I get uncontrollably mad and I begin to yell at them things I would never say to them. I get strong urge to throw stuff or hit that person but I know that's wrong in the inside so I try to keep that under control. What I can't control is yelling and cursing. I just get so mad at the fact that they have ruined my mood, which I have been trying so hard to maintain.

Maybe I'm just tired of everything. Honestly I am sick of changing my meds to find the ârightâ one and the side effects are killing me. I am seriously lacking memories and verbal skills and that stresses me out greatly. I am sick of depression and I hate myself for not being who I am before I was diagnosed. What's wrong with me? Is this real me? I would never curse at someone or yell at them, but now look at me full of anger and madness.

I just want to end my life seriously. I don't want to hurt any more feelings of my loved ones and I hate myself for even thinking about hurting them when I was mad and uncontrollable. Does anyone else have this problem??",3

Now that I've finally done it I do not feel any less empty. I do not hate myself less. I still feel hatred towards myself and old doubts have been replaced with new ones. I do not get how I can go on if this is all that is going to happen. If I keep achieving things and I still have so many doubts that weigh me down or ones that leave me empty then what is the purpose of going on if you are always going to fail in some way. 

I used to also think that if I ever met anyone special that I would develop some confidence, but  if I didn't get any after this goal then how will a romantic relationship help me?

I'm scared that I will not find a meaning in my life, that I will never find worth in myself as a human being. Part of me really wants to just quit. Just stop it all so the feelings go away.

"I don't know where else I can go to talk about all of this, so here goes I guess. I'm a 19 year old male and I feel like my life is already over. My dad refuses to apologize for running out on us when I was 3 years old; my mother says he only picked me up twice from the time I was born until I could walk. 

My first memory is of my older sisters begging me to eat my dinner because the sun was setting and we didn't have any power, and I had to eat so we could go to bed when darkness came. I was 3 at the time, and they were 12 and 9 years old, respectively. My dad repeatedly cheated on my mom while she was deployed overseas and spent weeks at a Motel 6 across town, leaving us to fend for ourselves, and we would have starved had my oldest sister not called the school and gotten one of her teachers to come give us groceries to hide from him. We were afraid to call the police because he might come back and beat us or worse. We were just kids, I don't know what else we could have done and it's in the past now so who cares. 

The few times he did come back, he would take away the groceries we had and take all the money in my sister's piggy bank. 
Over the past decade my siblings and I have rolled through the years binging on drugs, buying from the internet and selling them to get my next high. My nephew was taken by CPS when my sister almost died from a week-long binge on meth. 

My stepfather is an idiot but means well, and he's about the best I could ask for in a time like this, but as much as I try, I can't fill the void my dad left. He tries to talk to me now, but refuses to apologize or even acknowledge the terrible things he did. I don't think I can ever forgive him, and I don't know what to do.
I don't want to go back to the drugs, but it would be so easy to run down to the supermarket and get a bottle of cough syrup for under 5 bucks to make me feel a little numb for a few hours. 

I tried to kill myself a month ago and spent 3 days in a psych ward which helped only in the way that I would do anything to get out of there, even lying about my mental state in order to get discharged as soon as possible. I've been prescriped antidepressants and xanax and i have a solid couple of best friends that I'm closer to than anyone in my family, but they're going back to college at the end of this winter break and I'll be stuck in my shitty hometown with no prospects for the future.
I worked as an EMT for a few months after getting my certification about a year ago, but I saw some shit that still haunts me every night.

I don't know what to do, where to turn, or who can help me. The suicide hotline tells me that they have to move on to another caller after 10 minutes of talking and I don't want to give them my address or they'll call the police like last time. I'm scared, and alone, and I don't know what to do.",5

"Hello all. This is my first post in this sub, and this actually is probably my first serious post on all of Reddit. I'm just here because I would like to get some things off my chest and I'm not in a situation where I can express my feelings to people around me in my life such as my mom and dad or friends. It's best to say these things to people I don't know but may also suffer from the same feelings or ideas.

I am severely and unhealthily depressed. I stress myself out over little things, I constantly put myself down, blame myself for things that I damn well know are not actually my fault, treat myself horribly and find different ways to make my life even worse daily. I don't like being this way, but I have tried so many different methods to change these kinds of behaviors and feelings but nothing I have done makes me change. I've tried antidepressants, ânatural alternativesâ to medicine, exercising my stress away, surrounding myself with positive thoughts and energy and people, but for some reason, every night when I return home and get in the bed, I lie awake thinking of how worthless and pointless my existence is. I am absolutely SHOWERED by thoughts of depression and worthlessness, despite knowing how many good friends and family I have, despite knowing how good my life has the potential to be. Every day feels almost like a struggle to me because I spend a good portion of the day out and about with friends or at work, or whatever I'm doing, but as soon as I get by myself somewhere, I almost immediately start to get those depressive thoughts again and again.

It almost seems like my brain refuses to let the rest of me be happy. I try to push away the bad thoughts and sadness but it just keeps coming back even stronger every time and I have gotten to the point where I don't know how to handle myself anymore. I have suicidal thoughts daily, although I would never act upon them because I know that suicide is not the only answer to my issues. But it's just an every day thought that I have, that I struggle with constantly. Always telling myself, âYou're a failure anyway, why not just do itâ or things like âYou know your family or anybody wouldn't ACTUALLY miss you, right?â It's just little things like those that add up ever so much throughout the days, weeks, and months that I struggle with. Sometimes I will have days that are absolutely fantastic like going to a concert or being in a show or whatever, and then as soon as I get home, I feel like garbage for whatever reason. No matter how many positive thoughts I try to think, the bad thoughts always find a way to become stronger and break through my positivity. And I'm just not sure what to do about it anymore.

Apologies for writing so much, but as I said before, these were things that I was keeping bottled up because I could not tell my family or friends about this because of reasons I'm not actually sure of. Fear that I will be judged, maybe fear of losing friendships, I don't know. Regardless, I thank you for reading this long ass post and hope that maybe someone has any stories or advice or whatever they would like to share.",4

My greatest solution has always been to just sleep but these days I can't even do it that easily. Second best was video games but no matter how happy I am for my character I will always come back to the fact that it's all virtual and real life isn't that beautiful. Music was also something that helped a lot but I have no mood to play or sing and listening to it makes me sadder most of the time.

It's an... oddly fascinating view I see when I look at myself outside this black bubble. I've dragged down those who are closest to me, because maybe they know, but I've never felt so grateful towards anyone for merely existing near me. 

I'm much more ready to get happy seeing something than I was, and maybe this was due to some desparation to get out of the vantablack-coated hellhole that I fell into, but slowly I started to look at life as string of vignettes, with a moment of quirky charm thrown in sporadically. I'm still far from escaping this pit, but were it not for moments like those, I'd have stopped this nonsense a long while ago. It's made me appreciate things that I've never cared about, even if moments where I truly smile are few and far in between.

Someone once read me this:

""Even the dimmest spots

Would now feel bright

For only in darkness

Do you best see light.""

Happy new year guys.",5
"I have no reason to feel this way. I am surrounded by loving family and caring friends but is there a reason for me just listening to slow music that appeals to me personally most nights and just feeling sad?

 I haven't really felt 100% for a couple years now, but no one i know has an inkling of what's happening to me, cause i think i hide it quite well with humour and when im socialising, it grants me temporary relief from these feelings of self doubt and loneliness, but always, when im alone these feelings creep back in and i can never seem to be rid of them. 

I've never really had much luck with relationships, i had something serious a couple months back, which actually stopped my lamenting, but it fizzled out pretty quickly and the feelings returned, and magnified with each failure to communicate with any girl im interested in.

And now i sit here by myself, again, watching the fireworks from my window as my family sleeps and with music in my ears, just feeling.. sad.

I don't really know how to explain it or why I'm like this, so i figured i may as well share and get outside opinions on it. Im not searching for a solution, just a means to understand this

P.s if anyone's actually interested the music i was listening to was the exis mixtape by roy woods and free 6lack by 6lack",4
"I'm at my girlfriends house, us and her parents are going to have a big dinner. 

But fuck me I'm so exhausted from this week and can't feel happiness whatsoever. They play the fucking music too loud, I just want to be alone and play video games so nobody annoys me on fucking New Years Eve. I hate this day, too much noise, too much fake bullshit. 

But of course nobody understands that one can feel exhausted from hanging with other people for a few days, so I'm the ungrateful asshole for wanting some alone time. 

Fuck my life",5

"Hi there. My name is Jonah I'm 17 and I struggle a bit with depression. Not as bad as it used to be but it comes and goes, especially in the winter. These are some things that happen to me when I have a bad day, and please, if you expierence the same or have anything to say about these, let me know: I usually want to eat salty foods. I don't get extra hungry, but I crave chips and popcorn. Stuff like that. I masterbate a lot more. I don't necessarily want to sleep more, but I like to lay in bed more. I get antisocial. I get the urge to start using again, although I know that if I do, it will only make things worse so I don't. I take comfort in smaller things. Usually stuff like videogames and youtube videos. Anyone have anything similar?",5
"I just wanted to say please don't give up. I know what it's like to be suicidal and struggle with mental illness, but hang in there because it can get better. There's resources out there.

After some life changing acid trips, exercise, yoga, therapy and meditation, I've found a way to fight through depression. I know you guys can too so don't give up.",0
"Possible triggers coming up.

I've built myself into a robust, hermit, cold, sociopathic character, but every once in a while who I would have been if my life went differently bursts through. I'm known for being extremely isolated in my family, and I have forced myself to be okay with being lonely, and it worked, it's my preferred state and I love it. But sometimes something goes off and I just realize I need people. I crave people. Therapists struggle to understand me(do you have any idea what an alienating feeling that is? This guy is supposed to fucking know, and he's looking at me like I'm a nut job), what about friends? What about a girlfriend? I failed high school, I'm alone, I have no skills nor do I want any, I don't believe in school in the first place, I don't believe in dedicating my life to some worthless fucking job, fuck that. I didn't ask to live and I'm not okay with the way I'm being forced to live. All this stress people talk about is stress that was created and it doesn't need to be there, and old fucks tell you 'when you grow up you'll understand' like I don't understand it, you're just accepting it, you're not okay with it, it doesn't make anymore sense, you just conformed and that's not okay, you're putting your ass in the air and you're just accepting that you're getting fucked, and you're okay with that because it's easy. I don't want to conform. I don't believe in this, I'm not built for this, I want to die. I am afraid, I'm alone, and I fear that I won't last any longer. I'm scared. I'm fucking frightened. I'm sick of people trying to push 'meaning' down your throat. Not a thing means anything and I will never not believe that. I don't give a fuck about what valuable skills you think I need to have. I want to live the way I want to live, and there's nothing wrong with that, and I'll never not feel like that and because of this I'm going to die, either soon and painfully. Or I'm gonna accept it and fucking kill myself, because I WILL NOT be able to cope with it for long. 

Edit: I feel obligated to just mention this. If you feel like dieing, get yourself help. If you feel without meaning, look into existential nihilism. Please don't kill yourself, and try to become happier. Get help. Good day.",5
"This is the first time I'm making the conscious effort to enjoy myself rather than wallow in my depression and self pity because nobody invited me to a NYE party. I've never before taken steps towards self care so that in itself is an accomplishment and I'm proud of it. Will I be back to my self destructive and self pitying ways soon? Who knows, but for just one day I'm going to allow myself to take care of me and if you've been looking for any encouragement or a sign to do the same then hopefully this is it. I've decided nobody gives a shit that you're laying in bed crying and the only person who can make me happy is myself if I just allow myself to enjoy things. Instead of purposely listening to that sad music when I'm already sad, I'm going to listen to my dumb 70's upbeat playlist.


Today is no different than any other day except for the fact that society deems it the start of a new year when in reality time is just a construct. The idea that you need to be around other people on NYE in order to have fun is also another construct. The sun will still set and rise like it does everyday.


If you give in to looking at social media you will see people getting drunk and what appears to be having fun. Realize that yes, some of these people are genuinely out having a good time, but a majority of it is making things appear better than they really are. They're not posting pictures of people sitting on a chair scrolling through their phones (which is what happens for 90% of the time at the majority of parties), they're posting pictures where everyone came together and posed like they're having fun and shit is wild and right after the camera shutter goes off they're back to scrolling on their phones. Some of them are probably feeling fed up and wishing it was over. Some of them probably feel just as alone as they do when there's nobody around (and that's truly a worse feeling). I know this was true back when I used to get invited to parties. You, on the other hand, are at home surrounded by things you can enjoy. Movies, TV, video games, books, hobbies like drawing, you name it. Would you really be happier at that party?


Anyway, I'm going to wrap this post up because, like I said, I have a day of fun shit to do by myself. If you're not ready to take the step towards self care, I get it. I've been depressed for a hell of a long time and never taken this step. But today I woke up and decided to do it. It'll happen for you eventually if it's not happening now. Happy NYE guys.



My plan as well as tips for tonight:


- Starting off eating a nice pot brownie that I've been saving (Also for the first time, I'm getting high because it's enjoyable, not as an escape)


- Watch a movie (Never seen The Wolf of Wall Street and I think I'm going to try it out tonight)


- Watch TV shows (I've been watching The Office lately)


- Play a video game (I've been into Battlefield 1 and Civ 6 lately)


- Depending on how high I get, watch Planet Earth (On a more serious note, shit puts things into perspective and reminds you how fucking cool the planet where we live is. People might suck sometimes, but nature is beautiful as fuck. The colors and scenery are amazing but I'll probably be high as shit crying when I see the predator killed the prey only to bring the food back to its own babies)


- Fireworks get to me pretty badly, so if they get loud I'm going to put headphones in


- Limit social media use (I know I won't be able to stop myself from checking, so I'll just remind myself of what I typed earlier when I do)


- Eat good food (Try making something new or order out your favorite food)


- Give my dog a hug and a treat at midnight


- Get a good rest and wake up tomorrow like I do everyday

I advise you to make a list like I did and if at any point you feel yourself drifting into self pity or whatever else, try to read it and do something on it to get you back on track to a good night :)",5
"Basically, I'm a girl who turned 18 in november. I've struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember (I started self harming when I was 12, but I managed to stop when I was around 15 or 16) and this year it's only gotten worse. My friends don't want to be around me anymore because they say I'm too miserable, or I'm ""always in a bad mood"". I suspect myself of having depression and I find it incredibly hard to get excited or happy about anything at all - I seem to have two modes of indifference or unhappiness. Recently (especially in the holiday season) my thoughts are consumed with how much I want to die, how much easier it would be and how little a lot of people would care. That, or many of my ""friends"" whom I thought the world of but I've since come to realise are only friends with me through circumstance, would suddenly care when they are nowhere to be found right now. At this point I have stopped trying to open up to my friends. I took a couple weeks off school last month in order to get my head straight and when asked why I hadn't been in, it very quickly became a competition of ""who has it worst"". I do have one friend who means the absolute world to me and I feel like I could tell him anything, but there's only so much you can burden one person with.
I've thought many times about how I could kill myself and I have written notes out for my closest friend and a few other people - at this point, it's just finding the courage to do it.",4

"I know we've all been through a lot this year. Some have experienced loss and others have been on the edge of their lives. 

I'm not going to be one of those people that gets super excited because its a new year because although its a new year tomorrow is still only Sunday. I've been reflecting all day unfortunately about the past year. The first half was pretty decent. I still had a wife and wasn't alone. Then the second half I lost it all. My wife, my car, my house and my family. I hate this so much. I've also lost a lot of friends that apparently can't handle someone who has depression which in my opinion is a stupid reason to not be someone's friend anymore.

My life's stock dropped a ton of points this year and I haven't been this depressed since my mom died 20 some years ago and I was abused. I miss the friends I had, but at the same time I guess they never really were my friend to begin with. 

Sadly, I feel like here at r/depression is the only place anymore where I can freely say how I feel without anyone else judging me. Without anyone else running away from me. If I posted this on social media people would just think I'm ""begging for attention"" when in reality this is simply how I feel. I hate knowing that I am always one to listen to what others are going though and able to sympathize, but that never seems to be a two-way street. It's as if I have some sort of disease and they stay away from me when I need them the most.

I also hate it when people say ""do it yourself"" ""build yourself up"" or my personal favorite ""you don't need anyone"" its so simple to say when you are the one that isn't depressed. I also hate it because I am a guy and other guys say ""you need to man up and stop being a bitch about this"" 

I wish I had an actual friend outside of here. I've resorted to Tinder and other ""dating"" apps but I suppose I'm not attractive enough either. 

Oh well. I'm just glad this year is over. Time to move on I suppose.",4

"i guess my parents had a mini intervention today where they asked me if i was depressed. i denied it, but if they can see it maybe im not as okay as i thought. i have a huge wall built around me, i dont tell anyone anything, how do i ask for help? im so frustrated and tired of feeling this way. ",5
"I have so many things that make me feel sad, especially right now, but I don't talk about them with others, even though I have some lovely friends, because I don't want to place the burden of myself upon them. Even though I have no evidence this will happen I am gripped by the fear that they will think I'm annoying (oversharing?) when I think about telling them this stuff, or I start to think about how maybe they will abandon me if they knew how sad I really was. I think that talking about stuff sometimes does make you feel better... just to unload that stuff. But I feel like I'm really making people suffer by telling them and so I end up suffering alone. What do I do??? I honestly need an appointment with my therapist today, but I have to wait till the 3rd and I feel like stuff could burst out of me before then that will alert people to my depression which I don't want. And all this is made worse by the fact that I'm not actually diagnosed. My therapist said it's not pathological what I have, but I feel completely alone in my thoughts and feelings all the time. If the act of me killing myself wouldn't affect people like my family and friends, especially my mom, I would have done it already.",3

"That's so embarrassing, humiliating and so frustrating especially on these last days of holidays. I mean, this person is with his/her loved one, people she cares about. Why do I even think about this person. It's infuriating and making this thread is giving her more attention than this one person deserve from me.",4
"So right now its 1 am on the first day of 2017 for me having been woken by some fools that actully celebrate such a thing with fireworks.
Now I could write such grand things here like:
- Every choice we make will in some way lead to pain.
- The human condition is a curse.
- If I have nothing to look forward to in the present or the future and there is no afterlife, what am I supposed to work towards?
but the bottom line is that I feel sad and angry about how I am currently living my life and I have no intention of changing it because I don't want to or as I would rather put it to make myself feel better:
- Because I see no reason to.
- Because nothing will change for the better even if I try.
- other stupid excuses like the ones above.
So here's to a new year of all our personal hells, the only wish I have left is that I won't have the chance to say that again.",5

"Grades. Looks. Achievements. Medals. Friends.

The inferiority complex. That second word ... the word carries so much weight

It's like an endless competition against the world. 

Every day, every minute, every breathe, it feels like a competition.

A gladiator match. A Hunger Games type of feel.

It's a big war on who has the biggest dick.

Every minute, I compare with others about everything.

How managed to get what they wanted at a much earlier age than I do. 
How they manage to get a hold of their own life but I ever did. 

How much I keep comparing grades *(which is my greatest weakness because I focus on it too much on a daily basis but I end getting bad grades anyway because my anxiety keeps killing me ... makes me procrastinate and black out and give up)*

Every day I am shaking the minute I wake up. 

Every day, I feel like I have this need, this compulsion, this must to be better than everyone else in every way ... but I am too weak. 




I am paralysed in that endless competition against others and everyone else in this world goddamned planet and at the same time, I lack the slighest motivation to even do the slightest change because I give up before I even do anything because I have an inferiority complex, one that I feel like I am an ant among giants or gods.

*(or when I did make a move to be better, I pushed so much that it took over my life. An obsession that became so invasive and destructive that instead of my mind verbally and psychologically abusing me in one way, I allowed it to abuse me in a different way. When I did want to make a change, I went too far and it became dysfunctional)*

In my head, I feel like I am at war. I feel like I am in an endless bloody nightmare against my own head. Sometimes, I even lay down my arms before it starts because I am too exhausted and fed up of fighting over and over and over and over again.

On the outside, I feel frozen. I am shaking every day. Even right now, I am shaking because I am constantly being reminded on how much of a pathetic, weak and ungrateful little bastard I am because no matter how much I try, no matter how much I wanted to push myself, I never am able to do it.

When I try to be better, I fuck up. I panic, I feel like giving up, I feel like I running through a battlezone where there are a thousand bombs exploding everywhere, terrified as hell. I feel little and weak and scared.

I feel like I am walking on a thin rope but I am shaking because I am scared. 

I feel like a thousand voices are screaming inside my head constantly all the time. They make me shake even more and because of that, I end up falling

Again. And again and again.

Sometimes, I even fall on purpose because I want to hurt myself because even though I have that compulsion to be better, I give up immediately.

It's like when there is a bully who is about to beat me, I beat myself instead just to save the time and energy and because I deserve it.

So I do that over and over and over again. From the minute I wake up. Every minute, I feel like I am in a battle between myself and my self hatred and more often than not, my self hatred wins.

So I beat myself. Over and over again.

And then I keep noticing how much I hate myself and because of that, I feel pathetic. I feel despicable.

And when I compare myself to others, that is the perfect fuel to add to the fire that is already burning me from the inside while I am tied up with my mouth shut.

I sit on my chair or stay on my bed, staring at the wall, or looking at the paper that I am supposed to write. I end up staring at it for hours, because I even lack that tiniest skills or the tiniest effort to push myself to even do it. But even if I did try, I know that I don't want to ""just try"", I want to go all out. 100%. ... No, 200%. 300%. I want to be the best. The best of the best. But I feel pathetic either way. So, I don't do much effort. 

So I get bad grades or fail .... another perfect fuel to the fire. 

My mind feels like it hit the gold mine. It has the perfect tools to make its bitch. It has me chained like an animal and it slaps and belittles every minute.

I look at others, I don't see people, I see numbers and qualities, those who have beaten me, those who I need to beat, those who I am already better than them and those who I absolutely can never beat.

All of them, my mind will still find ways to make its bitch even more.

**""He has got better hair than you do. His genes are better than yours. You cannot possibly be better than him""**

**""That girl will never lay eyes on you and accepts you as a friend or even a boyfriend. She has got eyes on that other hot piece of ass right there. I bet she is making out with him while you are too busy trying to control your anxiety""**

**""That competition who stole the girl you liked, he is probably much more of a man than you are in every way. I bet they just love to have wild sex together, making you feel like a wimp that you already are""**

**""Look at you. More Ds and Es. Of course you are gonna get those grades. You can bet your ass that you are gonna keep trying to get better grades but you already know that I am always there to stop you. No matter how much you try, I'll always find a way to beat you. And no matter how hard you try to focus during the exam, you can never focus because I am always there. No matter how hard you try, there is always a genius much, much better than you""**

____________________________________________________

Every day I go through this. Every day I have to put up to this. Every day I have to keep on going through this torture.

A world like this one, a world where everyone is constantly competing against each other, whether it is people competing for more likes on social media, or competing who has the higher grades or more income, or who has the better girlfriend and has the better sex, or has the happiest life, or who is more successful and able to beat his competition, or who is able to get the job he wants and the rest keep struggling and maybe even end up poor, a world where misery has become a means of humouring people like social media likes to poke fun of other people's flaws and failures, or the news likes to cause drama and panic when someone makes a mistake or something happens, no matter how big or small, or teachers and parents or people in charge, telling you what to be or not to be, how to dress, eat, drink and write, what to think or not to think, how you should be or not be. 

Plenty of people around, often looking for whatever faults and regrets and flaws you have, so that they could exploit it and take advantage of it and make you worse, 

Not to mention the internet, how much it is so full of trolls and cyber bullies who want to make you feel like you are the worst person on the planet, just because they can ....

 ... just the right kind of drug to give this bully, this abusive mind of mine that I was somehow chosen to have with me on a daily basis, the right kind of negativity and anxiety and torture to make me feel like I sold my soul to the devil and I deserve all that suffering.

That constant anxiety. That constant terror.

It is so much easier to just grab the rope and end it right there. 

Why would you choose to keep experiencing this day by day, night after night?

______________________________________________________________

Even right now, as I am typing this, I am reading and re-reading what I wrote, I am constantly shaking, I cannot think clearly and my mind is keeping a sharp eye on whatever spelling mistake or grammatical error or how much I sound like a person whose language are as poor as a mentally retarded person because his anxiety is so high everyday that he cannot think clearly at all, that mind is like a bully behind me, waiting to strike when I am at my most vulnerable. When I feel ashamed for a mistake that I made. When I am reminded about a past grade that I wished I could have done better. When I lost someone who cared about to someone else.

I often wish that I could grab a gun and shoot myself in the head. Maybe I will make that voice in my head shut up once and for all, but then again, it will still win anyway. Suicide is for cowards and pussies anyway ... and it calls me a coward and a pussy everyday.

If I keep breathing air in this damned planet, it will find a way to make me suffer and win anyway in the end. If I just end it, it will win either way. 

It's like fate has already decided isn't it? It's as if fate has put a curse on me and I cannot do anything about it",1
"a few years ago my dog was feeling well ill...
i just remember that one night hearing that it had to be put down.
and ever since it happened i have been depressed...",4
"I met this guy 2 years ago with whom I became best friend (although honestly I probably fell in love with him). He got back with his ex last year and since then I've just been spiralling down. When we're together, he keeps texting with his bf, and we barely have interesting conversations (we used to always hang out together and talk about everything). He keeps saying that he's my best friend, and he keeps saying that I'm very special to him, but he doesn't really act that way. Their relationship is long-distance and when he's with his boyfriend he barely texts me.

I tried distancing myself, but he's scared he's gonna lose me so he doesn't give me a lot of space. I spent last January-March severely depressed and ended up seeing a therapist. I managed to get out of the darkness, but these days I've been faltering. Especially since he's with him now for NYE and I'm stuck with my parents and I don't expect myself having a good time...

Lately we haven't spoke much and I was getting him out of my mind, but he sent me a picture of a gift his boyfriend gave him yesterday and my heart has been turned around. I feel like there's a hole, and yet everything is very heavy... I'm getting the same feeling I had when I was depressed. I keep getting the feeling I should simply ""break up"" with him, just tell him to go away, but when I think about that I start choking up and my chest just gets heavier.

Sorry this post is sort of messy and all over the place, I just needed to vent... It's hard, very hard.

I've always thought that it was all nonsense, I don't believe in the whole 'dying person's prophecies' as my family calls it. But now that I'm in my early 20s, still plagued with depression, and having a mindset of not wanting to work... I'm starting to worry that I'm starting to turn out as the 'no good' person my grandpa said that I'll become.

I know fate is our own to carve, I don't want to get into the whole determinism VS free-will debate but I believe that we should all be responsible for our choices. And right now, although I'm still employed, I have seriously considered quitting several times, and what's my reason? I'm tired of work. Real tired of working.

My only consolation is that I'm thrifty and sensible. BUT, my dad spends a lot thanks to his illnesses, cigarettes, lottery and luxurious meals, EVEN THOUGH WE'RE POOR.

"So, here is my deal. Im successful. I am in great shape. I have a good life.

However, i have 0 self worth. 0 Self esteem. The worst. It's been this way for years.

**Backstory**
Severely abused as kid.  Then when i got out, I would over react to situations like a psycho. Extreme over the top protective responses to minor things.  I never hurt anyone, hit anyone, but was a hot emotional mess with how i handled things.  Learned to manage that with years of therapy.

Additionally, I would often find myself in relationships with women, who were horribly abusive and did some pretty shit things, further hurting my self esteem that i would allow my self to be treated like that.


So, i guess i feel since that I have allowed people to treat me as if i had 0 self worth for so long, that i feel like new great people wont possibly feel different. 

Additionally, I have alot of anxiety that alot of people may think I am crazy/emotionally unstable if tot hear of some of my situations in the past and i have stopped interacting with new people simply out of this fear.


i guess my difficulty, is that if i was overweight, I would feel like atleast i could put a plan into place where i could logically lose the weight and help me feel better.

"So this is what happened in the past 6 months:

1. Lost my car to a hit and run
2. Lost my job due to an illness that's out of my control
3. Had emergency surgery to remove appendix and ended up staying in the hospital 3 days due to complications
4. Instead of visiting me, girlfriend dumps me the day I leave the hospital

I just need to build up the courage of not caring about others and how this might effect them. This world can't hurt me anymore if I don't let it. 

This whole things is after 3 of the worst years of my life. I thought my girlfriend and I were going to make it and someday get married, but that was also a lie... 

This world is just not meant for me, and I can't wait I finally get the courage to check out permanently! 

Hopefully I can do it before 2017. Otherwise I've failed something else I said I'd do. 

I needed to put this out there so at lease I can go with a clear conscience. Thanks for listening, and good luck with your own battles.",4
"I am in the hospital. I suffer from several chronic illnesses and have spent the whole year here. Only 22 years old. I graduated from college a year ago and haven't done anything since. I was a model, a news anchor, a girlfriend, an aunt, a sister, daughter, friend, and now i'm none of those things (besides a sister &amp; aunt. but i never see them.) I'll be dead in 2017 due to my illnesses. I have decided to end my life tonight before midnight. I have a lot of drugs at my disposal-enough to kill a horse-and no one checking on me until morning. I'm doing it. My mind is made up. My depression from these illnesses is the deepest sense of hopelessness i've ever felt. I do not want to die, but living this life is unimaginable for any longer. I want to get married, work, work out, pursue my dreams, have kids, have pets, help others...but i can't. so what is the use in living as a vegetable? I cannot do it anymore. I just wanted to post this here because i have no one. Oh, and i'm ""social media famous"" because I'm pretty but no one knows how dead inside i am. I tried. I made it a year. But no longer ",3

"I've had depression for a while now and I've slightly lost contact with most friends. I decided to throw a party to get back in touch with them. I had a great time before the party. I had pre-drinks with a couple of mates and it was chill, I felt calm and like myself. I should mention that last month I was dumped and cheated on during a long distance relationship that last 7-Months so the girl I'm about to talk about is the first girl I've had feelings for since. Towards the party I wanted to talk to my crush who was invited. We've been friends for a couple of years and in the past month I've invited her to a movie and surprised her with coffee before Christmas. I've been warming up to asking her on a proper date but when the party started. I relapsed. I've been feeling great up to this point. I shut down, I was a shell the whole night. She was surrounded by guys all the time and I didn't even get to say hello let alone have enough courage to. I was isolating myself for most of the night, even when it's my own party. Friend's comforted me and wanted to help but I just shut them out. The countdown to 2017 came and I left to my garage. I didn't want to see anyone. People left around 1:30am and I said goodbye acting really appreciative that they came. I'm happy they came but not during the night, I just wanted to be alone. The next day I apologize for not talking and just let out my feelings for her. She just thanked me for the night and ignored what I said about her. Now my day is ruined because I overthink. 

tldr; Had a party, relapsed back into my old state and didn't talk to my crush. I talked to said crush and she doesn't necessarily care how I feel.",4

"Why is the best advice always to confront them and have your heart be broken and move on, or you are still young, you will find the right person. If you truly fallen in love someone, not just by their physical appearance, it definitely is not something you can simply move on. I have known this girl for 8 years and i am so deeply in love with her, but i know she would never love me back. I consider her my closet friend but i know she does not. I know if i disappear she would not care. We talk almost everyday, play video games, and from time to time hang out as a group, but i know these things mean nothing to her other than a social outlet. The amount of things i have done for her, be there for her when her pet of 13 years passed away, be there when no one else would, go out of my way to help her studies, travel overseas after having a surgery just because she told me she wanted someone to hang out with, all those things i know meant nothing to her. I know that if someone doesn't love you, no matter what you do they won't, I am not spiteful about her not loving me back, i know she owes me nothing but it just hurts so much. She is the first person in my life that when she felt sad, i would feel sad as well, when she is happy, i would be happy. She is by no means amazing looking, but every time i look at her, i would see the most beautiful girl i have seen in my life. I can just spend the whole day looking at her, i can't even imagine loving any other girl other than her. I know she has some personal flaws, but no matter how annoying they are, i still love her the same. The thought of new years have made this experience even worse than it is. No matter how i try to play out a scenario of me confessing to her just to get rejected a move on, it would end in our friendship ending. I love her so much i rather suffer than not have her at all. How am i supposedly suppose to find someone else who is suppose to be right for me when no one can compare to how i feel about her. Sorry for the rant, whenever i am at a new low i hope posting here would make me feel better, at this point i just don't know anymore.",4

"Been doing really bad this year so far. Today I've had multiple anxiety attacks, breakdowns and panic attacks. This morning I spent about 3 hours straight crying, shaking and twitching. I'm going through some pretty heavy stuff atm. This morning I could hear quiet static. It sounded quiet but it seemed to completely mute any thoughts and I could barely move my arms to grab onto something. I couldn't think and I was just really confused. I keep hallucinating that someone I know is standing in the doorway and then my vision goes blurry my head hurts then everything returns to normal, I start crying again rinse and repeat.

"I used to have a great social life.  Everyday after school and over the weekends I would hang out with friends, I even had a ""girlfriend"", and when we weren't hanging out we would text.  It was one of the happiest times of my life.  It was great until the next school year.  Our whole friend group was separated into different classes and we all didn't hang out that much anymore outside of school. At the end of the year I found out that my 2 best friends were switching schools, one for personal reasons and one for sports reasons.  When I found out I was devastated and wanted to switch schools for next year also. I looked at the school one of my friends was going to and liked it, so I switched to that school.  Ever since then it seems my life is going downhill.  I have a few close friends but we rarely hang out or text.  I don't understand how they can handle not seeing their friends outside of school.  My best friend lives in another town, so we never hang out, and my other couple friends live in the country far away from the subdivision I live in.  In our classes there is also a huge gender divide, so chances are I will never have a girlfriend through high school.  I spend all the time not at school on Instagram and Snapchat looking at my old friends hanging out and having a good time while I'm feeling alone.  I feel like I'm missing out on what should be the best years of my life.  I don't think I'll ever experience going to parties, having a girlfriend, or doing other stuff teenagers are supposed to.

"Fair Warning: I need to talk and get stuff out there. I don't know what to do about any of this other than to keep walking, I am just losing the will to believe in positive things anymore, at least for me in my life.


I've had major depressive episodes since I was 15, with these culminating in a hospital stay at 17. Since then I have tried to live with my depressive tendencies and fight, just putting one foot in front of the other and using medicine to help even me out. This year, I've hit a wall I believe.

Starting in January, I noticed my marriage of 8 years was failing, but I stuffed it back in my mind because I didn't want to admit it. This continued until the end of May when I found out about infidelity and apathy on her part. Afterward, I lost most of my support network, with only my mother and father, one life-long friend, and one 1/2 life long friend remaining to help (I lost my extended family 6 or 7 years ago because of lawsuits arising from a death in the family). There is a lot of hurt on both sides, but at this point in time, I don't feel anger will fix anything. I would rather try to get thru this and let her find what she is looking for somewhere else.

I focused on my health to try to forget the pain and found out from my doctors that I will be lucky to live till 60 because of a complex back problem (kyphosis/stenosis/degenerative disc/degenerative bones/arthritis). I was already on pain meds for these conditions, and hoped for some type of surgery to lessen the pain; I was told I am too messed up to fix. I was also hoping to get off of Lyrica, which caused my weight to balloon to over 300 (I used to be 200-220),

I then focused on a skin condition I have and after a month long process, found out I have Hidradenitis Suppurativa, a condition that is rather depressing all by itself. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidradenitis_suppurativa). Because of its location (my neck), I have to treat it or it can turn into cancer, instantly spreading to my CNS and brain. I have had to start Humira, a drug that weakens your immune response in order to fight the H.S.

After going thru all of this, today I found out my wife canceled my insurance without telling me, possibly hurting my meds and causing problems with my treatments. I had to call her and tell her 1/2 of my medical situation; I don't want to burden her with things that may make her life harder, and have become rather private about my life normally (I feel here I can just talk without being judged, so I am talking about it all now). It was productive and she is going to try to add me back on (we are still married), but I am in store for a fight with the insurance company so I can continue my treatments. She also told me of some problems she has now, and even though I know that she helped create those problems for herself, I feel sad that she is having to go thru them.

I am starting to wonder why I even bother having a positive outlook anymore. I'm truly afraid I am going to die alone (as in single) and possibly before my parents (they are 70 this year). I feel like I have wasted my life, accomplishing nothing and bringing pain to all around me. I'm hoping for a better 2017, but I am not holding my breath.

Thank you for reading, I just needed to get this all out.",3
"I have lost around 8 friends over the past two years. They leave without even saying goodbye. It just makes me feel so worthless because I never tried to hurt them.

Exercise every day not too light or heavy

Meditation daily, different types

Vitamin D and perhaps some other supplements such as omega 3

"I'm a 20 year old guy. I won't rant how bad 2016 was or anything since I go through a bad phase every now and then. Ending the year I entered another one. And I know new year new me is BS but I'm really trying to get my shit together this year and be productive but some things always pull me down. Right now I've cut off every so called friend of mine who was close to me when I started '16 because I kind of hated how less people valued me and how much they used me. But for a start, I feel really good about cutting them off and moving forward even though that means I'm alone, I'm trying to use this time to start appreciating my life more and maybe meet new, less toxic, people. But with all the me time, I tend to think a lot. And most of the thoughts are negative. First off, I kind off hate my body and I can get really conscious about it around people and depressed when I think of it.  Starting from bottom, I am a bit knock kneed that makes my walk different, people keep telling me why I walk like that and the more they say the more conscious I get when I walk towards someone or a group. Having knock knees, I'm really uncomfortable when I wear any kinds of shorts or skinny pants since it's really visible then. After that, I have minor gynecomastia (puffy nipples) which makes my chest look less manly and fat. I can't even take off my shirt without getting uncomfortable af. Then I have a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa. I get lumps under my armpits and groin area . These can be painful and give a bad odour. The lumps can also drain pus and blood which can easily show up on my tshirts or undergarments. I have an overbite which makes my chin looks weak and the whole face unsymmetrical. I also have weird shaped fingers which actually don't hinder anything but people just notice and often make fun of 'em. Hell I cant even go bald if I want to because my head is not even round because how I slept as a baby. 
I have asthma as well and it just wont go away. I've to take my inhaler almost daily. 
Yes I've been hitting gym and people have been complimenting the muscles I have put on but all the problems that I have, they're not fixable (some of them can be fixed by surgery but they're costly) and it kinda depresses me thinking why out of all people, I have all of these things. I've never been happy of my body and I dont know how to cope with it and since I dont have many people to talk to I cant help but think about it over and over again facing the mirror or the other time I'm thinking why people do me dirty and why I can't have strong social bonds. Also the fact that I have achieved nothing in my life so far and have been mediocre at everything I have done doesn't help as well.
All this usually puts me in a bad mood and outweighs all the positive thoughts that I try to bring. I'm really hoping to get this year to be the best one for me but was hoping to get some help with how to deal with all this before I start.",3

"Hi, I'm extremely sorry if this isn't allowed but I have gone through depression all my life and this is honestly just a breaking point for me. I'm a 19 year old female going through a really hard 1 sided breakup. We were together for more than a year, I miss him more than you could ever imagine and my emotions are all over the place.. He stole around 300$ from me right before he left and has done so many horrible things but I can't help but love him. I made a few mistakes after he did and he said this was the reason. He wanted to have a friends with benefits relationship right afterwards.. I almost fell for it because I wanted him. I felt empty before and I just feel completely numb and empty now, I don't have 1 second of happiness anymore and I just don't want to live through it. The pain is so fucking BAD. I miss how he made me feel, physically and mentally. 

I take medication for depression, see a therapist, and have extreme social anxiety. He helped me so much and I have nothing to hold onto anymore. I'm seriously broken.

It's so much more than that but it's all so contradictory and wanting ti talk about it just makes me angry and sad as hell and I just want to fucking kill something. You have no idea how hard it was to stave off suicidal thoughts all day. I literally got out of bed at 6:30 so I didn't have to deal with it but I stayed up all night staring at my fucking ceiling. 



It's so much more but I just can't fucking explain it.



It's not even about Lin or anything anymore. It's just the slow climb of every day life realising there's nothing to it anymore. Ive experienced this so many times but each time it's like it'll never end and sometimes it just sticks with me for sometimes a year and sometimes a month then it goes away but it never really leaves. It's impossible to explain even a fraction at this point and I'm so sick of the only time I'm not numbing my brain is just a cacophony of screaming inside my head.



It feels like Everything is a cataclysmic disaster and I just want to get dragged into lava.



At the same time, who really cares anyways? It's meh. So I feel, **meh**. 



And there's no fucking reason, objective reason I should fucking feel this way. And its just a fucking Maelstrom of anger and rage and hatred that makes me want to claw my eyes out.



It's been years, I'm not gonna believe this it gets better shit. There's 7.2 billion people on this earth. Happiness and contentment isn't for everyone, what if 1 billion unfortunate fucks are just supposed to live in this miasma.



For years I've just had to accept this. I don't like talking about and i don't like being aware. I don't want to acknowledge this because I'm already aware it's there and knowing it's there is enough to make me want to claw and rip everything around me to shreds and I'm so fucking close I just want to smash and rip it all away and I'm so sick of this.


It's the ULTIMATE fucking paradox TO EVERYTHING. 


Life, love, people, goals. It's just white noise and it shouldn't be. And it tears me apart.



There's a handful of people that make me really feel alive and happy and even then. It's all just temporary



I sometimes think that I could just be over thinking. Most times it's not even over thinking it, it's I can't even begin to think about it. Where to start or how to. It's frustrating because it's sorta a shadow over who I think I am. Everything feels so entirely fake when I'm alone.

I can't imagine what it's like to have a family that loves you, or to be an important person to anyone else.

I'm so sick of being afraid of other people on and off all the time.

I'm a virgin because i'm so scared of girls. but when i am high i can actually speak to girls and make eye contact and just rest in myself, yesterday some girl sat right next to me on an almost empty bus, and when i wanted to go out she smiled to me, and another day i was having a fun time talking with a girl at my friends house(also high at the moment).

When i'm high i feel like i am my true self without a barrier trying to protect me from people.

Some days i am happy and i want to go out and meet people(not very often but sometimes) and other days i am literally scared of everything waiting outside my door

I am speaking with an psychologist at the moment, which is really good for me.

i am taking antidepressiv in a small dose, and i have daily suicide thoughts that i have spoking with my psychologist about.

I have so much anger inside which sometimes lead to me getting extremely angry because of small things.

"After many years of variety of meds for a variety of things (ADHD, depression, sleep, bipolar), I decided to self-medicate with coffee, melatonin, excercise, a therapy light, and running my own business rather than having to follow stupid rules.

Actually, the self-medication thing worked pretty well. It probably helps that I've lived with a physician for many years.

However, the business did not go well, and I'm back to being full-time employed for someone else. Basically, I'd need to make an appointment in St. Paul before work or after work, but I'd prefer weekends.

I have no motivation for anything, literally for anything. I should see a psychologist I guess but it costs money and it's a hassle to get to one so I postpone it.  
  
I dont see any point in anything anymore, I have no motivation. I find the few friends I have boring and cant bother with them anymore. I cut all the good ties I have because I dont find any joy from them so soon I'll be all alone, but I have felt that way for a while now already so there wont be a real difference.  
  
I see no point in bothering with anything anymore, nothing brings me joy anyway. The only one thing giving me happiness is the dream of a girlfriend, a relationship with love, but all I ever get is rejection, and Im probably not sending very good vibes so can I really blame them?  
  
Im not suicidal, I dont believe in God or afterlife so not living is a waste. But right now my life is just as much of a waste.  
  
I dont expect any answers here that Im not already aware of, I just felt I had to talk about this with someone, and right now *you* are the person I feel I can talk about this with.  
  
Needless to say, I need help. But I dont see how anything could help me really.  
  
I feel so pathetic right now.

"Never diagnosed but suspect depression. Making new year's resolutions and top of the list was the same one as last year: do something about my mental health... But then it struck me I'm not really that bad.

Basically, felt shitty off and on and have some good days (more bad than good) for the last year. I don't really care about most things any more, but I think I'm just lazy, and my sleep cycle is fucked up (however I feel like it always has been).

I'm know I should do something but I haven't got the energy and I'm too lazy. I keep telling myself I'm just a lazy shit but then why haven't I done something. When I'm distracted I'm usually fine?!

Like I'm not as bad as others, and half the online tests say I don't have a problem, so I feel like I'm constantly trying to justify to myself that I do have a problem, rather than living my life.

"Hello everyone,
I am sorry in advance if there is any rule that I should follow when posting this.
Where do I start?

CULTURALLY:
I currently live in Canada but I was born abroad. I have been here for the past eight years and to say the least, the country I am from is very stereotyped... It is located in North Africa so I let you figure out the stigma that surrounds it. I feel alone here. I tried my hardest to make friends but none of them stuck around. I tried to befriend people from different cultures and not just stick with my own (a thing a lot of immigrants do when they move abroad) but I feel like that backfired at me... I am not religious, so my own people do not like me and I am now seen as ""the wannabe white guy"". Other people (mainly natives) get to know me but they never want to do anything with me. Truth be told, I arrived here at 16 so all the groups were formed and all the friends were ""taken"". I try to be nice to people. I try to show them the good side of my culture by inviting them to do stuff and actually paying for them (don't think I am desperate, I do this occasionally when I get a good vibe from the person) but it never works. I do very well at school and according to my brother, people do not like me because they are jealous... I am not sure what to think of that.
I used to have interests but all those disillusions faded them one by one.

EMOTIONALLY:
I have a rather strong personality but no persona. I am the same with everyone regardless of who they are (except my family of course, who I draw limits with). People think I am too straightforward and too blunt. I just do not like to do things that I do not enjoy doing and my ""friends"" get frustrated and mad at me because I do not follow the rest of the people.

MOTIVATION:
I do well at school as I said previously, but my motivation dropped drastically lately. I do the bare minimum. Thank god (or the force) I was gifted with good brains that save my lazy piece of shit ass when needed. I feel like I could do a lot more, but my depression hinders every step that I try to take.

RELATIONSHIPS:
My ex-girlfriend cheated on me, yet I got back with her. She cheated on me with my so-called ""friend"". I got back with her because, on the spot, she apologized and I felt sorry for her because she, herself, underwent severe depression before I came along and saved her. I recently broke up with her because she did not keep any of her promises and also, she is constantly on the move and never really regained my trust ever since I found out she was playing me.

I feel like I hit rock-bottom. I am deeply, deeply, deeply sad.



**TLDR**; I feel like no one accepts me for who I am.



I am really down but I would really appreciate any constructive comments.

Thank you.",5
"Today I talked to my parents for the first time about my depression I have been dealing with. I was very apprehensive and nervous about how they would react. They were very understanding and sympathetic, and my dad told me it actually runs in our family. Going to see someone next week. 
It's a start and feels like I'm on track to getting better. Anyone out there who is too nervous to reach out for help, or too proud to do it, just do it! 
It helped me, hopefully others will give it a try.
Happy new year!",0
"I try so hard but it seems that the things I long for I may never achieve in this lifetime. It isn't money or status that my heart aches for; it's a strong sense of purpose. A group of individuals that I could surround myself with and call a âcommunityâ. It's a longing for companionship. I spend my days alone, and they are long and empty. I wish I was dead every day. I think about suicide every day. 

I have no one to talk to, because all my friends have slowly turned into acquaintances, and they no longer have room for my ânegative energyâ in their lives. I never asked to be negative. I try so hard to better myself, to get out of my comfort zone, to talk to new people, to exercise, to meditate. I will continue to try to better myself, even for the lack of a result I experience. I will continue to try because it's all I can do, other than commit suicide and I couldn't bring myself to hurt the few I do have that care for me.

I just wish I had someone that could understand and relate to me, and wasn't afraid of me or keep me at arm's distance. I feel as though I am a damaged person, with depression, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, and deep sadness. Because of this, people find it hard to be around me and to relate to me. It's a cycle that causes my pain to deepen.
These past few months have been difficult for me. I try to focus on the good, but it's really hard. I feel so alone and alienated. I wish I was dead. My boyfriend does not understand. He thinks depression is something more like sadness, like I will be okay if he can make me smile. He means well and is all that keeps me going some days. But unfortunately he lives an hour away, and we work conflicting schedules, so I only see him two days a week. Even so, I think so fondly of him, but I know that deep down he is not doing much to help my emptiness. I don't know if that's his responsibility or mine anyways.

I feel existentially lonely, knowing I will never fully experience another person, and they will never experience me. That I will live and die alone. I see people on facebook with friends, making music and art, touring the world, cooking and sleeping with a group of people that love them, and I just long for a life like that. I wish my life wasn't so empty. I have no one to turn to for my bad days, and no one but my boyfriend for the good days.",5
"Hello,
I was wondering if there are nations where you are given the chance to kill yourself in a assisted way, so I could release myself from this torment that I'm currently in.

I read about holland giving all depressed people a easy way out, and I was wondering if as a foreign person I could use their service. It doesn't matter if I've got to pay, I will pay all what I need to if I can get out.

Thanks a lot.",0
"I'm not really sure if this is the place to post this, but it shouldn't really matter as it truly upsets me anyways.

Honestly, I've got to be one of the unluckiest people ever. It's coming to be really stupid and upsetting how unlucky I am.

My dad always told me in order for you to be happy, you must be positive. You need to do good things for other people. You need to be a good person. So, I decided to change who I am. 

Over the course of the last three years I've donated to several charities, I've helped in food drives, and much more. When I went to Africa a few years ago, I gave away several supplies and food to less fortunate families living on the beach. Every year, on holidays, if I'm doing something such as getting my haircut, I'll give them a pretty generous tip. (~$20 tip on a $14 haircut)

I used to run a depression help and therapy sessions for people who wanted to end their lives. I've met amazing people and helped many people get past their biggest fears/ problems. Don't get me wrong or anything, I'm very thankful for those experiences and friends I've made.

But really, the last three years of my life have also been the worst time of my life. I lost my first true love. A five year LDR, and we'd finally met in the fourth year. But ya know, of course, she ended up cheating on me with her best guy friend, that I told her I was worried about losing her to. Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯ FML. 

I just started college this year, got very close to my roommates. Felt very fortunate for the new friends I had made. Halfway through the year, we realized that one of our roommates had been stealing our shatter (for dabbing. thc concentrate). Which has account for more than $300 total. He also stole my friends juul (an e-cig), he won't admit to it and of course wouldn't buy him a new one and/ or give it back. The other roommate is very stingy with money, so of course, the generous person I am, I bought him a new one. Mind you I already bought him new juul pods (juice refills) a week prior, because I felt like I wanted to contribute and help him pay for it, since I've used it a few times before. 

This winter break my roommate, the one who owned the juul, let me take it home with me. Of course, at the end of the trip, flying home, I stuck it in my front right pocket and somehow it ended up gone. I always check the seat pocket in front of me and my seat after flying. So, yeah, I'm going to buy him another one. 

Realistically, the money isn't that big of a deal. I mean, I am a college student and my bank account is going down, down, down. However, it's really starting to get to me with all this negative-luck. Honestly, in the past i've wanted to kill myself, and with my luck, I wouldn't doubt I'd accidentally kill myself. 

I don't know how to get this shit to stop, but it's really starting to get to me. I don't understand how I can be a pretty good person, and be so goddamn unlucky; while people like my sister, who are complete assholes, do nothing but strive.

"I'm young.So are my parents but I can't stop thinking that one day they'll be gone and so will my grandma whom I'm very close with. It brings me tears to me eyes every single day and night. I know death is a natural part of life but for some reason it tears me apart

I have depression so that doesn't help. My doctor has me on meds but nothing seems to work 

I know for a fact ,obviously, that if I don't die before my parents or other family members do I'm going to be alive for the death of them. It's just a really scary thought

I know I'm lucky to stil lhavd my parents as some people lost one or both of them. I just don't know what I'm going to do without them.  Even as am adult I would be so distraught and lost in life without them. It's killing me 

It's something everyone goes through so I hate to feel so shitty about something that will happen regardless

I try to make the most of every second im with them but when I'm with them I can't help but thinking the same thing- they'll be gone one day. It feels impossible to think anything positive and it sucks. 

I don't know how to stop thinking so negative but I pray and wish every day that these negative thoughts would stop flooding my mind so I can actually enjoy time spent with them because they could be gone anytime and I'd regret feeling so sad around them

"I swore 2016 wouldn't be another 2015 and then it all fell apart. I got incredibly depressed around March and suffered a breakdown and dropped out of school. 

I haven't finished a semester of college since December 2013 even though I've enrolled in classes several times since. I had a couple opportunities to get a job but in my usual fashion I totally blew it (caught the flu when I was supposed to go in for an interview).

I'm 21 and am doing nothing with my life. I know I'm young but at this rate I'll just be living with my mom until I die. I don't know how to fix this. This is the worst.

My health has deteriorated as well. I've gained about 50 pounds and have a poor diet in general. I always feel like shit. I know the solution is to just stop eating so much but it's hard when food is the only thing that makes you feel good.",2

"(This is a comment I posted yesterday that kind of explains my life right now and I was hoping maybe if I post it here I can just talk to someone about it.)

I just want my life to feel worth living honestly. 

I'm embarrassed by my body so I'm trying to gain weight and move my 150lbs to 180lbs to gain a little bit REAL confidence so I dont have to fake it all the time. I've got a healthy diet and workout routine going, but until I'm at my desired weight I just feel weak and unattractive all the time.

I just graduated highschool early 2016 and have decided to not go to college. It was four years worth of time in making that choice and weighing my options, now I made the choice and am wondering if I chose wrong. My business is going no where and I am running low on the little funds I have left. I can see my parents empathy for the unemployed graduate is starting to run a little thin too.

On average I wake up depressed 5/7 days of the week and go to sleep every single night wondering where my life is going and how I can manage to reach my goals and dreams. Happiness comes and goes, but 9 times out of 10 I'm just putting on a show. Nothing I'm not familiar with though. That's what my whole fucking life has been. A damn show. Now I'm not saying I've had it bad. My family is kind and loving. And I grew up relatively middle class. What I am saying is that as soon as I started highschool my life became fake. I put on this character so people will think I'm okay when I'm really not. 

I lie to my family and tell them that everything is going fine and that ""Business is great! I'm not depressed at all! Wow yesterday was so much fun sitting at home all alone with no one to talk to and only my thoughts to remind me of how much of a failure I've been recently!"" I'm too damn proud to admit that I have no clue what I'm doing and the last thing I want them to do is worry. Not like it matters anyways. My dad can see my bank account slowly dropping day by day. I tell him I have funds in my paypal, but I'm not sure if he believes that anymore.

Everyone knows I'm failing at life right now too. Whenever someone asks about my job my parents and friends never say that I'm a photographer, or a video editor, or a writer, or a musician. It's always ""well he's just taking some time off right now."" Or ""yeah he's unemployed."" Or ""He doesn't really do anything."" Or worst of all ""Oh he's just having fun messing around with a little photography."" Really? Messing around? So practicing my craft for 6 years and now trying to run a business is just messing around. Well shit I guess they're right. It's not like I'm making any damn money doing this anyways. Today I officially shut it down. Everyone seems to think that all it is is a hobby so maybe that's how I should keep it. I just applied for a few shitty, monotonous 9-5s, the things I told myself I would never do and I feel like I sold out all my values. I've given up everything I stand for and I've given up on myself. I highly doubt I'll even get the jobs anyways. No one wants to hire someone with past experience as ""summer lifeguard"" and ""photographer"".

Stress eats away at my health constantly. If depression isnt causing me to oversleep and then not even feel restes than stress is keeping me awake. I'm eighteen fucking years old. Eighteen. You wanna know what my blood pressure was on the last time I checked? 141/90. I eat relatively healthy, and try to exercise daily and my blood pressure is 141/90.

And don't get me started on dating. Oh damn am I fucked up. Aside from the fact that I have these unrealistic standards for girls I can't even get in a relationship. I've been in four relationships in my life so far right? Girl #1 broke up with me (she ended up figuring out she was a lesbian so kudos to her and no hard feelings on this one). #2 three months, cheated. #3 seven months, cheated. Took her back, cheated again. #4 same shit as #3. I went to one highschool dance. My senior prom. The minute we walked in she said bye and walked off with some other dude to dance. Now I've got these trust issues and on top of that I only chase unhealthy relationships. I get so close to a relationship with someone good then just lose interest because now it's not a chase anymore. What the hell is wrong with me?!

I thought that I could prove people wrong. I thought that maybe they weren't right. Maybe I'm not some fucking loser with no talents. Maybe my dreams aren't stupid and unachievable. Maybe once I graduate, I can show everyone that doubted me that I actually can do it and prove to everyone that following your dreams is an option! Well maybe in reality, that's just something you tell the stupid little kid who thinks he can be whatever he wants so he'll just shut up and leave you alone. 

I'm tired of people lying to me and saying ""You can do it! Don't give up! Dreams do come true!"" I've been putting in the work and got shit. Countless days and nights of no sleep trying to find that next job or making that project perfect. Dreams are just that. Fucking dreams, and that's where they need to stay. The only reason people think they can do anything is because they see a select few people that happened to be at the right place at the right time for a payoff. It doesn't matter if you've worked your ass off or if you just started yesterday, because in the end, all that matters is if you were lucky enough to roll the dice on the time they decided to land in your favor.

Everyday I wake up, put on this 'mask' and make people think I'm happy so that maybe they can trick me into thinking I'm happy too. The problem is now, is that it's not working anymore.

To top it all off, I don't feel entitled or like I'm allowed to feel depressed. I'm not homeless, not raised in a bad situation, I'm white in America. I feel like if I tell anyone about this all I'm gonna get is a ""get over it"" kind of response.",2

"For the sake of brevity, I will not go into too many details here, but here are the basics.  Over the past few years, my mother's mental health has deteriorated drastically to the point of suicidal.  It is now at the lowest point and she has tried multiple times to commit suicide.  She had health insurance for when she had her double mastectomy early in 2016 but my father quit paying for it.  If she had health insurance, the doctor said she would have been put straight into inpatient care but instead she was urged to go to outpatient.  This is just not a possibility with her at this moment.  There is no way she is capable of going to get help herself and I do not know what else I can do.  I do not have much money as I am currently a college student.  I do not know exactly what are my options to try and get her some help and it has been difficult finding the right path to get her some help.  If anyone knows of a way to get some low cost options or even just a general direction for me to look, it would be much appreciated.  I am really struggling here because I can not give her the full time care she needs to get better.  Thank you for listening and have a Happy New Year.",4
"Hi guys,

Just needed to vent a little, and maybe ask for advice. I've been in my new job for a little over 5 months and over the last month or so my symptoms have worsened pretty severely. The job is technical fault/support in a call centre for a major tv and internet provider. Initially things were really good, having a routine was really helping and I was making mental improvements. Backstory, I graduated university this year with a graphic design degree and this job is supposed to be a stop gap to save up some money to move to a different city with better job prospects as there are literally 0 design jobs in my city. 

Essentially I'm sick of working crappy shift patterns, having no life outside of work due to travel times and being verbally bullied all day by customers calling up. Kinda came to a head a few days ago when a customer called me useless and told me I was doing a 'piss poor job' - among other swearing and insults - even though his issue wasn't actually anything to do with my role or even my company, really. I know I'm doing a decent job - my manager and stats both say so - but I keep replaying this conversation over and over in my head and I can't shake it. I'm royally fed up of being spoken to like shit over things I cannot control. I'm waking up and I'm nearly in tears before every shift. It feels like this may be the worst I've been in years.

Also, if I decide to leave this job I have to give a months notice, which means I have no idea how I'm supposed to look for something else if I'm unable to start for another month. 

I really have no idea what to do. Anyone got any tips for a situation like this? The company and people are great but the job role itself is severely affecting my mental health and I know I have to put that first but I don't know how to do that. ",5
"Today I was sulking around because I really wanted ramen but if course, since it's New Year's Day, nothing is open. I was already hangry, had made myself some chicken in the oven, but set the heat too low, so it came out frozen. I was fumed and was ready to cry because I was so hungry and just really wanted some ramen. And, because all we've been doing this weekend is going to parties, we didn't have food at home. 

My mom was really annoyed that I was sulking and she asked me why I was feeling the way I was feeling. I just told her that I felt I was a 5 year old that wasn't getting their favourite food for dinner and that I'll be fine after I finish being sad. And then she said ""well maybe if you stopped sulking so much you wouldn't have depression."" after that I told her to fuck off and that what she said was an insensitive thing to say to anyone who was depressed and that she was lucky I'm not suicidal. 

I'm trying to let go of this situation now. Trying to cheer myself up by watching some Graham Norton, which usually works, but now there's this huge tightness in my chest and I can't breathe properly.

My mom has always been, and for as long as she doesn't open her mind up a little bit, she will always be the most frustrating person to talk to about my depression. I'm so happy I'm seeing a therapist, because in all honesty, I have no one to talk to who will understand without being frustrated.",4

"I am 18, Korean. I have been suffering from depression for 4 years now. And things are just getting worse. Parent's are obsessed about my future uni and I can not give them what they want. No matter how hard I try, everything turns out wrong. I leave home at 7:40 AM and comeback home at 1:00 AM and during that time I study, study, and study. But my grades are not getting any better. I started dozing off everywhere, whenever since 2014 and it is not getting any better. I punched my thighs so hard during classes to keep myself awake and since then there are always bruises all over my thighs.

I think my depression started because I was lacking of affection. MY mother always wanted more and I couldn't give her what she wanted. She never encouraged me but scolded me because she thought I was not trying my best. She wanted me to be awake until 12:AM so I study like every other sons and daughters of my mother's friend but I couldn't. So I had to stand up and study in front of my mother. At school I took depression test (My middle school made me do that every year) and obviously my test's result said I have very low self esteem and I am suffering from depression. My mother found the paper and asked me about it and I could clearly see disgust in her eyes so I had to tell her I misread the questions.

I asked my friends for help at 2013 and my mother got so embarrassed about the fact I want to die so bad and I told others about that. And she screamed at me because I made her embarrassed. 

2014 I took depression test again and my teacher helped me a lot. He offered my mother to make me meet the counselor. My father disagreed, claiming everyone gets moody sometimes and I am acting like a baby. (But he never treated me like a baby nor child. I had to do everything by myself since my parents were busy taking care of my younger sister.) And my mother supported me for few months until my father told my mother it was a waste of money. I started to sleep a lot because I didn't wanted to anything and that's when I started to doze off.

My mother bought me liquid medicines that is good for my health (according to what she says) but I didn't want to drink them. So she grabbed my face and poured it into my mouth. She stopped doing that when I chocked on it and threw everything up.

I did cut myself few times and my mother was so embarrassed about my existence so I didn't have to go to church or big family meetings.

I also got bullied few times and my parents did not give a fuck. They claimed I was being to gloomy.

I don't have friends, I don't have any talent, my grades are getting lower, I hate myself so much and I don't even have courage to kill myself.

I am sick of my life.

"Long time lurker, first time poster. Finally got enough motivation to start posting just from the fact that it's a new year and there's no end in sight to this bullshit. Not just my own situation, but this whole planet is turning to shit real fast, too.

To explain the subject line of the post, being on the spectrum is the perfect way to fail in every area of life: socially, romantically, emotionally, financially. Academically could fit in too, but somehow I managed to do well in school, probably from all the excess time due to no social life and being under constant pressure from my parents.

Throw in some chronic health issues on top of that, and no fucking wonder I'm depressed.

There's a really old meme of the Titanic sinking with the caption ""Sometimes the only purpose of your life is to serve as a warning to others""

This situation is a front row seat to witness the pure insanity that is going on as the warning goes ignored. Thanks to the shitty global economy, and cultural shifts, people are delaying having kids later and later. Basically waiting until the last possible moment before infertility. It's well known there's a link between autism and the parent's age.

I am Jack's complete lack of surprise when a family member updates me last week on a couple that had a kid in their 40s and the kid is now a few years old and having... delayed milestones.

"I'm on a mobile and first time posting, long time lurker. 

So for that past two years I think I've been depressed, I've had to deal with a lot of losses. 
I thought and truly believed I was just 'tired' someone mentioned that I have zero motivation and zero interest in anything any more. 
I used to be the type that would rant and rave about the latest book, I couldn't tell you the last time I had an interest in a book. 

I work full time, come home and go to bed. I don't eat, I barley have a conversation with my family anymore and have 1 friend who I see once or twice a month. Other then that I lay in bed, in the dark and cry. 

I'm ready to get help, I don't want another year to pass me by, I want my old self back. 

Can anyone help with how I can speak to my doctor  to about this, how do I open up? I've never actually said these things out loud as I have no one to speak to 

Thank you in advance for any help I can get! ",5
"I've been on Christmas break for a few weeks and it's been absolutely wonderful. The fall semester was one of the worst experiences of my life, and I barely passed my four classes. This semester I'll be taking six just to catch up, and if I don't fail any of them I'll be shocked. Just the idea of being back there legitimately is less preferable than a quick and painless death. 

FUUUUUUCKK",2
I know I sound weak a d pathetic for this but my parents are splitting and I have no idea how to even cope with it. I am losing my hope and I don't know how even face a day. At the moment I think the only way out is to kill myself and I don't think anyone would care. There is really nothing left for me to enjoy maybe I deserve to suffer and kill myself...,4
"Well, I had a long winter break that I could have studied in but I didn't and now I have a course final exam in 2 days and I just can't make myself to study. 

I don't play video games anymore or watch movies or even read books like I used to. I just eat, sleep and listen to music.

I don't know what the hell to do. My parents doesn't care about me but will probably be disappointed if I have failed. I never failed but just passed with minimum grades. I only get myself to study before exams by 2-3 hours when I panicking like hell and keep hitting myself. Help please.",2
"Hi.
So, um... I'll just write shit down how it is in my head. I've had a lot of bad things happen to me and when I've sought help to deal with mental issues I've been told that in cases such as mine most people have either committed suicide, on heavy drugs or are in prison. I'll admit I've had my moments and I've done some crazy shit since I've been around 5 or 6 and I'm now 30. I am now on a heavy dose of antidepressants which I have realised does not stop you feeling depressed but helps you deal and manage it. It has definitely helped with my anxiety though. I've kind of thought that because I'm such an odd character and quite misunderstood that I would start finding ways to help myself and I've done this by excessively focusing on certain things. I've focussed on fitness and weight lifting I also enjoy gaming and streaming which has also helped with my anxiety. Don't get me wrong, there are days I wish I could clean the whole fucking house and not lay in bed wanting to destroy myself... they're are days where my mind and focus is a bit off and sometimes even way off but I can say these days it's a lot better than it used to be. It used to be waking up not knowing whether or not I was going to die or other people around were going to feel safe. Having been getting better with my anxiety I have now made new friends, talking does not bother me and I'm more relaxed I've even flirted with a girl which was nice. I do have another issue I would love to fix, I have a stutter which I've pretty much had forever. But you know what, I don't even care at all. Fuck it.
My advice to people in that state where they just want to die is, well think about this you're going to die eventually so may as well wait until it happens naturally or I guess unexpectedly. I know what you're saying, the pain of living is too much. I know. I've been through in order of age and events: hallucinations and hearing things along with nightmares from age 2 until about 11 then I was sexually abused, beaten by a drunk father almost weekly and I was bullied pretty much every day of my life until I finished school. My mother was abusive, her boyfriend was abusive, I lost my sister to mental illness she's not dead just lost. My son died (dog) I lost my job then my girlfriend of 9 years then my house then my mind my souls and my humanity. Getting everything back to stable was hard. I tried killing myself many times, well I planned it many times and I don't know how I never actually did it. My girlfriend at the time was also pushing me and provoking me knowing I was trying to kill myself. I can go into a lot more detail but it's a long story and there are many other shitty things I've gone through but you know what. Here I am! I'm alive and I've been through that and more so I feel that I win!! I conquered all that and I still smile, I laugh and I enjoy things. We're all bigger and better than the things that have hurt us, talk about things so that you can show it that it doesn't own you, that it doesn't hurt you and that it has no power! All the things you're afraid to do, do it! Unless it's kill yourself don't do that because you, each and everyone of you deserves to live no matter what you've done and what mistakes you've made! This is life and no one gets out alive so live it up and love! 

Peace out brother and sisters!!

"I have been quit for a month and a half. I'm still depressed every day, no job nothing to do, constantly thinking about suicide/homicide. Today my mate said to me ""You were so much happier and funner to be around when you were smoking weed"". I blame weed for all my troubles, losing my job and my ex, having no savings.. but i'm off it now and tried everything to be happy without it, going to the gym, eating properly.. and i'm still just a depressed wreck. Would it be stupid to start smoking again? THX",2
It's getting worse every day,0
"I don't know how much more I can take. I've been depressed for years, tried half a dozen kinds of medication, been in therapy for 6 months (tried multiple therapists) but it just doesn't work. Every time I think I'm making progress, I'm quickly reminded I'm wrong. 


I have no friends. Not real ones. I can't remember the last time one of them initiated contact with me, not on a normal friendship level. I'm everyone's sounding board. I listen to their problems, I offer sympathy and advice, and they go on their way. I have nobody to talk to about my problems because they've all go their own stuff. They wouldn't care anyway. I always have to make the effort and then get nothing back in return. My boyfriend says his friend like me, but that's only because I'm dating their friend. 


I know nobody 'deserves'  friends, but I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I try so hard. I put in so much effort to be there for everyone whenever they need. I try to be fun and engaging and talk to people about their interests even though they never show an interest in mine. For example, I won a pretty big prize related to my hobby last month. Everyone knew about it, nobody cared. If my friend won an award, even in something I don't care about, I'd at least be happy for them and congratulate them. But no, nobody even pretended to care. 


I keep thinking if only I was more attractive, people would like me more. Attractive people have friends, right? If only I was smarter. I know I'm smart, but maybe that's not enough? Am I not funny enough? I travel a lot but make a conscious effort not to be obnoxious or pretentious about it. I don't post 200 selfies from my trips or anything like that. My hobby is slightly unique, but still something anyone should be able to relate to. I'm up for anything, I'm adventurous, I always put on a happy face. I just don't understand why my friends keep rejecting me. Whenever I try to make plans someone comes up with an excuse to bail. 


I've tried making new friends. I moved to a completely new city a couple of years ago to try and start fresh, but the cycle continues. 


A few years ago I was supposed to be my best friend's bridesmaid in her wedding. She demoted me from bridesmaid without telling me (I had to find out through Facebook) and then I wasn't even invited to the wedding. And I still don't know why. I've thought about it so many times and I can't think of a single reason for that to happen. She's still 'friendly' with me, so no, there was no fight we had, not even a mild disagreement. Literally nothing I can think of that would have caused that. 


Then a few weeks ago an out of town friend guilted me into letting her crash at my place even though my apartment is way too small and it would be a massive inconvenience. It was super short notice but I felt bad for her so said yes. She never responded to my reply, never showed up, haven't heard from her since. 


I wish I was just being intentionally obtuse but I... Just don't know why I drive everyone away. I wish I knew what I was doing wrong so I could fix it. 


It doesn't help that my mother has replaced me with my nephew. I understand she's excited about being a new grandma (15 months) and I love my nephew so much, but literally every single photo of me has been removed from her house and replaced with my nephew and sister. Not an exaggeration, all of them, even my baby photos. 
Again, I don't know why. My mum and I have a good relationship, hell we're away on holidays together right now! 


I'm at the end of my rope. I don't know what more I can offer people. I don't need a best friend, I just want someone to like me. I'm very lucky to have my boyfriend, he's great, but it's unfair to place all my emotional needs on him. I just want a friend. But it's like I'm not meant to have one. 


I'm so unhappy and don't know what to do. I want to know what I'm doing wrong because I can't keep living like this. I'm on holidays so I should be happy but I can't stop crying in the bathroom. Maybe I'm just meant to be alone? But if that's the case, I'd rather be dead",5
"I don't really know where to start, because I literally do not understand myself, but I guess I just came here to see if anyone could make me feel a little better.

I have always been an anxious person, always one of those people who worries about the smallest things and blow it up in my head, and I have had bouts of depression but they seem to come and go. I think the problem lies in that I hid this well from my family having lived away for university for 4 years, and when I came home I felt so happy to be back with them, that they never saw me at my bad state.

I have been living at home since graduating, and all has been fine. But I feel I've completely fucked up christmas, having thrown a complete crazy on my family.

I arrived home from a trip to Slovenia with my boyfriend late on NYE - about 9:30pm. They'd waited for us to eat and mum had spent all night cooking. On the way home my phone broke, and for some reason it put me in a horrible mood - usually I'd relax about this but as soon as I came in the house my mum said to 'just chill out and leave it until tomorrow' and said 'it's because you treat these things badly' and for some reason it made me go CRAZY.

 I knew I hadn't treated the phone badly and for some reason i felt so angry that I wasn't allowed to be worried about it (because I worry about my family alot). But I completely overreacted, stormed upstairs crying and shouting about how much I care for them and how they don't care for me, and from then on the evening went MAD. They all ignored me which made me get worse, although from their perspective I probably looked a bitch so I get why, but it made me so mad so I started screaming and throwing things around (again, I have NO idea why I did this, I see RED when I get in these moods). My sister came up and tried to talk to me and said it 'wasn't worth crying over' which again made me mad and I was screaming and screaming about how they should care about my stuff too. She lost her shit then, slammed her door and went to bed. Then my Mum got really upset, packed a bag and went walking, saying she couldn't be around it (she has PTSD, and has struggled with it for ages). Dad followed her, they returned an hour or so later. When they returned, Dad came to speak to me, I confessed everything about my anxiety and bouts of depression and feeling sad sometimes, and that I was sorry. But then I heard my Mum and Sister whispering about me being annoying or something, and I saw red again. I stormed downstairs, started screaming and hitting myself in the head with scissors, and  screaming ""how come they don't give a fuck about me?"". Sister comes downstairs, grabs me by the scuff of my jumper, shouts ""if you don't fucking shut up I'll get you sectioned myself you're being pathetic"", slams me down on the sofa, so I slapped her in the face. I DO NOT hit anyone, never have, but I felt threatened by her and annoyed that she somehow just didn't feel at all supportive. But i get that it would have been a shock to her. She was pissed at me. Lots of crying on my part and we all went to bed. 

The morning came and everyone was so weird, although my Mum and Dad sat me down and said they would make me a doctors appointment. But I don't know if I need one? I have no idea why I reacted so badly, but 50% of the time I am completely happy. 50% of the time I worry like mad, constantly worrying about family dieing, or if they're happy, if my boyfriend is interested in someone else, if people like me, if I'm hated... alot.

But I have NEVER felt so bad now. I feel like I've destroyed the one thing I was certain on, my family. I feel like I've destroyed the happy, innocent view they had of me and I'm now seen as a crazy bitch. I feel like I ruined NYE and that was the last time we'll have together for a while, as my sister lives far away. I feel like I've just fucked up everything. I can't stop crying, I can't stop going over that night in my head, I'm not hungry, I feel hopeless, I feel like my family will never be the same.

And I know I am probably being irrational but I just feel so shit. I want everyone to be happy so badly and I feel I have hurt that, when they have other things to be worrying about and demanding jobs. Now they'll look back at NYE and hate me for it.

I know this is a really long story - sorry. But I feel completely alone and I want the tears to go away, because I feel very overwhelmed. I really wish I could go back to that night and act like a normal person, because if that was the case we'd all be sat around together watching a film and being happy, but we're not, and I miss that. It doesn't happen often anymore and I fucked it.

"Maybe this post belongs in r/anxiety; I'm not quite sure. I do know that lately I've had this feeling that, on several occasions, has made me quite literally sick to my stomach. It's very hard to describe.

See, I recently turned 18. I'm graduating high school a semester early with a fairly low GPA (2.7 weighted) despite my myriad veritable academic interests because I have this overwhelming boredom and this feeling that nothing is happening when I'm there. This nothingness has grown increasingly pervasive in my life.

I want to go to college but feel it is not in my best interest at the moment. I want to take a year off and work but am worried a year might turn into a lifetime of dead-end jobs and complacency. I want sometimes to pass my house in my Jeep and keep driving. But what would that solve?

I guess what I'm getting at is that I have no direction at the moment and nothing is calling me particularly loudly. I don't know where to go or what to do. I often find my eyes welling up and my fingers tapping my quivering leg with a sense of urgency, but alas I am still sitting. This yearning to do, to live, to experience coupled with my indistinct, unguided future, has birthed an uneasiness, a tension, that I haven't been able to relieve. 

Thank you for taking the time.

"I want to start by saying that I have a doctors appointment tomorrow to address my mental health. But I have so much going on in my head, and I feel a need to unload my feelings. 

TL/DR: Severe depression, feeling guilty towards my fiancÃ© for dragging him down with me. Don't know what to do :'(


I am having a really tough time. I have been depressed for many years. I have always been insecure about my body (am overweight), bullied at school, not many friends, but I have been OK for the most part with a caring family for support. But after a couple of years of infertility and after a miscarriage of twins four years ago I developed a more severe depression and anxiety. I have been on SSRIs since the diagnosis witch seem to lower the anxiety but had not done much for my depression.

Lately I have been dealing with intense stress at work coupled with a decision to start trying to get pregnant again. This seem to have put my feelings in overdrive. I have been experiencing extreme anxiety ""attacks"" with several hours of crying without being able to stop. 

I was recently asked to think about when I last felt happy. I know when it was, it was when I found out I was pregnant over four years ago. 
Since after the miscarriage I can't think of a single moment that I have felt truly happy. I can't even remember how that feels like. In know that no one can be happy all the time, that's not how life works. But even when stuff goes my way, like when I proposed to my boyfriend or when I got my doctoral degree, I've not been happy. Glad, yes, but not happy if that makes any sense. 

I feel empty, miserable, like a waste of space and resources. I feel like people are wasting time when they are with me. I feel guilty all the time for bringing people around me down with me, especially my fiancÃ©.   When he asks me how I feel, I most often lie and say I'm ok. And he knows that I'm lying since he knows me all to well. When i do tell him exactly how I feel, he becomes sad and helpless. He says that he wants me to be honest, but when I am he can't handle it. He tries to fix stuff, like giving me phone numbers to helplines, websites with information, etc, when all I need is a shoulder to cry on and someone to agree worth me that life sucks. And yes, I have told him that that is what I need, and he tries. But he feels so uncomfortable when I cry and just sits there miserable while I feel guilty. 

I really really love him and we have been together for almost 10 years, but I feel that I'm wasting his time by being with him. He says that he loves me and I believe him, but love isn't everything. What comfort is love when every day I make him feel miserable just because I can't feel happiness? I also have zero sex drive. He wants to have sex every day, but itv happens only about once a month. Kissing and touching makes me feel really uneasy, but I pretend to enjoy it. Mostly it's OK, but sometimes I feel violated afterwards. I haven't told him this, I can't do that to him. We have discussed going to couples/sex therapy but I really don't want to tell him the truth since I know how much he will be hurt by it. 

I really don't know what to do. My insurance doesn't cover a psychologist/psychiatrist only a counselor. I have been to therapy with that counselor several times before and she made me feel even worse and that my misery was my own fault since I was so negative. She was one of those just-people (""just"" get over it / if you ""just"" think positive things will change / ""just"" stop feeling depressed).

I don't really know what I want to achieve with this post. Just needed to vent a bit. I hope that my doctor has something that can help me tomorrow.

If anyone had read this far, thanks for ""listening"".

"I bought myself a late christmas gift(even though I didn't deserve it as I wasted another year). Doesn't really matter what it is - it was broken. I could just get a refound from the store, but I couldn't make a call, instead sit in my room and cryed like a bitch.

"Every time I find myself smiling, it's always at a daydream about what might have been.

"Hey, so I have had depression for as long as I can remember. (Honestly for more than 8 years, I'm only 20 so that's a while!). Anyway I think its better or at least subsided now.

"I have both depression and anxiety so it may be more of an anxiety thing, it's hard for me to tell.

I eventually pulled myself out of bed and onto the hill, but when I got there it was like I couldn't even ski anymore. I fell a lot and my legs were all wobbly. Yesterday I was doing moguls and was going as fast as I could no problem. Today I fell down on nearly flat terrain. Bent my ski pole.

I know school is important but I'm disencouraged to pursue it. I can't seem to do anything normal teens do like going out, clubbing or partying or even casual picnics. For as long as I have lived I've never really done something with friends.. At first, it was because of family problems I ended up hating wanting money or needing it so I created a lifestyle for myself in which I don't use money or ask my parents for it. My life has always been sitting behind a screen watching people enjoy life and thinking to myself that once I get a bit older the family problems would be gone and the coast would be clear but I was dead wrong.
Now I'm 18, a loser no lifer, worthless, socially unwanted and ugly and the reason I say ugly is because I truely consider myself ugly.. I reckon the last time I actually bought new clothes was in the summer like january 2016.. I have been thinking a lot and maybe this is my life and I should accept that.. I can't really see a way out of the situation I'm in because weither its now or in the future, I will have to be in situations where the same family problems still present themselves..

I met this girl over the new years, we were talking and talking, her friend said we looked like a cute couple and gave me signs that this girl likes me. I felt as happy as anyone could be, we started hanging out almost every day, I feel so happy seeing her, hugging her, when she looks and smiles at me I felt like this was the best thing that has ever happened to me. But this faded. After a week of hanging out I noticed that me didn't talk as much as we would, that she wasn't smiling at me anymore, I wish I could tell her my feelings for her. This was the girl I could spend the rest of my life with. I am a complete fucking loser, I want to ask her out but I can't, rejection is an every day fear of mine, I love this girl so much, and this feeling will never end.

I cannot cope with this feeling anymore, and I know I will never meet someone like this girl, at least not one that likes me. See you soon reddit!",4
"So back in 2015 I had this girlfriend, my first one, long story short we broke up and I got major depression, suicidal thoughts, self harm(cutting, snapping, punching) for about a year. Luckily by mid 2016 I managed to get out of it but after the holidays I found out after I left year 11 and went onto a new sixth form this girl, my ex, is now at the same sixth form/ college as me and this is completely screwing me up, she told all her friends about all the stupid shit I said to her that I would've preferred to keep private, which in turn means they are all judging me, apparently they are calling me names and I'm basically being bullied. 
Not only that but there are these people in my computing class who started out being my friends but slowly I think they are just starting to bully me too, there was this picture I uploaded 2 years ago to my Instagram of me in a onesie that they keep teasing me about, they even went so far as to print it off and put it in my pocket so as to piss my off when I find it. 
I really don't want to go back to college as I don't want to face all of this again, i really think it's going to break me and pull me back to cutting and sucical thoughts, even though the thoughts have already started again.

"I'm trying so fucking hard to be happy, to function like a normal human, I went from sitting in my room all day, every day for a year and a half, only having human contact when I come online to play League of Legends and sometimes I wouldn't even get that far, be able to leave my bed or get on my microphone to speak to people. 

But now I'm back in education, I socialise a lot, having people over, going to parties, going to the gym keeping my fitness up and working out, as well as trying to script or at least write down for all the ideas I have for film college, but none of it matters because I'm not happy, there isn't an hour that goes by that I don't think about suicide.

I'm doing fucking everything that everyone says I should do to be happy and it's not getting better, so what's the point of even trying, everyone knows I hate myself, yet I feel like nobody cares, I have lot's of friends and I guess an okay family support, I have enough money, I'm not socially awkward and I'm generally pretty smart, but I still can't be happy. 

I've went to doctors and therapists, there is nothing wrong in my brain and half the fucking therapists don't even seem to think there is something wrong with me, but there clearly is something fucking wrong with me and I think I'm just doomed forever to suffer in this world with no one being able to do anything about it or even care enough to actually help me all the times I need it which is nearly every day.

I usually take people's shit because I feel like I deserve everything bad that happens in my life. But last night I took a stand. I asked them if they could quiet down. They didn't quiet down so I got mad and frustrated. I usually do nothing and asking them to quiet down took a lot of energy from me so I called military police after that everyone left and I felt good. I felt like I actually stood up for my self for once. Next day I wake up and I tell my husband that I called the police on them. And he mad me feel like I shouldn't have done that. Am I wrong for calling the police on them? They do this every week. I've been in alaska for 6 months now and this is the first time I have every done somthing like this because I put up with people's shit. I just feel worse now because I thought I did the right thing but according to my husband I'm such a heartless person. Now I just feel awful agian. I think about just killing my self for the most littlest things. Like somthing like this. But then I think of my 4 year old son and what life he will have if I'm not there. And how selfish of me I would be to end my life. At the same time I think he would be better off. I just don't know how to cope with feeling like this everyday. Being an army wife and a mom to a 4 year old is just too much. What makes matters worse is I have no friends to vent about this. And I never ever post stuff on reddit. I'm just tired. So tired. ,5
"After sitting down and talking with a good friend about the past and the present, 2 years ago I tried to kill myself by jumping off a building, i lived. Seriously mangled my legs and right one still shows but i walk fairly normal and look normal but I legitmately tried to get a gun to just end it. 
I sat down and realized I can live on. Alone and sad and with regret, but live on.
Starting 2017 im going to get mental help and finally come to terms with my choices.

To those out their who suffer and are unable to put it together my heart goes out to you for every time we wake up and we go to bed
when we smile and when we cry. Our loved ones see the smiles and the laughter maybe even see us fall and always stay with us.

Stay strong this year and look forward.",0
"I'm not insinuating suicide here, in any way, though I have had the thought. 

I'm stuck with controlling parents. Not to mention they are completely in denial about this subject. I don't trust them with ANY problems I have, big or small. I have never even been able to walk up to them and say ""hey I'm feeling down"" without it turning into a massive sprawl for outside help I don't want. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't want their help. It's not that I don't care about them, I just like talking to my friends a lot more. 

However, with parents such as these, they're constantly not allowing me to have the friends I want, do what I want, or make my own mistakes. 

They're keeping me trapped in an endless cycle of stress and sadness. My grades have failed because I simply can't keep up with my severe depression. But they don't get that. To them, I'm ""not trying hard enough."" And can I go to someone to vent, who I actually know and trust? No. They're a bad influence, weed smoker, etc. 

Not that I have a friend to run to, anyways. I mean, the only two people I even talk to are based solely on my comedic factor and emotional support(by that I support them) and so to them it seems like nothing is wrong with me. 

I want to be in a relationship, I do, but even at the age of 16 I've never had a girlfriend(serious, at least) and all my recent attempts have been met with rejection and then failed friendship. 

So I just don't know where to go. I can't keep up with grades, have no one to talk to, have given up on family, love, fashion, hobbies, school. Where am I to even go?

Not to top the traumatic shit that has happened to me. I have never told anyone, even complete strangers what has happened to me, because I don't trust anyone. 

Depression has made me way too critical of people's ulterior motives, so trust for me is an issue. Those two friends I trust wouldn't listen to me if I had a problem anyway. 

Not to mention my parents keep trying to send me to therapists and the like, even though I can't tell them what I've done, for fear of getting shamed/disowned/arrested etc., and even though I've told them this they don't care. They're trying to shove help down my throat, but with good intention. 

So, all in all, my life is in shambles right now. I just don't know where to run. Maybe someone will read this whole thing and listen and relate, but I doubt it. 

Sorry if this is jumping around. I can't organize my thoughts properly right now. I'm sorry. ",4
I also like to put my blankets in the dryer sometimes before bed and pretend I'm not alone. ,5
"A good while ago back in college, there was a guy who joined our friends group. Me and him had a lot in common, and while a number of us found him to be annoying, I stuck up for the guy. I told him about my past - my first love was a long distance relationship and when i went to visit her, it turned out to be nothing more than a huge joke on her end and that gave me trust issues.

Time moves on, we end up becoming roommates with another mutual friend. Eventually, introduced into my life is this other girl.  She's a bit of a depressed wreck, and given my past, her being into me as much as she was, made me a bit hesitant to label the relationship.  We slept together a number of times, and eventually my friend found out, much to my dislike.  They got along a bit TOO well for my liking, to the point where i told him that if he ever slept with her, it would end our friendship.

A couple weeks ago, i saw her leave his room and our apartment ever so casually without making eye contact with me. Knowing immediately what was up, I questioned him about it.  I went into his room, saw the condom, and what really, REALLY hammered in the betrayal, the breach of trust wasn't anything they did.  It wasn't the fact that something was important to me that he knew about and selectively ignored. 

It was the lying.

He's been tossed out of the apartment since, but he is coming back once winter break is over. But in this process, i'm done.
Earlier, i was an apathetical cynical wreck who no one cared about, but now I can't bring myself to trust anyone, even the other roommate.  My friend was the more outgoing of us, so of course he has more friends, but I can't involve myself with any of them, much less anyone else because I can't...trust them.  In one fell swoop, it feels like he's taken everything from me. 

I don't care for my job anymore. It's means to an end, and that end is a pretty pathetic life. I'm at the point where i'm done with everything, because as far as i'm concerned, I don't see anything positive anymore. ",4
"So I guess I could start by saying I know people out there have it worse than me, and maybe constant suffering is really worse, but I can't stand going back and forth. Good days, awesome days, absolute shit days, mediocre days, ad nauseum. I'll even go from a decent day like today to shit. Really the back and forth has made me realize how shitty the shit really is. It gives me perspective. You could say that is true of the opposite, but all I can think is that the good is amazing, but temporary, always temporary. 

Seeing that distinction is driving me mad, and I don't believe I have anyone to go to about this. I've tried with several people, and I don't get anything. Always sinking back into that realization that the few people in my life have shown themselves to not give a shit is so, so depressing. My happy days are the days I live for myself and forget about my relationships with other people, but that's an impossible life to live permanently because we all have relationships whether we want them or not. 

If I were to contact all the people in my life and tell them I'm going to kill myself, they would be concerned, take the necessary steps to stop me from killing myself, then go back to their lives. This is sort of a tangent, but I'm starting to simply feel like a pawn in other people's lives. Now that I am a part of some people's emotional landscape that they want to keep intact, I can't go. Fuck that.

"Hey Folks,

I feel that I really need a place to vent. This past September I was accepted into a program I've always dreamed of being in which was a great win for me. Unfortunately, it turned out to be bitter sweet because my grandmother passed away after a long battle with cancer shortly after starting. It really tore me up because I had to move away in August and didn't ever call her before she passed. I guess always felt I had something higher up on the list before calling her and might have been scared to call her too so just avoided it. The next time I saw her in person she was on a ventilator and heavily sedated, a shadow of her former self. 

The next months I kept busy with school which kept me from dealing with this event properly. Things just got worse from there though as one of my aunts was found dead in her house (heart attack) and another underwent surgery and ended up in the ICU. I feel I buried myself in school, shutting myself out from my emotions and told myself I would work through everything when I got home for Christmas break. The first day home, however, my mom got a call saying that the aunt who had surgery took a drastic turn for the worse and was on her death bed. This takes me up to now. This aunt who meant the world to me died and I just have lost all energy to function and have shut down. I'm scared to go back to school with all of this stuff still unresolved and I just want to feel appropriately for all of these losses. I've had a few complete breakdowns this last week but the grief hangs over me still. 

I think this is a first step to dealing with these issues but I'd really appreciate anyone else's perspectives. 

Thank you",4
"Sometimes I get the feeling where I want to HAVE the strong urge to die. I'm such a failure and I get so much hate from those who are supposed to be close to me. I have no real friends, no one to ""lean"" on or speak to...",5
"I got all As and Bs this semester (and last year I passed with flying colors), I made it through Christmas, I haven't done anything dangerously reckless or intentionally hurt myself in years, but I still just constantly want to crawl into a hole and die. I have a constant knot in my throat that won't go away unless I'm drinking, high, or talking to one of the few people that I really trust, and I can't figure out any other way to get rid of it without taking drugs that make me feel like a husk of a human being. I hate this, I should be happy, I should be enjoying my winter break and not sitting in my bed at 3am complaining on the internet. I wish I had the confidence to ask the girl I've had a crush on for the past year out, or at least be self aware enough to be able to convince myself that she's just not interested. Fuck this. I hate feeling like shit all the time while my life is actually going alright and then feeling fine for months at a time even though everything is falling apart.

"I was scared and haven't told anybody but I did it. 50 mg of Sertaline down, lets see how I do before I take my next dose.

Day 2 Update: Wow, what an overwhelming amount of support and advice, thank you! I have just taken my second dose and bar a slightly upset stomach and dry mouth I haven't really noticed any of the side effects I was so afraid of. I feel so relieved to finally accept my depression as a physical illness.

Day 3 Update: My insomnia has gotten a bit worse but my mind feels kind of clear and alert (the alert bit is what's keeping me up). Happy so far and will keep going. 3rd dose taken.

Day 4 Update: Yesterday felt like my ""brain fog"" lifted so I tried to catch up at work. It resulted in a terrible night where everything made me anxious (more like paranoid) and with a clear mind I could comprehend it all more making me very down. Today I feel nauseous with no drive to do anything. I'm now wondering if the brain fog was some sort of coping mechanism. Other than that this has been my ""normal"" for a while so dose 4 is down.

Day 5: Down, anxious and not in the mood to do anything. Dose 5 taken.

Day 9: Not sure if anybody is still reading this but for time in a while I didn't feel sad yesterday. It was like it was still there but dampened down. I hope it stays, it's such a relief. Otherwise my insomnia is worse and I found I cared little about doing anything the last couple of days.

Day 14 - Final Update: These are definitely taking the edge off. I was thinking yesterday how badly I didn't want to go back to how I felt 2 weeks ago, that's a huge amount of progress. I've also realised there is no way these will work without therapy, so I've rebooked my cancelled appointments. Overall the tummy upset/nausea is gone, I feel more mentally alert, find it harder to sleep and have less physical energy. I also have moments where I don't care what I do then later care a lot. That's a bit odd but I feel better so I'm sticking with it for now.",3
"I'm an infrequent poster here on other accounts, none of my posts have ever gained much discussion or traction. That being said - I'm desperate, and lonely.

_____________________________


Hey, everyone. 


I understand that in the past year or so, I've been pretty distant and non-communicative in person and over the Internet. This is no fault of your own, and I'm not a smug elitist bastard - or, at least, I try to avoid being that. For a long time, I've been afflicted with depression and it's affected every area of my life. It might seem obvious to a few of you, but even then, it's so scary to admit it. I'm afraid no one is going to give a shit, or think that I'm looking for dramatic attention. Hell, it's just a bad idea to come forth, because no one wants to deal with that kind of additional stress. I've lost or damaged relationships in the past trying to get people to understand, but all I did was bring them down with me, drowning them in the details. 


It's not an excuse for me to be a shitty friend, though, and it's definitely not a good idea to let it manifest in cutting people out - people that have supported me, that I've had good times with. I don't expect your sympathy, trust, support, or understanding, even. I just want to be a better person for you all. 


I imagined how other people would imagine their own funeral. Maybe you want a dramatic crowd, maybe you want your intimate friends and family surrounding your casket. It scares me to think I might have zero people around to remember me as someone worthy of being called a friend, or worthy of sharing a bloodline and a name. It scares me to think that the only recollection someone might have of me is a two sentence tidbit, and not a pleasant one at that. So I'm sorry. I'll be better. Tell me if I'm not, and if you could so kindly give me advice to be a better person along the way, you have my gratitude. If you want to talk or message me, let's catch up. 


P.S. If you post some unfunny ""crippling depression"" meme in response, then I'll have zero remorse actually cutting you off.",5

"This post is a mess. I don't care about structuring; I just typed in the words as they came to me... sorry for the mess...

---

I've been thinking about this for a while... then again, I stay in bed or sleep through most of the days, so I have a lot of time to think.

I talked to one of my friends (an increasingly rare species) last night and it got me to think.

I can't help anyone. As much as they keep saying things like how kind I am to them (""dude... if you really just said that, then you're not paying attention"") how good I am at listening, how much I helped (with what?)... nobody comes to me anymore when things happen. Unless I ask first, but by that time the damage is already done or they are already out of it.

So this friend and I talked and we talked for hours. Things got emotional at some points and eventually I just said ""Thank you for trusting me, but please, for your own sake, don't... you may come to me for help one day, on a day when I'm sick of being alive, and I will hurt you. I will makes things worse for you.""
Did I just say that? Really? Damn you, Bluerain12ya, what the hell are you doing?!?!

It hurt me. I'm on the verge of crying as I'm typing this and I don't know anymore what I'm supposed to do. Why am I even here? Why am I alive?

My mum recently told me about her depression which I knew nothing about. I didn't know how to react...
My crush was hospitalised due to a failed suicide attempt and despite how much we talked and helped each other in the past, she went to that other friend I talked to last night. I didn't even have the chance to help her. People who know about my depression, my medication, my self harm stopped talking to me. Sure we talk when I meet them, or if I message first, but for them to come to me first?
Hell, they are probably right. I'd just let them down anyway...

The only person I do talk on a semi-daily basis is someone I've met on r/selfharmpics
I have my doubts if I should message her any more, or rather if she should come to me and trust me with her problems. Every time I say something positive, every time I try to help, I feel like the biggest damn hypocrite on the planet. But I'm mostly worried that, especially recently, I just put my worthlessness for her to deal with, my constant whining, and I end up hurting her more than the suffering she already has to deal with. But I promised her, that I will not leave, I won't push her away and I won't let her push me away. That I might keep my distance if she needs it, but I will always be close enough to reach me. But I'm terrified that I'm just making things worse!!!

And I tried. I though if I try to help others, maybe I can take my mind off of things, and if they feel better, than I feel better, too. But I can't. And nobody wants to come to me. Nobody should come to me, anyway, since now I realise that I'll just be worthless... I'll just end up hurting them even more.

I want to run away. I want to vanish. I want to die in peace...",4

"Hello everyone, first time in this subreddit, not really sure though if this is a right one to tell my problem, so excuse me if it isn't.
Don't really know where to start. Thought what I wanted to write and it flowed like water in my head but it is a little harder to organize it properly here, so I will try to explain my situation as best I can.

Long text ahead.

I am generally a closed person, 25yo male, I have a few friends and some of them are really good. I can't make friends easily nor hold proper a conversation when meeting a stranger. I ussually cut it off quickly, especially with a woman and it feels to me that I act like I am in a hurry and it usually feels I don't really care about what they have to tell me about themselves and act like that, whether it's a man or woman. I am not impolite or anything like that, i just can't keep the conversation flowing. Sometimes when I consiously want to talk with acquaintances or try to meet someone new, I just don't know what to say, usually in this case because I don't want to insult them somehow and I end up not saying anything or very few, resulting sometimes in akward silences.

I just started on a temporary work 3 months ago moved from my small hometown to a big city. It took me, I think a lot of time to start getting comfortable around my coworkers (as most times). All of them seem funny, good and open people that won't get offended by anything I would say, either to get to know them better or just to make some fun on our break. But they are not really the case on why I am writing this.

My problem mostly lies after my work on me socializing with other people. I generally enjoy sitting alone in my house, spending time in the copmuter mostly, or doing the daily chores and a little exercising. I used to live with my parents before getting the job and I hated being in the house with them (I want to mention here that I don't hate my parents at all, I love them and respect them very much). Spent my time closed in my room on my computer, or outside with the friends I have in my hometown. Which are all male by the way and the closest I have. The few rest that I have in the city that I work are mostly old friends from when I was young that we just kept in touch. Nothing more.

As I see other people in the streets with girlfriends or even being friends with them and I am kind jealous, not in that specific person I see, but on the general relationships that I whitness. I beat my head on how to find a solution on this, but whenever I am invited from some of the friends I have here, I am generally too bored to go out with them and prefer to stay alone. I mostly am bored to go out with them, because they are male friends as well, as I don't know any of their girl friends that hang with. Even if there would be girls in that company, I still propably wouldn't go because of the reasons I described earlier. I would be too bored to get to know them or just wouldn't know what to say, staying completelly passive. I feel kinda sad to myself when I get to take some long walks in the city where I see all these people socializing having relationships. But when I get in the silence if my home, 99% of the times that feeling just goes away

(Kinda TL;DR) I am in a situation where I am content that I stay alone in my house, where I have peace of mind and without having to act fake to talk with people. BUT I also want to find a girlfriend, to try to hang out with the friends that I have here and maybe meet some new, either through my friends or through work but I find it completelly boring/tiring to get in the process to do all that and I just prefer to stay home in the end.

Is this depression, am I just shy, or is it that I don't really like socializing?",5
Hi for most of a day I feel bad but now i feel just...kinda empty. I think I was happy for some time but then I realized that I feel kinda...feared about something? Like I don't know if I'm happy or sad. Something between but not normal feelings. I enjoy reading (I doing this when I started feel like this) have smile on my face but it feels kinda wrong. Is it emptyness?,0
"This is going to long guys..sorry. I've been a long time lurker and I've never posted. I've read all of your posts, shared tears and smiles with things that I identify with. It makes me feel both sad and happy to know I'm not alone. I've been depressed since I could remember. I used to be a happy and positive little girl until the first time I was bullied. Since, I've been bullied and made to feel like shit from so many people in my life. My low self-esteem began maybe when I was 6? I've been struggling with life since. I'm 25 and I haven't finished my degree. Why? Because I can't make myself do the work. I get motivated for the first month and say this year will be different and I fucking fall into depression again and I can't get out. I fear falling behind and when I do I fucking give up. I will get my degree this spring (finally). I've had to get academic withdrawals because of my depression. I feel like a failure while all the people I know are flourishing. My life needs to change.

I told my mom today that I want to make an appointment with a psychiatrist so I can get meds. I've depressed my entire life...and I've tried to deal with it but my life is shit and I know something needs to change. I called and made an appointment and I'm fucking scared. I don't want to talk to someone who will be internally judging my fucked up decisions and life. 

Then my mom has been acting bummed and I asked why. She said she doesn't understand. Her and my dad have given me all they could and it doesn't make sense why I'm sad. She's now sad and blaming herself. I've tried to tell them it's not their fault and they don't get it. I can't talk to them. 

I can't talk to my boyfriend. We've been together for seven years. We met in college and I was better with my depression and actually socialized. But the years carried on and he graduated and we've been long distance since. I lost my friends because they betrayed me or just found me so boring. My best friend stopped talking to me when I got a senator internship over her congressman one. She just stared at me when I told her and neither she or her family congratulated me. She stopped talking to me since then. That was three years ago. She was my last friend. Sine then, I don't hang out with anyone, except my boyfriend when he visits. We've been long distance for the last five years but after my best friend left me, I've been so alone. 

My boyfriend is the opposite of me. In college and after, he's that guy everyone loves. He can make friends with a freaking tree. He attracts people and he has many friends and is social. I'm the complete opposite. He has to beg to get me to come out with him and his friends, and if I do i always have to drink. It's the only way I can talk and not just sit their silent. He's seen me when I'm so depressed that I can't even get out of bed. The last year has been horrible for me. I've spent weeks just in bed... and I can tell he's getting tired of it. 

He keeps saying I bring up the past and the pain I've endured and I can't let things go. I want to I just don't know how. I don't trust people and I don't know how to carry on conversations anymore. I feel resentful he's so social and well liked. When I'm alone watching TV like any other fucking day, he's out and having fun. I want to but I can't. 

For New Years Eve, I saw he was with people (mostly girls) and I texted him saying ""are you spending new years with girls??"" He just said. ""not one, there are some here but I'm not with them."" I told him to ""well have fun."" He didn't call to say HNY or hasn't talked to me since. 

The past four days I had another depressive ""bender."" I just cried, slept, and stared at my ceiling. I couldn't even watch tv. I just go some motivation to do some shit. 

I'm hoping seeing the psychiatrist will help and I can get ADD and Anti-Depressants. Shit needs to change. 

I've just been writing down my thoughts. Sorrry this is so long. This is just 10% of what I wish I could say but I don't want to write a freaking 100 page essay.

"Maybe I am exagerating, maybe I complain too much? maybe I give up too soon? I dont know if I should feel bad feeling BAD for something not THAT BAD? when there are worse people in the world? I dont know, what I do know is that I am tired of this.

I am a master student (yea fuck me right?) I am studying a master in economics with an scolarship I won to Europe (lol right) I do not even know how I got this scolarship, my grades were not that good at the university where I struggled all the time for being the best, but never was. I worked for 2 and half years in a bank, I never EVER knew what to do, what what my work assingment was, and whenever I asked my supervisor for directions I ended up more confused and never dared to ask again the SAME GODAMN question because it is annoying I feell into this trap all the time. It was deppressing, my supervisor used to call me worried about my situation I was all the time the last one delivering work assingments, was changed of department becauase of my low productivity. etc

After that nightmare ended, I came here to Europe to study, a new begining, no it was not like that, I still have the same problems, and discovered MANY MORE, i am not organized, (nor do I know how to be organized) I do not know how to manage my time, I do not understand the more practical assignments such as econometrics, I do not know how to write a fucking paper, everybody does, everybody understands, I am socially arkward, I dissapear into the people talking, I am not handsome, I hate my body.

I want to end my life, I reallly want to end it all right here, but if it were not because of my parents, my 2 friends and my SO i would not be here. I am affraid of cause pain to them. But I cannot stand it, I hate being the shitty stupid good for nothing kid, during this master I have left classes, got bad grades, and as usual, the last in the class in terms of perfomance or reliability.

why? Why does it happen to me? I really struggle to be better at what I do (I must admit I do not like my career) but no results? I really struggle to understand concepts, theory, processes, but no avail. I do not get better, and it hurts, it hurts to try it one more time, I am affraid to be dissapointed of myself again, I am affraid of feeling that sensation of not being to do something. I dont want to feel like a failure anymore I just want to stop existing. 

TL DR: I want to kill myself but wont do it, I am not good at anything or anything and has never been. ",3
"I feel like like I'm always running away from something and, at the same time, striving and longing for something else I don't even know what. It is like a videogame where you are always facing the final boss or feel it coming right around the corner, while simultaneously gathering supplies and ammo. But you don't ever die and come back to life for a second chance in real life.",5
"I have a lot (self-diagnosed, albeit) signs that lead to the dreaded D word. Not sure if it's because of external influences, or some chemical imbalance. I only find relief in meditation and sleep. I'm afraid to read others posts from fear of empathizing and manifesting their feelings in my life and not getting a sincere gist of my own situation and feelings. Are there any tips someone could give to someone who seems manic and apathetic at the same time? Is there anyone I can talk to who may understand what it is I'm feeling? Are these feelings even real?

"First of all I just need to get this out of my body, you dont have to read it or reply.

To begin with this was really horrible month for me. 
Besides all my bad emotions I can still actually enjoy things, still do something. I met a girl, she is really interesting and cares about me, you know that goth girl into David Bowie and Oasis era, freeminded smart and everything. I kinda needed this, someone who would fullfill my desires and bring te burried passions from me. I WANT TO LIKE HER, but my mind keeps tellin me its not enough like i dont need it, all my mind cares about is pleassure, to feel god. This relationship kills me. She likes my hair, but I am losing one side which makes me totally depressed I can't even count things i avoided because of it, keep checking if another fall, keep looking at them. I am also really skinny and my pose sucks so hard i hope she doesnt care... She invited me like before Christmas to sleepover oh boy i was so glad even i wasnt thinking we could have together something, I mean its awesome to drink a bit and spent nigh with someone you like watch movies listen to music and stuffs. We got kinda drunk and she asked me to kiss her so i did, I didnt need to have sex with her even I kinda wanted to try it for first time but it was ok, i just took of her bra and we had great time.

Next day i was happiest human on earth, trust me, pure euphoria. but i started overthinking it which was a huge mistake I mean we was drunk. I met her today again to make it clear for my mind I think she again enjoyed time spend with me then we kissed and It actually felt again good kinda weird but good... anyway i was depressed, melanholic and tired from everything i wasnt able to enjoy it. She cares about me, she likes me but i dont really think I am able to.

Drugs. I smoke for 1,5 to compress somehow everything, i know its bad i hate myself for it. I tried to stop few times but i felt like it wasnt me, i didnt feel addicted i jsut felt dead inside. Ive been drinking sometimes with friends and hell its so good, i still think about being drunk because its so good feel and that scares the shiit out of me jesus i am afraid, really afraid. We used to in this cold make firecamp drink and chill and trust me, those were best days ive ever head, spent time with people i like people who likes me and know me.. i never felt more happy than this birthday (turned 17 this motnh) cause we enyojed it together.

I was never like most of people (not into way am different) I had not like favourite sport i did long time, i have not hobbies, interests... ive never felt blithely. All i do is listen to music and surf net. I feel like i know every good band and i am afraid i wont find another :( 
Ive got bad grades, my parents and grandparent hates me for that. I hate myself for that but with my status i cant do anything, trust me. My best friend is lazy and addicted to weed, other i dont like that much and they are also lazy, well im too but i wish i could enjoy myself more. do stuffs, see shits.
I wish i was able to work and make some money but im too psychicaly exhausted its impossible.

I feel ill, do i need a help? I cant describe how i feel, its horrible..i sometiems fantazire about killing myself, i wouldnt do it, but i FUCKIN WISH I KNEW how it feels to be dead. ANYTHING than this really.

Also my grandfather died who i never liked, all he cared about was my grades. My mom woke me up with this massage and i didnt feel a bit sad, I felt empathy for parents and grandma but nothing else... it destroys me i have to write this but my mind was thinking about stuffs he left so i could get it. That day we had after christmas lunch and all they were talking about was funeral and how I should learn and learn things to avoid bad stuffs. From that time my mind got seed that like when i grow older i wil jsut piss out of family and forget on everything.

i need to listen music loud, I am getting addicted to anything what would let me get out of every emotion.
feeling happy has whole new meaning, its awesome, but needed.",5
"I've never been diagnosed, I don't have the motivation to get up let alone see a doctor but ive been feeling like this for a while. However recently I've been eating drastically less and I don't really sleep much at all. Does anyone else experience these symptoms, what do you do?",0
"I am taking prozac and abilify for many years... I have noticed my memory is not as good as it used to be... The dietician told me the pills can cause memory loss.... So?

"So my mum was 17 and moved out of her parents house, she got married to the first guy she met. He went to prison 2 months later and she had nowhere to go except back home. Her parents told her she couldn't come back unless she got divorced and so she did. Then a friend of hers tells her they know someone who has a house that is empty and has power. So she decides to go squat there. Well apparently the guy who was staying there was in jail. he gets out and they start living together. They have sex and she gets pregnant with me. Around the same time she's seeing the type of person he really is. She's pregnant and he wants to get pitbulls and he is training them to be fighting dogs. He takes her cat and feeds it to the dogs to rile them up. He beats her a lot. He kills her pets. One day the dog poop on the floor and he beats her with the shower rod and makes her eat the dog poop. Luckily she doesn't loose me as she is about 7 months pregnant. One of his friends comes over and helps her leave and my father accuses her of cheating. She wasn't cheating, even though Casey was in love with her and thats why he helped her. Im about 10 months old and she steals a dog from a man who was abusing it. She goes to jail for like 2 days. When she gets home, my father hadn't even as so much as changed my diaper. He was passed out drunk. Fast forward to when I am 3. She finally leaves him after he points a crossbow at me. After that she gets married and my step dad is strict but im also spoiled. We had money and a farm and my mum is the perfect mum and houseswife. When I am 10 she has an affair with the neighbor and gets pregnant. Tells her husband and he says she needs to get an abortion or he is leaving. so she gets an abortion and he leaves anyway. They get divorced and she gives up the house and everything we have. The farm and all the animals and our pets and we move up north. Im home alone almost every night so i eat dinner at the neighbors and she's always either working or at the bar. dating several different men and never home. She meets a guy and I didnt like him from the start. he used to steal money from her. He actually had a girlfriend he lived with and was having a baby with and she didnt seem to care. while he was having sex with multiple women. he gave me the creeps though and when i told my mum she said i was being a brat because i was mad about the divorce. when i am 12 they have 2 kids together and we have no power in our house in the middle of winter. my brothers are a year old and a newborn at this time. I cannot shower because the water is too cold in the house. So I take showers at school trying to hurry before anyone gets there. the school counselor keeps giving me clothes and its embarrassing. I run away from home and get caught immediately. Get the shit beat out of me. My mum accuses me of having sex with someone i was friends with. at this point ive never even kissed a boy. she's calling me a slut and throws me into the doorway and i cut my nose on a loose nail she says i hurt myself on purpose. Then we end up moving again because she says im going to get her arrested. im 13 and i am getting bad grades at my new school. she beats me with a studded belt all over my body and shaves all my hair off. I tell the school counselor and they do nothing about it. That summer i find out i failed 7th grade. and the beats me with the handle side of a fly swatter. the next day she screams at me that someone is coming over and ""why the f*ck are you wearing short sleeves?"" And i get beat again. I run away that night. I get a ride from a random guy and ask him to take me to the sheriffs dept. he lets me stay the night since it is so late and the next day he takes me. I tell them and I go into foster care. My mum tells them i am lying and that I am mad because I can't go out and have sex. Which is absurd. I end up with a foster family, they are religious. They do not like my alternative/dark style and so after 3 months I am sent to a new home.  The new foster family is an old couple. they have 2 other teenage girls who are 4 years older than me. The one they considered a daughter and she had been living with them since she was like 6. She hated me. I dunno why. But she was always so mean to me and treated me like crap. Well the old lady didn't seem to like me either. So the girl I shared a room with was the only one I had to talk to. One day a cupcake is missing from the kitchen and I get blamed for it. But I did not eat it. I get screamed at and then I go to school. After school my social worker picks me up and says that Im going to a new home. Im at the new home with the same girl who i shared a room with. She's a bit of a sl*t and is always getting me in trouble. And my depression gets really bad. I start cutting myself. When I go to school one of my friends see's my arm and tells the teacher. I'm sent to a mental health facility and am there for a year and a half. one day my social worker says If I do not go back to my parents I have to stay at the facility until I am 18. So I go back to them. A few months pass and after my final meeting with my counselor my parents decide we are moving. when we move, they do not put me back in school. They tell me I am going to be homeschooled. So I now am officially not allowed to leave the house at all. a few months pass and we are homeless. so my mums husband buys a crappy camper and we live in an rv park. i have to sleep in a tent tho. during hurricane season. the tent doesnt do good for keeping me dry at night. so i just get used to it. This goes on for 10 months and one day my step dad tries to rape me. when i tell my mum she says its my fault because i am a sl*t. We move into a house. I try to run away again but i cant. a month passes and they are drunk. they come into my room and he takes my clothes off and she holds me down. then i start crying. they stop and go to bed. the next morning she says if i ever tell anyone she will kill me. When I am 17, she leaves him and says she will make things right with me. but then goes back to him 2 months later. When i am 18 I meet a guy and he helps me run away. I'm with him and he is obsessive and he takes my phone away and accuses me of cheating. I'm with him 24/7. the last straw was when he hit me. so i meet another guy on CL and leave. I fall in love with him and right before Christmas he leaves me. I go back to my mums because i have nowhere to go now and she tries to take my phone of which i pay for. She won't let me leave the house and makes me cancel dates. I have to run away again. I backpack for a few months and end up in the west. Then I meet a guy on Facebook who I share mutual friends with. We hit it off and I move back to the south and we have been together since. ",1
"It's 01:12am right now.

I haven't eaten in 2 days. I smoke two packs a day. The most sleep I've gotten in one night was 4 hours. I get stupid stoned every night. I don't care whether I lose my job after being unemployed for a year. I'm being pressured to live up to certain expectations. I sometimes drink a whole bottle on a week day just to see if that doesn't get me killed. I constantly imagine ways I could die from things i see on my way to work. I feel nothing yet I'm constantly terrified. I crave intimate contact but I always push those away that try and get close to me. I hate that it feels like people think I'm disgusting. Unattractive. No confidence. A burden. I saw a co-worker break down in tears today after hearing her father passed. I wished someone would cry like that for me.

Let me just say I have the job I've been wanting since i graduated in 2012. The people I work with are the best people I've worked with so far. I've made many friends the past 2 years. My artwork has started to become popular on social media. Financially I'm quite stable. I kissed the girl I've liked for a while on New Year's Eve.

Yet it seems there is no point to any of the good or the bad. Nothing matters. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing will save me.

It's time I did something about the pain, so that it's finally over. Whoever reads this, please don't bother to comment anything supportive or encouraging. Save your time on something more meaningful",5
"Hi all. A few months back I found I have anxiety and severe depression, still trying to find the right combo of meds and the right doctor. Anyway, I'm 21 and work with pastries, and just really need some new friends....",3
"My parents make me go to the dentist every 6 months. The thing is I don't have the commitment to myself to even take care of my teeth. I know they are going to tell me I will have cavities if I don't improve, and that I ought to floss and use mouthwash and brush twice a day, but I don't have the energy to do that. Now my parents are going to have to remind me to do all that and it will embarrass me that I need to be babied as a teenager. I also have braces, so brushing and all that is already hard when I'm not down, so it's impossible when I am. This stinks.",0

"I'm going to school in the small town, and I'll be stuck here for three years. There's always the stereotype that gay guys have a ton of sex but I haven't had sex in two years. I don't know if I can make it three more. I know there's a lot going against me in this small town but it still makes me feel ugly to have gone this long without sex.",0
"I was a loser's loser. I was 20 years old, never kissed a girl, weighed almost 270 pounds, got arrested twice, and almost flunked out of my major in school. 

The 2nd arrest was the last straw. I hit rock bottom and I was so embarrassed. In literally ONE SUMMER, I hit the gym every day, lost over 65 pounds and saw a therapist. When I got back to college, I got a 3.9 GPA the first semester back. I also figured out a way to be popular with the ladies, finally having a real sex life and I got a long-term girlfriend (today I've slept with about 15 women, a feat that previously seemed impossible). I was amazed by my hard work and success, I truly felt like I was on top of the world.

Unfortunately, the girl ended up ruining my life. She thoroughly mistreated me, and I took everything she threw at me because I was just so thankful for the attention. She got a job in a new city, and I decided to get a job there too so that we could begin our life together after college. Unfortunately, said girl went to Mexico on Spring Break and cheated on me before I ever even moved. But, I got a great job, and I decided to make a go of it.

Now, I'm almost 24 and since I made this move, the depression has been back with a vengeance. I can't shake this feeling of inadequacy because I let this girl walk all over me, and now because I moved for her, I still have to deal with this breakup even though it's about 1.5 years later. Something about the way I'm feeling comes out in my actions towards people. Everybody walks all over me, I feel so awkward in everything I do... I have not been effective at my job, which I'm sure comes from the lack of self-confidence.

The worst part is that I feel completely powerless, unlike how I felt before. Every day is such an uphill battle, trying to be normal and feel happy. I work so hard at my job, but I keep making mistakes that I should not be making. Therefore, I feel like I'm spinning my wheels, which hurts the confidence even more. What should I do..?",4
"I feel like I have no purpose, and thus, no reason to live. I believe what I am experiencing is an existential crisis. I am at the point in my life when I have to figure out what I want to do with my life, and have to figure out where I'm going to go to college. As I see all of my friends classmates discover what they want to do, I am left behind. I am jealous and angry at myself for not knowing what to do. The only things I enjoy doing are playing video games, watching movies, reading/watching manga/anime, and hanging out with friends. Nothing else feels satisfying. I feel as though I either was born in the wrong time period, or shouldn't have been born at all. Do any of you have advice or guidance on what I can do to figure out what to do? I would greatly appreciate help.",5
"Title. Just felt like punching shit while I was in the car on the way back, just wanted to lose control but I didn't. Felt like cutting, going back to the drugs I just got free from, felt like just going back to my old self, just wanna shut myself away. Why does this shit affect me so much. Guess it's just cause it should be easy yet I can't not fail at least once first. Same happened with my permit, I failed the first time and felt worse then than I do now. Guess it's the embarrassment, my family didn't think I would pass anyway, they said they did but I could tell. My friend told me it'd be fine cause it's **easy** so I'd do fine, so where does that leave me. Just makes me feel stupid. I can't retake it for like 3 fucking months either cause I'm going back to school soon. Hopefully this doesnt come up when I'm there, less I talk to people less chance it will happen right, that's just how it is with everything tho. It's fucking embarrassing cause everyone else has already been driving for like 4 years and I just started last year, lucky them, I didn't live here until last year. 
This just sounds more and more stupid the more I talk about it, which it is. But it's embarrassing and just fucking annoying, can't handle embarrassment and it doesnt seem to matter how old I get, I never will. Not like anyone really expected me to do any better, they'll always just see me as a kid.",4
"I've taken the first step to getting help, but it seems that nowhere is taking new patients right now. The psychiatrists that are accepting appointments are booking several months out.

Starting this process has been pretty nerve-wracking, and now it seems like I will never get help. This entire process seems impossible.

Does anyone have advice for how to book my first appointment? Should I just bite the bullet and wait until April/May to be seen by someone?",3
"Side story:
I am never been diagnosed. However, I always remembered back when I was a child that I had some happy moments, but really sad times too. Until I started school at the age of 6, I was always feeling sad and alone. I was bullied often. 
Three years ago, my mom tried to kill herself. She had undiagnosed depression and had been living with it for years. We got her help. We all blamed the depression on her mother that abused her as a child. She is now on antidepressants and is learning to cope with it. 

I'm now 30 years old. I moved to a middle eastern country for work. Been here for 3 years now. I am a huge mess. I have never felt so alone before. I don't have any will to do anything besides just work. I have no family here for support.  I do have 'friends', but they will not understand nor will they really bother to care.  I know that I need help, but in this country, I'm too scared to seek for help. I don't want to end up like my mom. I know I should be grateful for all I have and all the opportunity that life has given me. I should not be selfish, but I still feel dead inside. 
I wish I can move back home... but I will come back as a failure. I won't be able to get any respectable job. My parents would be disappointed in me. I don't want to tell them how I really feel because they will feel like it is their failure as parents that I am this way. They worry too much and I want them to believe that I am happy. 

What the hell am I even saying anymore? 

Point: I know I need help. I have no one to support me. I'm scared to admit to someone I know that I have a problem. I can't go home. I have to make this job a success. 

So i ask: What was the first step you took to get help?  
How did you overcome the fear of being stereotyped? 

Thank you...",4
"I've been depressed for more than a year now, I am a teenager and self-diagnosed but I'm absolutely sure what I've been going through is depression. I confessed to my mother I was depressed once and she felt really awful, asking what she did wrong and it made me feel terribly guilty... so when she asked if I needed to be on medication and get professional help, I lied and said no so she wouldn't feel bad. Anyways, I've been going through these periods where I feel really good. Most of the time I'm content and sometimes I even feel happy. It lasts for a little while, last time for almost a month, and then I start slipping again. It's like a cycle, I'll feel good, then I'm depressed again and then, it gets really bad to where I'm seriously contemplating suicide. I don't want to die, I really don't, even when I say I do... but in those moments, it's serious. I hope you understand what I'm saying, I'm also extremely self-conscious, I've read this over a hundred times. Anyways, currently, I feel good again and I know soon that I'll probably return once again to a depressed state but, I feel really optimistic. This makes no sense, I'm sorry.


WHAT I'M REALLY WONDERING IS: I'm not sure if I should be concerned or not. I want to ask a professional but, I can't tell my mom... so, I came here to ask if anyone knows what this could mean. And if you've experienced this too. Thank you. ",4

"I've been unhappy for a very long time. I am in high school and I'm currently on my winter break. I've hated school for the last 6 or so years. 

Even though I despise it, I generally do pretty well. In elementary school, I got 90's and stuff without much difficulty. But when I started high school, my marks were a lot lower and I realized I'm not smart like I thought I was. It took me until the last semester of grade 10 until I was satisfied with my grades. I got all 90s and I was pretty proud of myself. I even won an award for history. 

Now I'm in grade 11 and I'm getting 90s in every course except music. I actually am getting a 60% which was the lowest mark I have ever gotten in a course. I'm pretty devastated because I have been practising like crazy. My teacher is also pretty considerate and let me redo a few things which I continued to fuck up. If you are in music, you have to take band which I enjoy. But this year you have to take it twice a week. One of the days I have to stay at school until 7 pm and I always feel really sad after. I'm just not enjoying it anymore. I know I probably shouldn't take it next year, but it feels like such a waste since I've devoted so much time to playing my instrument. I just feel so shitty. The class average is a 91. I am pretty sure I'm getting the lowest mark in the class.

I enjoy getting high marks, but I am a horrible procrastinator and I always stay up to like 5 am working on assignments. I have no motivation until I absolutely need to get stuff done. I just feel horrible when I get low marks. Everyone at my school is uber competitive and I feel like garbage if I get anywhere below a 90. I hardly pay attention in class and I always save things until the last minute. It's like I enjoy making my life more difficult. School has gotten harder and the stress causes me to cry often.

I don't have a girlfriend, and I don't have very strong connections with any of my friends. I don't enjoy going places with people. And I feel uncomfortable talking to them outside of emails, texts, and Facebook messaging. One of my friends always makes jokes at my expense when we're around other people. I often make self-deprecating jokes, so I am normally okay with it. But he takes it a little too far sometimes. I'm not the best at controlling my emotions -- I smile and laugh at inappropriate times -- so when I try to tell him I don't enjoy it, he says that I'm lying.

A couple years ago I ended a friendship with an absolutely toxic person. I'm glad I ended it, but he was also one of the only people from my old school. I really felt betrayed by what he did to me, and it still kinda hurts. I don't have many friends.

Every single day is the same old bullshit. I just sit there at school waiting for it to be time for me to go home. And then I go home and do nothing until it's like midnight and I need to do my homework. I hate my routine, I wanted some sort of change. But then I got some change and I hate it so much.

A week before the winter break started I found out that my mom has breast cancer. I'm scared and sad. I'm trying to remain optimistic but it doesn't look good. I had to spend that last week in class while my mom got subsequent testing. It was awful to have to wait all day at school. The worst was when one of her meeting with an oncologist was on the same day I had band. I had to wait until 7 until I found out anything. That's when I found out that she would be going through chemotherapy and then eventually surgery.

I had a history test that week. I'm sure I didn't fail it, but I don't think I got higher than a 90. This sucks because history was my best course and I felt proud of myself for once. And now I feel guilty for worrying about something as petty as a test.

Now it's over a week into the break and I'm just wallowing in self-pity. I barely leave the bed. My passions are to read comics, watch movies, and I'm trying to write a screenplay. For the first few days of the break, I was mildly productive. But now I don't even do anything. I have so much to read but not enough energy to actually do it. I am wasting my break.

We found out that her cancer spread to her bones. They aren't going to have surgery anymore. She is going to go through months of chemo in hopes that they will just make the cancer controllable. Best case scenario, it's a lifetime condition that they just need to closely monitor. Luckily, the chemo that she is going through isn't as intense, so she is not incapacitated. She's still working and stuff. Her hair will still likely fall out in a week or 2. She has an MRI and a CT scan on Friday -- we'll know if it has spread to any organs. 

My sister is in town from university. I haven't really talked about it much with my sister or my dad. My dad seems like he is trying to ignore the whole thing. We're not the most talkative family.

I tried talking to a friend who doesn't go to my high school. He is extremely unhelpful. He barely reads the messages I send him. A week ago, I told him my mom was starting chemo the next day. And he immediately changed the subject to what he bought on Boxing Day. I get that it's awkward, but all I was looking for was a friend to talk to. I didn't message him again until today. I was also pissed that he didn't think of messaging me to ask how things were going with my mom. He was going through his own personal shit a few months ago, and I listened and tried to be a friend. I feel like this friendship is extremely one sided and I need to end it.

I love my sister, but she keeps on pressuring me to get my G1. I know I should, however, I just have no motivation whatsoever. And I feel like I would be an incompetent driver. I constantly fuck things up. I can barely get motivated to study for a test at school. I know driving isn't necessary at the moment, so I can't get motivated to study for it.

School is starting again on Monday. I'm going to have so much work to do because exams start at the end of January. I have so much work that I could be doing over the break, but I just keep putting it off. I have a group video or something due for history sometime after the break. My group wants to start filming Thursday or Friday. On Thursday, my mom has chemotherapy. And on Friday, my mom has more tests. Even if I do get a ride to someone's house, I'm going to be thinking of my mom all day. I don't want to be a jerk and screw over my group. But I really don't want to film those days. Also, I'm really not close to anyone in that group to tell them what's going on. It would be really uncomfortable telling them and I don't know what other day we could film. I also can't get motivated to do any work or research. 

I don't want school to start again. I hate it. It's so stressful and I'm so unhappy. I had so little motivation before I discovered my mom has cancer, and now I have even less. I know I'm going to have a shitty time.

I am starting to realize how screwed I am for university. I don't really have any accomplishments. I've done nothing significant. My only highlights are my grades, but they are not even that great and I don't know if I can keep them up. I want to be a screenwriter, yet I know that it is nearly impossible to be successful. I just know that I'm going to fail at it like everything else in my life.

I don't have anyone to talk to. I feel alone and scared. I'm not suicidal (there are too many movies and television shows to look forward to even think about that). I am not very charismatic. Or athletic. Or smart. I doubt anyone will even read this. I just felt like I had to write my thoughts down.",5
"I've gone up to a higher dosage of Abilify and I've been taken off my sleeping pills because I tried to kill myself with them. I'm on some antihistamine for night time anxiety and it works pretty well, but my days are still hell. I just wanna be sedated and not feel a thing. ",0
"granted they leave you incredibly exhausted after smiling and being cheerful the entire day but hey, at least your unhelpful family can get off of your business. To be honest i almost had a ""slip"" a couple of times but nothing more than that.

"This is a rant/vent so thanks in advance to anyone who actually reads any of this.

I'd say my depression has slowly been growing since I was 12 and first googled reasons to live. 26 now and I try to live away from my family in other states or countries, though I always end up being financially dependent on my parents and returning back for Christmas time.

This year was particularly shit, I failed my uni course and turned smoking weed 24/7. I was only really sober for the first 5mins of each day before I'd start pounding cones. So my parents bought me a one way cross state ticket home. My parents are great caring people, which makes me feel terrible for not liking them (not that I'd ever tell them that).

Everytime I come back here my suicidal ideations get stronger and stronger. I've started seeing a psychologist here once a week,  paid for by my parents, and tried going up to 30mg of lexapro a day which along with weed withdrawal, if that even is a thing,  caused me to freak out and spend the day on suicide watch in hospital. So back to my regular 20mg. My parents want to keep me here, I guess they think they can help me, but I hate this house and all the old memories, accumulated junk and thoughts it gives me.  And I hate myself for hating the privileged middle class upbringing I have had.

After failing and withdrawing from university my student government support was cut and I had drained all my money on weed.

So now I feel stuck here where it all began, with no financial means to leave and no one to blame but myself. I keep telling myself I should choose life, but the other side of me seems I have had enough experiences of this world and suicide looks like such a beautiful, peaceful and final release into nothingness.

Thanks for being here r/depression, I find solace in reading your experiences and knowing that other people out there have their own similar battles. I've been getting battered with positivity from my family telling me to ""get outside and have a nice day in the sun"" or ""pull myself up by my bootstraps and get on with it"" or ""if you get a job you won't have time to think about it""
Once again I understand that this is them only caring and trying to help and once again I hate myself for hating their help.

"My psychologist gave me a new med to try and it was amazing. I felt 90% percent back to my happy self when on just my other meds I'm about 50%. Colors seemed to be brighter and I found myself feeling happy most days. Best 6 weeks ever. 

When she gave it to me she told me to stop taking it if the new med messes with my stomach too much.

Well it did, to the point where any pressure on my stomach caused me pain and I would have to just lay down until the upset stomach subsided. I toughed it out for awhile because i felt so good but it just got to be too much so I stopped taking it about a week ago when it started making me vomit.

I only have until next Monday until I see her again but everything is just awful. I feel like I'm worse off then before I took it and I don't know how I'm going to make it. Time is just dragging and every day is just awful. I find myself snapping at people and I just wanna cry all the time. It feels like when I wasn't taking anything.

I haven't stopped taking my other meds just the new one.

I just need a hug ;(",3
"I'm a people-pleaser. I like to fix, serve and help them, anyway possible  
  
That's kind of how our relationship started. I saw a complex, interesting girl hidden underneath all the darkness surrounding her and decided to help. It was not romantic until a month into knowing each other when I realized that I have just opened up to an almost stranger in a manner I never did.  
  
So, I knew it would be difficult from Day 1. There were so many things wrong with her behavior and I would spent days, weeks, months explaining some things. Sometimes it helped, sometimes it didn't, I never gave up on caring for her. The amount of times I heard from others (her family, friends, herself) about her getting so much better, that it was visible and how they believed in me helping her with day-to-day life. It made me feel that none of my sacrifices are going to waste.  
  
However, she went back to school, last year and she started to revert back to her old ways. I didn't say much at the beginning, hoping it would pass shortly, but it only got worse. She would be disrespectful, mean and cynical towards everything. Cold and cruel. You could say I was almost waiting for my turn, but instead I decided to not be too critical for the moment.  
  
It got worse. To the point where I believed I was going crazy accusing her of any bad behavior. I started to believe her saying ""it's all in your head and your imaginary worlds"". I couldn't take it anymore, the amount of hurt combined with both my heart and mind being broken, it started to affect my work, my lifestyle, my want to live like I used to. I told her about everything, criticized her behavior and in the end all I got was a ""Go fuck yourself. If I'm so terrible, leave me"".  
  
I broke mentally at that moment. I didn't know whether i was going insane or not, I even suggested going to a therapist for both my, her and the relationship's sake and to get some help because clearly I was being overwhelmed, but in the end she said she didn't feel like fixing my problems and that she wants to end things. She grew cold, distant and apathetic in a matter of days and continued to be like that for a month until we broke up.  
  
The breaking up itself... she refused to meet me in person, even after I said it was disrespectful. Again, I was told to fuck off via text and told to finally think about this relationship (like wasn't thinking about it and improving it 24/7 since Day 1...). I told her everything that I thought she could work on with her behavior and said my good-byes. Her last words were ""you finally thought all of it through"".  
  
Not longer three days after the break-up I found from her, now ex, old friend that she started dating another guy and has been hooking up with him for two weeks.  
  
After a few days, she had the audacity to ask me how I was doing. My first question was quite simple ""was any of that real or did you just need someone to help you get back on your feet?"". Her answer crushed the goddamn soul out of me: ""Don't mind it. I already forgot. Just forget it. But take my advice: don't jump into a new relationship instantly, you will be only pouring your old problems over"".  
  
I didn't even bother answering, didn't want to get cruel towards her, I told her friend about this and she cut contact with her in a matter of days saying that she couldn't believe the hypocrisy and that two-faced, disrespectful behavior.  
  
You might be asking yourselves: what's the moral?  
  
I didn't give up on loving people, I still want to help them as much as I can, started volunteering a few days ago. I think the moral is: no matter how shitty life or others treat you, no matter who they are, don't lose love for life and people. I was close to falling back to hate, way too close, probably closer than I ever was my entire life. Never had I had my heart shattered that badly, my psyche that confused, but I also met people with same or worse sicknesses than her and they would never act the way she used to.  
  
I know it's a bit of a stupid story, but I just wanted to emphasize that there are people who genuinely love you for who you are, even when you might not be well or great, even when you are not too nice to others. There will be people along the way, good people, ones that will make you not feel alone ever again. Sorry for writing too much, I felt strongly about sharing.",4
"About a week ago my girlfriend made me promise to stop cutting myself because it made her feel like a bad girlfriend.

I have some interests that keep me busy such as i like to write, i post in r/nosleep quite often but not many stories make it to the popular page and when they do they get taken down. I really don't want to let my girlfriend down in fear of her leaving me as she is all i have left, my friends dont talk to me anymore and my family barely notices me. Any tips on how to stop cutting and maybe become a happy person and be a functioning member of society?",5

The last seven years have been rough.

I've been in and out of depression most of my life, without realizing it because I thought that was what normal was. Seven years ago (seven?!?!) I realized that I wasn't mentally healthy. At the same time I was going through other stuff, was self medicating with weed, and had no direction in life. I had a massive breakdown/depression. Barely got out of bed, wasn't going to classes, couldn't even hold a conversation. I sort of pulled out of it but not much has gotten better.

Ever since then, i've been fighting the good fight but with little to no results. I've basically lost all of my friends or don't talk to them much. Even when I do i can't get past the fact that i went/still am crazy and can't just relax around them. Pretty much the same with family. They're more or less supportive but holidays and get togethers are fucking painful. I usually try to drink myself into being social with varying effects. 

I forced my way to getting a degree, even in that depressed state, because I didn't know what else to do. No idea how I can use that degree. I'm working a shitty job at a bank now and seem on the verge of being fired. I don't have the energy to grin and bear it. Depression is not great for customer service. I don't want to work at a bank. But i don't know what else I can or want to do. 

I'm so fucking lonely. I have no idea what to do with my life. Every day is a seesaw between extreme lows of depression and extreme highs of serious anxiety. 

I was against antidepressants but at this point it feels like I need to try something drastic. I tried Lexapro a while back for a few months and didn't notice anything change.

Anyone have any thoughts? all this time and it still feels like I'm at square one. Would really appreciate anything helpful.

"So basically since last night I have been on the panic attack rollercoaster. Crying, freaking out, insomnia, and the feeling of staring into a black hole of hopeless nothingness.

Well I did my self-care and took an emergency xanax, I've been drinking chamomile and letting the crying come when it comes. I've talked to family and they know what's going on but like...

When I'm not actually crying I don't feel a god damn thing.
I feel dead and hopeless. Nothing feels good. I look at the future and think, what's the point?

I've been trying to do cheerup things, self-care things, and all they do is make me cry in frustration.

How can I feel alive again?

"I'm a lonely person but right now I don't have any friends or at least anyone I hang out with or talk to on a regular basis. I'm unemployed and living with my mom. So it feels like I couldn't hide those facts and I don't think any girl would be able to ignore all the red flags.

That and I haven't dated anyone recently and my dating experience at the age of 33 is pretty spotty. Never been in a relationship either. 

Right now I feel like I need to focus on getting a job and getting back in shape because I've fallen off the wagon a bit. Also, I probably should try to get into some sort of activity where I could make some friends. Although, it feels like no one wants to make new friends the older you get. But I suppose I have to try anyway.

Does that sound like a decent plan?",4

"Does anyone else get in a mood like this? I feel kinda suicidal, I want to die and I imagine all of the ways that I would, but at the same time I don't want to die.

If anything ever happens, my first thought is ""man I want to die. It would be so much easier if I were to die"" but I don't always necessarily want to actually die? 

I know it's confusing, but if you understood what I meant and you feel this way too, please let me know. 

I'm just in a bad place tonight, I've been fighting with my girlfriend and I fear that we might actually break up, and it kills me. I just feel so lonely right now. ",0

"College has been the worst experience for me. I started out at a community college and then transferred to a small city college in my town that I commute to. First of all, I hated both schools generally. I had always wanted to go off to college but couldn't afford it. Anyway, I have taken only a couple classes each semester because my depression started almost immediately when I first began school. Now it's two years later, I have nothing but general courses, I thought I'd try computer science and hated it...So I'm back where I started. And everyone I went to high school with are graduating now which makes me feel so much worse. I still don't even know what I want to major in. And I really don't want to stay here for two or three more years to finish a degree. Can anyone relate?",3
"Nobody understands me so I hoped reddit could help. 

As said in the title, I am 14 years old. I am struggling with terrible memory. I will give a few examples.

At school we were passed out tests. Since we share tables, we got 4 papers on one table. I wrote my name down and was waiting for further instructions until I heard someone say ""wow you are fucking retarded"" to me. I was in shock. I asked why acting like my feelings weren't hurt and he held up two papers to my face. I wrote my name on two papers. I didn't know how it happened and nobody else wrote it because it was my writing. I know I did it. And to be honest, I was about to write my name on a third paper. 

When a friend pours out his heart telling me about his problems and personal problems, I forget them within 10 minutes and when I asked him what it was again he thought I was a terrible friend. I didn't know what to do. 

There's not a day at school I have kept one pencil throughout the whole day. I always forget and I can tell the teachers are pissed because I am constantly asking if they have one.

I constantly ask my friends about questions in class and I asked him so many times he told me to shut the fuck up. He apologized and was just angry I was constantly bugging him but now that I can't ask him it is affecting my grades.

Speaking.of which, my grades are plummeting. My father asked if I am studying and doing my homework and I am, I study every night even on breaks and I still fail. I once studied for a quiz for three hours and got a 46 percent. 

I can't remember my childhood. I forget I had one. It's almost like I was born at the age of 12 because that's as far as I can remember. I have no memories of my childhood.

I loved my grandma. Ever since I was a baby I constantly went to her house on the weekends and she was like a parent to me. We were tight. When she passed away from the evil hands of cancer I couldnt remember her face. I cried to god because I could not remember her. I asked what was wrong with me. So far, religion has helped me none.

I have not told anyone this but I still don't know my multiplication tables. I'm not even good with addition. If you asked me what 8 * 9 is I would take a calculator for me to figure it out. A high school teacher pointed it out to me and I have been hurt ever since. I remember I forgot everything over the summer of 5th grade, and when 6th grade came along I had to ask my teacher how to multiply. She thought I was an idiot. All she said was ""Ha, you don't know yet?"". Looked at me like I was an alien. I looked at her for a minute and said nothing. Then went back to my seat, sat down, and thought I was a fool. 

I forget my families birthdays.

I forget basic mathmatics.

I forget my address.

I forget my phone number.

I forget my passions.

I forget my dreams.

I even forget my age.

I thought my cat was 1, turns out after my sister laughed for 15 minutes she told me he was 3.

I love my cat.

I've had dozens of people in my life tell me I'm stupid. I get bullied because of my memory loss. I get called mental almost every day. my closest friends think I am an idiot. My teachers, my parents, all of my loved ones, etc think I am stupid.

I told my father this. I started crying in front of him and you know what he told me?

You don't listen.

I have not visited a doctor because my dad doesn't believe me.

Please somebody, what is wrong with me. I go to bed at 8 and wake up at 7, I love to eat healthy because my mom force fed me salad as a child (I don't remember that), I have not had depression or anxiety until now because only now I wonder why I am this way, I do cross country, and I am an overall healthy boy.

For the love of God somebody help me.",4
"THIS IS A FOLLOW UP TO MY PREVIOUS POST.

Start of 6th grade,my classroom was empty and as a class,we were assigned to decorate the classroom.

After years of miserable group work,I realised that no one accepts my opinions,this time was stupid as I am one of the best students at art,and NO ONE asked my for help,they kept calling me irrelavant and useless.So I decided to sweep the classroom,as Singaporeans,we never-EVER,clean up after one another,So the class looked like the aftermath of a party,From then,I started sweeping for hours,instead of appreciating me efforts to help,many just laughed at me for being that ""Cleaner boy"" and others made facial expressions that looked like I was bothering them,whenever I went to their side to clean up.

After that,I went for a rest,at my seat,which a group of people are working on stuff on,when I jokingly said a joke (Obviously),they just shooed me off and called me ""The useless one"",seriously,did no one realise how clean the room was after I swept?

Now the most horrible part:Some time later,get this,MY TEACHER COMPLAINED ABOUT HOW THE CLASSROOM WAS DIRTY!At this point I was all ready to commit murder already,fucking trashwhore,If i didn't make an effort to clean up the class,I tell you,bitch,your classroom will look like a fucking garbage disposal.

LITTLE THINGS THAT RUIN MY DAY:

I went up to a group of kids,and kindly asked if they got any trash for me,one of them said: ""YOU!"" I laughed it off,but deep down I was heartbroken.After the teacher complained,I was pissed,some one asked me for help,and I said no,he said: ""Why did you not help us the whole time?"" I swear,if I was in the US with that fuckboi,I will shoot off his limbs and pour salt on the wounds.

YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THIS PART IF YOU READ MY PREVIOUS POST.
The girl that I liked who was in front of me?Well,she got to be even better friends with that fuckface,while I just sit here,going through the utter misery of getting a heartache every time I look at her,while I sit here in my lonely area,dying.

"I'm gonna write an essay venting here so incoming wall of text.

I see a lot of posts on here which revolve around unemployment, lack of academic achievement, ""failure"" in one aspect or another, and I can relate to those things, but I'm on the other side and I feel worse now more than ever.

I've always had depression come and go, and maybe that's generally normal, but I did relatively well for myself anyways. I had fun in college, met some really cool people, was in a frat and a few other organizations, generally had a good time. I don't think I've ever had a close friend but that never really bothered me, I am super introverted by nature and can easily spend a month without human contact and be just fine. I graduated with a good major and good grades, I got a good job right out of college at an employer that hires 1% of applicants, 3 months later I quit because I got an offer from another employer that hires even more selectively, I moved to a cool city on the west coast. I don't have any large insecurities, I feel that I'm relatively smarter than most people, a good employee and a person worth hiring at any job in my field. I do fine with women generally, never had a serious girlfriend because I always lose interest in people and I prefer being alone when I'm not working because I find people to be exhausting.

I have a cool apartment in the downtown area, I have a ""great job"" which people are jealous of, old friends hit me up asking for interview advice and references. I'm 23 and on my way to making 6 figures relatively soon.

I did everything right, my parents are proud of me, everyone treats me well, and even more so when they know you're successful and have money, but that can be an entirely different post. All this doesn't even matter because I'm more depressed today than I ever have been.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I have no true for ambition for corporate life, I find everything to be pointless and stupid, I'm really fucking good at pretending to be ambitious, and telling people what they want to here which is why interviewing has always been easy for me. But at my core, I don't give a fuck about anything, I feel like a zombie working from 9-7 every weekday to finally reach the weekend, have it fly by and then rinse and repeat. I really just want to do NOTHING, maybe read something I enjoy, play some video games, or find a new hobby or whatever but working makes me want to kill myself more and more everyday. 

Does that make me lazy as fuck? Probably, I don't know, that's what I get told whenever I express discontent with the work life. I don't care about material things beyond a few necessities and some hobbies. If I had enough money to pay my rent and a little extra for the rest of my life I would quit immediately.

My only goal in life is to have enough money so I don't need to have anymore goals. Goals are bullshit, ""oh if I work really hard I can be the financial MANAGER in a few years and make more money, then I can get a cooler apartment or a nice house and continue slaving away until I'm an old man die."" It's all just bullshit, who gives a fuck. Why would I want a job with more responsibilities which gives me more money I don't use, it all feels like a giant joke.

The only hope that keeps me going is somehow finding a way out and having enough money/passive income to retire, but the thought that it may take 15 years or more makes it seem useless. I feel like my youth is slipping away, I'm tired everyday, I have trouble sleeping, even my hair is starting to fall out which is fucking depressing.

I have a few thousand in savings after sending money home to support my parents, with barely any free time or energy to find something I can invest in. I'm stuck working and watching time fly by week after week. It feels like a hopeless cycle with no escape, like no matter what I do I'm destined to working some zombie office job until I'm an old man until I can finally retire and die. I want to throw all my money in a business idea or something but with my current energy and time and mental state, I would probably fail miserably and lose all my money and go back to square one.

Everything is depressing, I just want to disappear.

"I pretty much spent the whole of last year quite depressed. I knew something was
up with me so recently I started taking anti depressants (non SSRI) and only now im actually starting to feel something, do I realise just how long I was numb for. 

It was hard to describe to my girlfriend that I wasnt upset or unhappy I was just unable to feel anything at all... I would have loved to have been able to be unhappy about something. To feel the intense emotions of unhappiness (like from a break up or something) would've been such a welcome change from the void I was in.
